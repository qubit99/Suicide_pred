0,Giving Up,"I am 17 years old and feel very alone. My relationship with my family is very messed up, I feel I have given up on trying to improve myself anymore for them because I keep screwing things up so much. (Like following rules, etc.) The only person I really really care about right now is my girlfriend, but we don't live so close to each other and therefore we've been having many problems communicating. She also takes advantage of the distance by leaving me for hours at a time whenever she is upset about something, leaving me very anxious and waiting for her to reply. It messes with me so much because I love her so much and my love is constantly thrown to the side whenever she gets upset since it's usually related to me. I don't know what to do because the ways I have to talk to her are getting taken from me from my family since I have started giving up on trying."
1,Stepping away from the ledge,How do i start.
2,"I dont know what else to do whats wrong with me, Ive lost everything","im 23, male"
3,What to do in crisis situations?,"I have quite a bad depression for which I have to take medication. As far as I can tell it's mostly due to my loneliness. When you're nearing 30 and still hoping for your first kiss it just really wears on you. As long as there is someone I can view as a potential partner, I can manage it decently thanks to my medication, but as I recently faced rejection all my usual depressive symptoms came back in full force. I usually get stuck in a situation where I'm unable to do anything but lay down and cry and it can last hours. It is at these points, that suicide feels like the only option. As unfortunate as it is, if I had access to something that'd dispatch me quickly and painlessly like a bullet to the brain, I would in all likelihood wouldn't even be here."
4,Super depressed,Wake up feeling bad. Same anxieties returning over and over. Gets old.
5,Lost Identity and Hope,"I have been stricken with the loss of my identity. Due to the fact that I have lost basically every meaningful thing in my life; My relationship, my house, my job, my money, my family and friends. I feel all is lost...this life isnt worth it anymore. I cant overcome the tremendous loss(es) I have been dealt with over past 2 years...now it seems i lost my faith and any hope..."
6,I just want to end it all.,"Hi everyone. I don’t know what to do I feel so lost and empty. Basically a backstory when I was 16 I had my virginity taken by a rapist which scarred me. A short while after this event I met a boy who I fell in love with, he made me very happy but he broke up with me suddenly and I’ve been depressed since. I engaged in promiscuous behavior I’m not proud of and I’ve had sex with 17 men. One of them told me that he tested positive for hepatitis c which means I might have it. I’m getting tested today and I’m terrified. I already feel that my life isn’t worth sh*t and if I test positive I’m really going to feel worthless. Every time i think things are getting better they don’t. I’m able to meet guys but they usually are just interested in sex. I recently met a guy who I fancied but I ended up sleeping over his house and putting out on the first date, and now he switched up and is acting indifferent towards me. I know I have nobody to blame but myself. I’m not a sex addict or something the truth is being raped made me so jaded towards it it doesn’t mean sh*t to me now so I end up putting out because it’s difficult for me to say no."
7,Does medication work on the long term?,"Some say medication is used only to surpress feelings, to pack it down into your archive instead of healing it. My cousin needed a month to find the type of antidepressant that worked for her. After taking these for another whole month, all while also using meds to protect her stomach, she became addicted to them. She had to slowly break down her usage to zero and this took another whole month. After quitting her depression simply showed up again."
8,Just Done,"This is so hard to write, I know my feelings are not forever but I just can’t get past how horrible everything feels. I don’t want to do anything to myself, but I also don’t care to be trapped in my crappy life anymore. If you’re inclined to read this, I’m happy to hear any suggestions other than hating every minute of every day."
9,"Too suicidal to live, but too scared to commit suicide","My earliest memory of suicide was when I was 10. I tried to hang myself with a bath towel. I didn't grow up in a loving household, however it wasn't an abusive one either. We rarely had family dinners and no one seemed to ever care what was going on with each other. It was a very lonely childhood. I never misbehaved or got into trouble so I was left alone. Like a living ghost in my home. I remember having a teddybear who I fantasized would give me fatherly advice. Sad emotions were a taboo in my family, and very much still are 23 years later."
10,Help,I am a porn addict living a lie.
11,Boyfriend of ten years committed suicide and now I'm really struggling,"Recently I experienced the most tragic loss, I have ever had to face, my beautiful partner of ten years committed suicide and since his death I am struggling to think of reasons to live myself, his departing has put holes in my heart that cannot be filled, I feel beyond empty, emotionally drained every day, every morning I wake up and everything seems so futile, even something as simple as having a shower, every normal action has lost meaning, I've been told a number of things, such as ""Time will heal all"" And ""You'll find someone else"" ""Things will get better"" things that I feel are said with the best intentions but offer little comfort, I am totally and utterly lost without him, we talked of having children, maybe getting married, we were both studying, it really was such a shock for everyone who knew him. I knew he was depressed but I never thought he would take his own life."
12,I Wanna Take My Life,"Even tho i have been talked out of committing suicide more times than i can count but i still think about it -- i'll be fine and go to the store and walk by something a have the worst thoughts, like i walk into the cooking isle and see the knives and think what i could do w/ one. Even tho I haven't OD in a while i still think bout it -- Worst of all i still think about my plan, where and when and how...."
13,im losing hope,I have been at the point of where I don't even want to be on this earth anymore. Im losing my faith I need someone to talk to my best friend that is like a sister to me is angry and blocked me I broke a rule and I feel I lost her and I don't know how to fix this at all plus I'm so sad now I mean its a huge fight i had and i have tried speaking to her .
14,I just can't deal with these things anymore,"Just as I started a new job, a new life after my ex moved out, things again took a different turn as I expected."
17,Cant fight anymore,I will try to make this as short as I can.
18,Worried about my friend,My friend has been going through mental issues as long as I can remember.
19,I miss him,I don’t know what to do. My husband and I have a son who was stillborn three years ago. Since then we have had two living children. I have developed an anxiety disorder as well as an eating disorder and OCD. These things I feel make me a bad influence and role model for my girls. I am a horrible wife and can’t stand my husband most of the time. I threaten to divorce him then beg for him back on a monthly basis.
20,Why is this wrong?,"I hate that the greatest lie I've ever told is ""I'm fine."" It has never nor will it ever be the truth. I am not being emotional anymore. This is not some thought because of some emotionally shattering event. This wish for death, to stop existing in the world doesn't go away when I genuinely smile or laugh. It doesn't go away when everything that could go right, does just that. This is thought out. I know The unfortunate people that I may hurt. I know the consequences. I know what I want So why is it wrong? Why is almost every suicide attempt treated the same? Every time I go to therapy or to those hospitals after a 5150, all I hear is about how things get better. How I might get through this. The gist is they think those feelings will settle down enough for me to live a life and finally see the bright colors of life one day. They think I just want to do this because of a momentary laps in judgment. I want this. I want to die and the only reason I'm not now is because they made the easiest and most effective ways to carry this out impossible for me. They made it so I can be ""Saved"" ff I try again on pills, cutting, or some other slow method of death. I do not want to be saved. I do not want to go into this then wake up in some hospital. I do not want to one day wake up from this and be put into a life with even more hurdles and disabilities, or even just be put in a coma. I do not want to became even more burdening to someone else. I just want to die. To do it in a way I cant come back, and a way I wont wake up to even more hardships to bare for myself and those around me. Why does everyone say its wrong for me to want this? That its wrong for me to try and carry this out on my own? I just wish to fade out. I've worked now for so long just to put myself in a position where me just dying and disappearing will have the least amount of emotional strain on those around me. I know family and friends and all that say they'll be heart broken but time heals. They will move on with their lives and carry out their dreams. They'll have their wants and I'll have mine. This 5150 has 4 more years to go. After that I go. I just really hope no one tries to stop me"
21,I know I'm suicidal,"For whatever reason, I grew up being suicidal. I can recall being six years old and wishing I was dead. I fantasized about it regularly. All the way into my mid-20s. As result of whatever self-work I did in my mid-20s I hit a strange/surreal point: I stopped thinking about suicide but not on purpose. On some random day, i said in my mind, ""What a minute. I haven't thought about suicide in maybe months."""
22,I'm done,"Mid 40s. Been dealing with depression for the last 20 years. Laundry list of medications, none of which worked. Tried ECT, TCM, therapy, etc. I have considered killing myself several times over the years but because of my own fears and my family, I have never pursued it with intent. A big part of my depression is my lack of ability to have a serious relationship over the past 25 years. I don't know if this is the root cause of the depression or a side effect of it. I thought in my younger days that in order to attract women, I need to be the best person I can be. I've managed to be fairly successful. I'm a professor and I'm pretty well known in my field. I stay in pretty good shape, enough to complete in crossfit competitions. But frankly, my work and my other pursuits don't bring me any joy anymore. The fact that I'm not in a relationship and I don't have a family weighs heavily on me. I've come to the point where everything in life seems pretty pointless. I'm beginning to think it is time."
23,I want to commit suicide,"I once watched a video on yt titled 'if you want to commit suicide, watch this video first'. I watched it until the end. It told me to talk to someone before I commit suicide."
25,Having a hard time tonight,"I'm a 26 year old gay male. I'm a good guy who is not into the crazy lifestyle that most people thrive off of. I don't party, drink, hook up or anything of that nature. I don't hang out with a lot of people because I don't agree with there lifestyles. I met this guy on Adam4adam in person. Fist time ever on that site, because it is primarily about hooking up. His name is Jeff, and I was totally up front with him about my lifestye. We have hung out 6 times, and it has been pretty good except I noticed he is a very sexual person and I am more into love and compassion. We both like to see each other weekly and want to get to know each other. We were talking last night and he was talking about how we were a good match and I replied ""I love my Jamaican man"" referring to him. Then he texted ""What are you trying to get this excited work"". Then I asked him why he was feeling down, because he mentioned he was earlier in the conversation. I never heard from him, and messaged him later and told him how I love his culture, and that I said that because I am proud to be with someone of that race. I've been trying to call him and asked him what is having an issues about. He won't respond to me at all. I'm really sad because I feel like I'm going to lose him over something so silly. I told myself I'd never been with anyone again because it can be really stressful sometimes and it's sooo hard to find someone I feel compatible with. Or who accepts me for my reserved lifestyle."
26,Feeling low/suicidal,"Hi my ex broke gf just broke up with me 2 months ago. We’ve spoken everyday. It was long distance her Uk me Australia, we discussed last week that we would consider getting back together once my citizenship is approved. She went away for the weekend to Italy on a romantic vacation with her new gf she never told me she was seeing anyone til just over a week ago. I reacted badly over the weekend to it was quiet nasty to her and now she says that any chance of us getting back together is out the window. I too have contemplated killing myself I’ve sat here all day working out which way to do it but I’m trying to be strong. I just can’t work out how to let her go or move on! The pain is deep. My hearts shattered. I need help but I know talking to someone doesn’t stop the pain and suicide isn’t the answer it’s working out how to let go and live without her I’m so lost."
27,I Just Do not Want to Feel Anymore,"Lately my life has been extra amounts of disappointment, sadness, regret, and depressing. I've been seeking help from a therapist and she has helped me see alot of things about my depression i never really thought about. But now knowing it makes it feel all worse. I've always felt like i was never worth the time to anyone. I guess this stems from my birth father abandoning me before I was born. He called my mom a for trying to get in between his own wife who was also pregnant, called her a and shamed her because she had to test 2 separate guys, and was shammed and embarrassed because my grand parents had to be the ones to catch her and help her both financially and take control of how they would proceed regarding my father. They all just let him go. Let him leave. And I see that now I try to prove my worth to not just my mom for having put her through all of that, but I also seek to have other people see me as useful and worth their time. That somehow that gives me worth. Problem is when I'm alone. How I think about me when there is not anyone around to please. I hate myself. I think I should have never been born. I feel bad that I leach onto people and just suck gratitude for my own self image. Next I guess is my family. My grand parents entered the picture really early on but from the moment I could understand things, Ive seen they never liked me. That I was a stain on more or less perfect image of their family. That my mom choosing to not give me up to adoption was going to ruin the christian image of my family. But they kind of sucked it up. Not without still taking it out on me. They constantly expected me to be better. To fill a role for them and for the family. This has always felt to me like they just wanted me to prove to them and those who looked down on my family, that I was not a mistake. Even when I hit the point where I wanted to meet my father they told me to wait and go to him after I've proven myself and make him regret leaving. I had to show my worth to everyone. Worse was my cousins I feel got jealous. My grand parents to them where kind loving and like grandparents always are said to normally be. But to the cousins I got extra attention, and they were the ones that raised me. So they started playing a game. Whenever any of the cousins got together they ignored me or picked on me for any little mistake or problem. One on One they were all kind and I loved spending time with them. But as a group they made me feel so small. Like if I had proven my worth to them before, it didn't matter now. I was the freak. The black sheep. The bastard child. They all looked down on my mom. Seeing this started the feelings that no mater what I do I'm not going to ever succeed on proving myself worthy of life. Worth the time and effort to keep my going. I guess the last thing is really the relationships I have had. Not just romantic. Friends to me have done the same thing. That event when kids can be kind in one moment then get in a group and change to fit what is normal. I've never fit into that. I've liked so many things in my life even up until recently and no matter what it is, Its not normal, its weird, and I am weird for liking it. I know I put my worth in the hands of others, and I know that why those comments always hit me so hard. Worse is those romantic relationships. Its happened a lot before in friendships before I started dating, but I know I get easily used. I'm vulnerable and I just let people come in and take what they want, but it hearts way worse from someone I trusted with my heart. Someone I was happy being around and I thought I brought joy to as much as they brought it to me. They all were bad. But the one example of how bad they got was with the girl I had a crush on in high school. We didn't date in high school, talked a bunch and were friends but she never saw me much more then a decent guy. No I left school for 3 years then met back up with her. I at that time really liked one of her friends that I worked with. I was seeing this girl for a bit, but my ex was helping me. Talking to her friend and giving me advice. She also liked one of my roommates. We tried with these other people and that didn't work out. Then she went after my other roommate. I gave her advice and I started to feel for her, but I didn't want to be with a girl who was seemingly working through the house, and who I knew just became buddies with the newer roommate. Once he was done with her he dropped her. She had her own depression and experiences that she had and I became the one to try and help. I guess she started feeling for me but I was still conflicted with just that recent past. Finally I gave in and started dating her. I was happy. I loved her and she said she loved me. For 7 months we dated until her issues with her family came hostile. I said I would let her move in with my temporarily until her friend got ready to move in with my ex. But a month past, then a few more, until she was there for another 6 months. She made rules for me and made me cut out friends she thought weren't good for me. Guilt ed me into doing things I had not wanted to do. My best friends that she had tried to date left because she made it unbearable for them to stay, and she convinced me that they were abandoning me. She became a pillar of support in my mind. But one day it seemed like she stopped caring. Her rules where still in place for me but, they didn't apply to her. I couldn't hang out with friends of the opposite sex but she was fine doing so. And if I said anything about it shed get angry and its my fault because i brought it up. I was controlling her apparently. We were dating for a year and a half at this point and for another 6 months she just sat in the room playing games every day until she needed to go to work. And some days she didn't come home. Out with the guy she knew I was uncomfortable with. I felt broken a bit then. Like I was unappreciated for trying to help her and now felt mostly alone because she was never there. At the job I helped her get working with me I was visibly depressed and it was all inwards. IO thought What did I do wrong. I must not be doing enough. I m a terrible person if she feels like this. Turns out she started telling our boss and co workers. and one day I looked at the schedule and I wasn't on there anymore. My name was there but no hours. I asked my boss and she told me that everyone in the store asked to no longer work with me. Said shell give me hours the next week but I knew she had to say that. I was pushed out. So i put in a two weeks and ended it. Decided Id start college and make that my priority. To get me and my ex out of this area and make a happy life together. But then she told me. She didn't love me anymore. Didn't think she ever loved me. so she said we should go on a break. Distance makes the heart grow fonder i guess. one day in she both called me up in the middle of the night and told me she made a mistake. then the next morning she made her decisions. She went over the guy I was uncomfortable with whom I also used to work with at the previous job. Then made her decision then. She was done. But she didn't want to make my financially unstable or herself and still wanted to be friends. So she said shell stay living with me. I made one request so I could heal. Don't date anyone especially that guy, if your gonna live with me. That would push me over the edge. this all happened about a week before our anniversary. Then she came home one day. Every night going to that guys house always super late at night. Then I see her in her room deleting all pictures she had of me. During this week she wasn't even nice to me. Getting upset and literally saying not my problem to me when needing to talk about my depression. Then I saw her phone. She just went to check her messages and there it was. When we where together but she fell out of love with me she started hiding her phone. Even caught her texting in the middle of the night and when asking what she was doing, she would shut her screen off and get upset with me for asking. It made sense. All the time with that guy she spent in our relationship, she was cheating. Even her brother told me she was afterwords. and now she was in a relationship with me. this was a day after our anniversary would have been. I broke down. I tried to end my life then too. I felt used like I had before in other relationships and was only good for what I provided. She was even planning on using me even after breaking up with me. I got through that. I knew I wouldn't be able to love much after that. I held my heart tightly and tried to guard it. But I got a new job and was out there still flirt and even seeing other people. Had a few more bad ones but then the most recent. 2 weeks ago from this post in fact. I started dating this girl while she was still in a relationship. In truth I felt terrible about it. I was her supervisor at work and we knew we were a bit iffy in terms of the moral and corporate problems. But we had fun. We were ourselves and happy. She had been in a relationship and lived with this guy that took her for granted and expected things out of her instead of seeing her as a treasure. She was kind but stubborn, had ambition, desires, and knew how she was going to get them., but I thought she was respectful. After a while we both felt that it was best to get her out and time where her ex might find out was running out. So I offered to help her for a while. We agreed to make it temporary. She knew about the last girl I talked about and knew the damage emotionally she did. This new girl new about my depression, and she was wanting to prove herself to me seemingly. That she wanted to be in my life. She sat me down and told me that if it even came to needing to take a break form the relationship she would hurt but she would understand and do so with every intent that we would be together again. So we moved out of that guys place in one day while he was at work but she didn't ever talk to him after that. She left the silence as a break up. We set the rules and what we are comfortable with and we were doing well. But something started changing. This girl had her own past and one of those things were being sexual assaulted by her ex faience. After she borke it off with him for cheating on her he came back. Started talking to her while she was with someone else. And she told me she felt those feelings for her ex then. She met with him when he came back in town a place where she felt shed be safe with others, but the others all left. Her ex used words and her dreams to talk her into giving in little by little. Until he was done. I know in order for her to heal she had to say it wasn't her fault. That she wasn't guilty of going there to him. But it started feeling obvious that she still applies that idea she didn't do anything wrong to everything to this day. One month into living with her and she was accusing me of taking away all her time to make the free bedroom into her office. I know I made a mistake in not seeing time working on the room or just casually hanging out as quality time with her, but I wanted her to feel like that room was hers, and that I wasn't in her way. That she could make that room however she wanted. One day she stopped working on it and other days she also started hanging out with someone I found uncomfortable. This person was another one of her exes that she started recently reconnecting with. I told her it was uncomfortable but all I asked was not to hang out alone with him. if she was with people I knew would help watch over her and make sure that sexual assault wouldn't happen again. But to her that was controlling. All I wanted was her to be safe and yeah I didn't want to be cheated on again. but it was not my intention to pry into what was going on in those group situations. As long as I knew she was safe and happy. 2 Weeks ago though I went to work. I was stressed out by the night before and the issue i thought was happening. That she wasn't willing to change or adapt for me even though I had been so much to accommodate both her living with me and her boundaries and wants. On that day I was told by my mother that this girl was moving out. She had that ex and another guy pulling out all her stuff. I tried to call her while i was at work and finally got to talk to her only be calling my mom and my mom handing the phone to her. She just kept saying to stay at work. I felt myself breaking then. I left work and ran home locked those guys out and just begged for her to talk to me. That she can still move out fine. I knew this was temporary living but why could she not just talk to me before hand or tell me what was going on. After it all I was told she asked my mom how I would feel about her moving into that exes house and what I might do. She knew I was inwardly hostile but I wouldn't hurt anyone else. within the 2 weeks we did talk a bit. One thing was that at that time she was scared of me. That I would hurt her, her stuff, or her cats. After that day I tried to take my life again. I was stopped by my mother and the police that that ex called on me saying I was violent and going to hurt her. The next day I was let go and she came over again, the told me that she would be coming over and i made the one rule that if her ex comes with her i wont let anyone in the house. That I was shown so little care already and I dont want him around my home. At first he wasn't there, just her moms and the friend that set us up more or less. But he came. After I had let her come in to help me get her cats in carrier and we talked about the issues. That we both agreed it was soon to move into together and we never learned the quirks of talking and understanding one another. Words we used with each other meant and came off differently then the intent of the user. And that was fine. It was nice. We agreed that wed because of the situation take a break of sorts. Still be that we are in a relationship, just taking time for at least a week in order to think, recharge and maybe get back together. Maybe was a big thing though. She had been hurt in her past be more then just the sexual assault. A past full of guys that would say and do anything to get her back in bed or like her father just use her and see her more like a tool then a person. She knew that one other problem was that she saw me as a mixture of all the men in her past. they goggles she was wearing where so covered in the that those guys threw her way that when she looked at me she saw the shape but couldn't see who i was really. She had throughout our relationship compared me and told me she saw things that reminded her of them but I always tried to talk to her and show her, even change so I wouldn't be like them. and thought the 2 weeks I was trying a lot to prove to her that I wasn't them. that she was important to me that I can and will change for the better to make sure she feel comfortable. In this 2 weeks we hung out multiple times and even cuddled and laughed. Things where like when we first started dating. And I made it clear that It still wasn't okay the way she left. I had my feelings about this whole thing to, but she was more important then anger or sadness. When we where talking and together in person things felt nice. really happy and like we were making good progress on talking to and understanding one another. But, I dont know maybe she really felt it wasn't intentional to do any of this but, the friend who set us up told me my now ex made up her mind at the beginning of all of this. Well a few events happened in the past 2 weeks. One was My birthday, the day before thanksgiving. This day is an example of why i pointed out we were good in person together. In text she told me she was tired and that my birthday didn't matter enough to her for her to spend that day with me. She she told herself shed have dinner with me then go hang out with her friends alone then go home. She even told me that in truth she didn't even want to go at all, she was thinking of just canceling. Made a point to say I better feel special. but then that night we talked a lot and tried to clear the confusion a bit more. Throughout this time I always prefaced that I dont want her to give me her answer, just her thoughts at the moment. A way for me to deal with the silence and uncertainty from her day by day. I told her that the feelings of unknown hurt more then just ripping the band aid off. that closure was more important for my state of mind then anything and that i just needed hope that she wouldn't do the same thing as she did her ex. Just stop talking to, block from everything, and that is breaking up. When I found out that she made up her mind with no other information I started to break again. Our friend also told me that this ex also made a rule that she could not talk to me while he was around or at the house that she moved into with him and the other guy from the first day. The thoughts swarmed in my head. Was she just using me and being kind to me because she just wanted to get the rest of her stuff. And why wait? Why string me along for 2 weeks. in this time I started to see things I didn't pay attention to before. Things like she was willing in order to get more money to push out the friend who set us up together, and justified it by saying that this friend was young and could fail or fall, run back to home, and start over. it wouldn't be the end of the world for her. I also saw she would never say sorry even if she walked over your feet. She felt no guilty for moving out the way she did and she felt no guilt or blame for everything shes ever done. She was willing to do anything to get what she wanted even if it meant stepping on others to reach it. And I was that step. Maybe she didn't intend all this and maybe it wasn't all true. But I needed to know. I called her and left her a few messages about what I knew a bit about what I thought and I prefaced this is only my thoughts not the truth I have fully accepted as such. But if its true then to break up with me. To just pull the band aid off so I can see the wound and move on and let it heal. So now words from her. She blocked my numbers, blocked me on everything, and I haven't heard from her at all in the past few days. But truth is I always felt that I had an emptiness in me and after that first girl I mentioned I felt broke. I rebuilt a bit but this newer girl I told myself that she was important enough to put in my all, and make her feel loved, and cherished, and respected, like the other men in her life never did. She told me about her dreams of having her own place again with her cats where she can say its all hers. Her space. And she wanted to be more independent. Not feel like she was leaching or being held up by others. And those thoughts were things we talked about. That I want her to feel she has her own space and home, so I've been supporting her however she wants on finding that place. And I've made sure to back away from her so she feels like she can do things on her own but that if she stumbles or starts to fall that its not her relying on the help, and shes not not independent for having someone who want to be there to make sure she never has to feel the fall to the ground. Just to have back up. Truth is though I never got that closure. I dont know if she hates me, never loved me, left just because she wants her independence, or if i was left for the other guy. There is so many other things and I'm still living in the dark not knowing anything. the band aid is mostly ripped but the evidence of what caused the wound cant be known without seeing all the wound. And it hurts, every day it hurts. This time is worse then all the others. I put in all that I had left into this one and the emptiness inside me feels bigger. Not just bigger hole, more like there isn't anything left. It all feels gone. I dont have the drive to pick up again and start over. I dont feel like I have those dreams for my future any longer. I close my eyes and see no hope. no anything but the darkness in me now. And I still love her. If she did those bad things intentionally or unintentionally, I love her, but its not all about her. The darker thoughts just tell me over and over again ""See your not worth it."" The one you thought was different you turned into the same as all the rest. You failed to prove your worth the life your mother gave you, and the time she gave you. Everyone hates you obviously they are only kind to you by themselves because they have some sense of fear or guilt they might feel telling me I'm not worth it. They dont want to individually be responsible for my state of mind so they just wait and act until they get back with the group. The one person I know cares about me unconditionally is my mom, and i know I dont deserve that love. I can prove to her that I was worth all she went through. About 4 months ago my aunt shot herself in the head. No note, no warnings. She was just seen before that with my great grandmother and grandmother and she was smiling and going through her day. I see her as brave. To me she finally stopped living for other people and did what she wanted. I know its selfish to not think of how it affects others, but I've lived my life trying to make others happy and like me and see my worth as a person. I want to finally live for me, to do what I want and make myself finally feel free from it all. The expectations, the thoughts I'm not worth it, from those who just use me, and those who cant or wont see I try. I'm tired of always feeling I have no accomplishments. Everywhere I try to make others happy is always undercut but the end results. I try at a job for 2 years and make everyone see I'm good at what I do. I help and come in when needed, I do what is asked, even do other peoples jobs that they themselves never want to do. Then I bring in a person that I care about even in other examples just a new person comes in in general, and because they have a problem with me they start talking. They turn all the people I thought saw my worth and cared, against me. They turned so fast and so completely, that all that time and effort is gone. I've lost all of it and didn't even get the closure to think maybe I can rebuild and move on. I think back in my life and I see happy memories but they are all sad, because in the end of those they all end badly. Either someone, something, or even myself ruined it all. And people keep trying to tell me its just one situation, or one thing. that time will heal it. I just dont see it. Its so much more. I'm tired of feeling like this every day. I just wish and want it all to go away. To feel free and do what I want for me for once in my life."
28,How to start caring about my life?,Hi everyone.
29,suicide is d only option for me?,"I am having many difficulties like people skills, social anxiety, judgmental abt ownself, overthinking, what others will say or judge. But actually I only judge myself."
32,Death's Embrace,"I wish for death to come and finally take me into its embrace. That I be free of the pain in my heart and mind. I wish I could choose to ignore and be free of these feelings. To live and move on but I feel I can't. I feel that the consequences and retribution of the things I've made others feel and do, will haunt me forever. No matter what I do I can never atone for it all. To never be a person others don't learn to regret giving their time to. I don't feel I'm worth it to anyone in the end. I wish to fade. To stop existing. To never been seen again. I wish I could choose never to have been born. To have been given the real choice that matters. The choice to live but that was never mine to choose. If it was, I would never have been. That is my biggest regret. To be alive was something I never have wanted. To be alive is regretful. To be seen and exist. All I do is make others learn to hate me. It's so wrong for me to do this. To make others feel regret they ever gave me time. I wish I could lay somewhere no one could ever see and to wither away. But as a human I crave interaction. I know I'm not wrong for that. It's humanity that craves that feeling. I regret being brought into this humanity. If it matters anymore I choose to be free. I choose to no longer exist. I may not be able to atone for how I made others feel in life but I can give closure to all them and myself be exiting from life. Exiting from a life I never should have been given. Leaving a mother whose future was claimed by my own. Leaving a family that could have saved their time and money on anything that could bring them actual joy and happiness instead of feelings of what could have been. Leaving the people that came and went and that I only was another person in passing. And to leave the ones that I actually affected in such a terrible way. People don't need to feel the pain and regret that I bring. While I can't take back what I've done or made others feel. I can give them all peace that they no longer have to worry about my existence. They no longer have to think about me in any way. I will be air and dirty to all. Faded and unable to affect anyone ever again. For those who care I will achieve peace and for those that don't then you will feel the peace. I wish to hurt no one. I've made a choice. I will not regret it. I will not turn away from it. Death is my answer. It will take me into its embrace. I will be free. I will feel the one thing I chose. Peace."
33,No Solution,"The good news is that I have an appointment with my doctor tomorrow. I feel like I've at least made it to that. The bad news is that I'm trying to plan a suicide again. I say again because there have been mutilple attempts here in the last three years due to a divorce and a medical condition. I was very close to suceeding in September 2015 but my sister found me and called EMTs who saved my life. I lied about it at the time because I saw how freaked out she was, so I didn't get help then."
35,When it's all said and done life just keeps on going,About a year-and-a-half ago my mother committed suicide in my closet in my bedroom true story my uncle her brother found her the next morning hanging from the clothes bar... I have seven siblings and she has three grandchildren
36,Used,"I’m completely in love with this guy I’ve been intimate with for 4 years, we got into an argument and I asked him has he ever loved me and he said “no your just a friend I could never love a friend.”"
37,Depressed and alone,I feel completely useless. Im empty and alone. I don’t feel like anyone cares or anyone wants me. I’ve been in this black cloud for what It seems like forever. Im fighting so hard to stay alive but for what? Fighting hard for what purpose? Everyone Is so selfish. I’ve given so much to people that I’ve met but not one person does the same in return. Maybe I should be selfish and just be gone from this world and pain I’ve been living in. Sorry I don’t mean to be gloomy just in a dark and painful place. Needed somewhere I can just talk and be real with.
38,I want to give up.,I can't handle my life anymore.... It's not even that bad.... I just hate it....
39,"I want to end my life so I can ""start over""","I've ruined my life by listening to my family instead of doing what I wanted to do. I have a Master's degree in Fine Arts that is totally useless. As soon as I set foot on that college campus, I knew this path was not right for me but my family encouraged me to stick with it. I ended up doing so poorly in my classes that many times my professors advised me to choose another career. It took me 8 years (yes EIGHT) to finally get my Master's. Of course, I cannot get a job in my field no matter how hard I try. For the last 12 years I've been working in retail and I absolutely HATE it! Even though I constantly apply, I haven't moved passed being a Sales Associate, I'm tired of dealing with rude customers who look down on me, and the pay is miserable. My family just keeps telling me ""Things have to get better eventually."" But after 12 years, things just steadily got worse."
40,I fell so lonely..,I am 19 years old and i feel like i am all alone.. i have been thinking about committing suicide since i am like 12
41,I can't live in pain anymore,"Iknow I am being very selfish and probably sound pathetic but I have been thinking about ending my life for quite a while now. When I was little I didn't have a very good upbringing a few things happened to me that effected the rest of my life leaving me never been able to live a normal life. Teenage years I was a terror things that happened in those years also haunt me to this day the situations I got myself into, I got pregnant at 15 had a baby at 16 moved into my first house alone didn't really have any friends or a supportive family as I was kicked out at the age of 13."
42,Lost need help,I don't know where to start .i am so lost totally broken .its started when I had a retinal detachment in my eye every day I wake up and it kills me that i can't see like I use to.
43,Pushing people away,"I know it's the dumbest thing I could do but I've been pushing everyone away lately. Broke up with my boyfriend, don't spend time with my family, don't even want friends anymore. I just feel like an emotional burden for them and they deserve so much better. I know it will be harder to go through alone but I can't make them go through this with me. I just can't. Up until now I've been putting on a happy face but I don't want to be happy anymore. I want to be sad. I want to be alone. And I don't want to do anything. It was my life stressors that pushed me to this point. I am in charge of homecoming, moving for the 8th time in 3 years this week, etc. I expected so much of myself and now I feel useless and worthless cuz I can't meet those expectations. But I've had so many verbal and emotional attacks from others while planning homecoming. I already felt inadequate but now I feel completely and entirely like a waste of energy. Like why do this anymore. Why should I use so much energy to be happy when I can just bask in the solitary silence and be alone and just be sad? Being sad is so much easier. I don't even want to be alive rn but at the same time I can't imagine the pain others will deal with if I do leave..."
45,i am so ashamed i need help for self esteem and respect,"Hello everybody,"
46,My puppy died because of me and I want to die,"So, I recently got a new puppy, a yorkshire terrier. I had him for two weeks but he was so precious to me. he was always with me, slept with me, always wanted to be in my lap. I am at home most of the time since i'm a freelancer, so he was a huge company. he was so tiny and cute, almost like having a baby. i did nothing but adore him and take care of him. so today we woke up, i fed him, then most part of the afternoon i played with him, and since i usually stay up late working, i was very tired today so i took a nap. he wasn't feeling like taking a nap and was being mischievous, not letting me sleep so i let him outside my room. i also live with my brother and dad. for most of the day he was always with me, but sometimes he was around the house, always inside."
47,I'm sick and tired once again,Around two years ago I was in a really dark place and was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. I attempted suicide but lived to tell the tale and started to get counselling and was placed on medication. It wasnt easy but I did manage to get better. I started to live my life again and stupidly thought I would never go back to that dark place again.
48,Ex boyfriend commited suicide on my birthday,My ex boyfriend Killed himself last sunday on my birthday.
49,Suicide thoughts?,"Well, after many years trying to fit in a group of people and failing to do so, I finally concluded I am the one at fault for everything."
50,Can't endure this pain anymore ...,Oh god
51,Don't see a point anymore,I've felt this way for a few years now. It's been on and off but I just don't see a reason to live anymore. Nothing is going right and I can't help but mess everything up. In school one of my classes might get split because there aren't enough people taking it. That was the only class I was looking forward to and now it feels like there's no reason to go anymore if I'm getting switched into a class I don't want. I'm already so stressed out and it's only the second week of school. I put myself in a situation that I can't handle and now suicide feels like the only way out.
52,Not sure why I'm alive,"I'm nearly 35 and I feel my death would be beneficial. I don't have anything to live for, anxiety makes it hard to make friends, but if it wasn't for the loneliness I'd be content with my life; I definitely wouldn't be conflicted. On one hand I'm glad I have no one in my life, no expectations to meet, no drama and yet I feel lonely and worthless."
53,I can't go on,Where to begin
54,"After 7 years of living like this, I want to end it all and have peace of mind.",Hello.
56,How to get someone involuntarily committed?,"One of my family members is out of control. She's a mother and seems to be manic depressive, and when depressed will disappear for days at a time, abandoning her own child. She does have depression meds, but she routinely self-medicates with whatever doses she wants plus alcohol. When she's not depressed, she is a monster of human being. She listens to no one and is impossible to deal with. She's in the process of getting divorced and has her own place."
57,Only option left.. but what will happen?,"I feel this message is the last resort, I keep a diary, use tips etc to prevent myself actually comiting suicide, but the thoughts are overwhelming now, it's every hour every day, I keep myself distracted but it's always there, telling me it's the best option, what is stopping me is the fear of what will happen once I die... may sound so irrational to say that, what if I can see my children hurting and alone but am unable to reach out and hug them, I want it all to be over, but how do we know that when we go it is over? I have a plan and when I am going to do it, I can't cope with the battle in my head, I am on medication for bipolar affective disorder and have been diagnosed for few years now. Fed up of being told 'it will pass' it doesn't pass, it doesn't go away, I feel the anguish in my head and pit of my stomach, I don't know why I have come to this forum to be honest. I know I have to do it but I am scared at the same time, how does that make sense? I have picked myself up so many times for my children but they are grown now. I have no energy left to fight for a life that is unbearable. Sorry but I needed to get it out and let someone who doesn't know me, know what I intend to do."
59,The love of my life left me.,"My ex gf left me 2 weeks ago and I don't know how to cope. This woman did so much for me and I lost her. Ever waking moment I had access to not only a lover, but a best friend that we could talk about anything and had an intellectual connection that I have not had with another INdividual before, we loved each other in every aspect until she left me."
60,do I need help?,"I'm not depressed, nor do I hate life. I enjoy life and enjoy what I do, but I just don't see purpose and don't feel like living any longer. I don't cause harm to myself, but I feel that if something were to happen to me and take my life, I would be worried. Sometimes I want to just drive away without any worry, and at times I feel like if I died I wouldn't care. The only thing stopping me from actually doing something to myself is the fact that I know it would hurt the people around me. I don't live with anyone and love in a different city from my family, I'm enjoying the journey I'm on, but I'm wondering if it's the lonliness and not being with people that is making me feel this way."
61,Feeling bad,Feeling suicidal tonight. Im such a sweet girl i dont deserve this.
62,Feeling like I want to leave,Every day is a struggle. I'm at an internship and I'm always told that I'm not good enough. Not sure if I can take it any longer. I'm planning my day to go.
63,Wanting To Be With Loved One In After-Life,Has anyone who has ever lost a loved one with whom they were extremely close and loved dearly ever thought about taking his/her own life so as to be with that person again in the after-life?
64,Really considering it,"It has been a month since my breakup with my gf of 6 years. I was doing alittle better, but last night and now i am experiencing the worst chest pains and nostalgic mental pains ever. I loved this woman with everything, i messed up along the way and she ended up talking to another guy before she broke up with me And left me for him within the first week of breaking up."
65,This time I'm really considering going through with it,"I have been battling with depression for 12 years. In 2010 I got diagnosed with Bipolar 1 disorder with severe anxiety and panic attacks. and was taking medication I have been to psych wards 2-3 times. Had so many hospital stays that I lost count. Once a month I loose control of my temper 2-3 times and lash out on myself rather than someone else. Everytime, I get up in the morning I don't look forward to anything. I feel like I'm a failure to myself and my family. I'm sick of doctors, medecine, in/out if hospitals and psych ward not knowing what the hell is wrong with me."
66,I don't know anything anymore,Hi
67,Make the noise stop,"I can't sleep, playing my favourite song on full volume just to block out the screaming silence."
68,For those who are Struggling,"This post is for those who are struggling with feeling hopeless and lost. I've been preparing myself to write this post for 8 days, and I think I'm ready."
69,What solutions are there?,"Hi, I know I can't commit suicide because I have kids who love me, and have friends and family (Bro, dad). But recently I have had fairly constant feelings of hopelessness. Like there's literally no point in anything. I am on medication for depression, (perhaps not enough) and I am generally a very high functioning person. I work every day, socialise with friends, but recently over the last 2 weeks I've lost hope."
70,Feelings from the girlfriend of a family member who is a survivor,I have never posted on a forum for anything before much less something this important or personal but I've heard these are good places to look for help.
71,Tired of selfish,"I am so tired of everyone telling me all the cliche excuses to go on like it's not worth it, things will get better, things will change, keep pushing forward and my favorite what about your friends and gamily. What person that claims to love abother would sit by with no answers watchin another in such complete misery and expect them to go on with a life so hurtful. That person has not expirienced no where near the pain and has even said I don't know how you do it all. Then when you say I want to end it they say you will hurt me. They watch a person waiting for change for more than 30 years go through every hurt you can think of then have no answers but the same cliches and have the audacity to say yeah but what about me."
72,A lot of on my mind,"I have been depressed for most of my adolescence. I am 17 now and things are just not getting better. My sister was raped about a year a go which was tough for our whole family and I guess that has emotionally impacted me on some level as well. My brother was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and is 25 nearly 26 now and still lives with us. He just sits around and complains about how the world is and no one loves him and how he is being watched by the NSA and all that. My mom has been depressed ever since my dad left her for someone else so she doesn't really care about anything anymore. I have no friends and so basically I don't really have anyone to talk to. My self esteem is practically non existent, however I've tried things like exercising and meeting new people to help with that but it doesn't really work. I'm most self conscious about how I look, I'm 5'2 which is extremely short and the girl I dated for a year recently told me she had been cheating on me with other guys because I wasn't good looking enough to satisfy her lust and that she dated me for the emotional support that she needed. I can't be too mad about this though because I should have expected it. It was a blessing that someone like that was ever with me. I can't talk to anyone because they all have too much to deal with right now and to them I'm the only 'normal' and 'happy' one. To sum up, I just want to die. Please help."
73,"i'm not depressed, i just dont like living or life at all","i dont have depression or any kind of mental disorder, and i'm not crazy or irrational. i've been looking around the internet for opinions about suicide and too many are saying that if you want to kill yourself then you must be sick, which just isn't the case for me."
74,Suicidal boyfriend,Hi guys!
75,Mother of 1 fighting suicidal thoughts,"My son's father had an accident 2 months after our child was born that left him a quadrapalegic. I was already dealing with post partum depression, his dad becoming paralyzed was the icing on the cake. I came out of a drunken binge 4 years later to thankfully still having my son but a bunch of charges with law enforcement. I almost ended up in prison. My son's father only live a little over 6yrs after he became paralyzed. No matter what I do I can't get me and my child ahead, even just comfortable. I have so much depression and suicidal thoughts. My family is full of awful people whom can barely take care of themselves and my sons dads family has had no contact with us since he died. It's just me trying to take care of everything and as much as I am trying I can't manage to do it. I want to take all this pain away that I feel everyday. I don't want to live life anymore. I look at my son and he is the only reason I haven't ended my life. I'm 31 and just feel like I'm at a deadend. I don't know what to do anymore."
77,Is there anything I can do to stop the pain,"I'm in the worst place of my life. And I've had a tough life. I know depression and grief and agony. But this is pure hell. I've got a chronic illness I was born with. It became life threatening 3 years ago, the same time I fell in love. He got me through it all. I've always been very strong, but I needed the strength he gave me and I survived and thrived because of him. I've battled for 3 years to stay stable. I've lost so much. I had to drop out of university, my parents divorced abruptly, I had to move home. I was constantly in and out of hospital. My mum started dating a guy my age and stop bothering to see me even when I was sick. 5 friends have died from my condition. I have been terrified of death every day. But because of my love, I could smile and be upbeat. I felt blessed. I wouldn't have given him up even for health. I'd experienced a healthy life for 20 years and it was great. But he made me feel transcendently wonderful. Even when I couldn't walk far and lost more independence. He was my light. He moved to be here with me & we were so in love. So happy."
78,Here,28f. There are things. In therapy. Honest speaking... I don't want to be here anymore. I don't see the purpose.
80,Sometimes..,"....I just want to go to a place where nothing can ever hurt me,ever again even if that place means death...."
81,i'm suicidal because of my period,"I just get my second period and i don't even know how i survived the first one.I'm 14 and i was kinda tomboish, and i love all sports,especially swimming. I was even considering to join the army some day. But not enymore. Now i feel so handycaped and useless because of my period and i hate the mess it makes. I'm just not ready. Just when my life became so simple and perfect,this hapend. I have no privacy i need in my own house. I don't know why i ever writing this right now because i know it won't change anything,but i thing it would be easy that way...I can't see terapist anyway. I know this is natural and i should get use to it but i can't! Is it really normal to bleed 10 days in month? I feel like lower being only because i'm women and i know the point of menstruation is to tell me am ready to have children but i don't want to! Whole this suffer is because of goddamn kid i don't want to have! I'm 14! Even thinking about it freaks me out! I feel like my purpose is only to born that kid and continue somebody's family tree. I'm not gay but i wish i'm man because their life have no promlems. I wanna save my self of humiliation of waring annoying diepers and just die. I wanna live, but not like this! I don't know why i writing this but i need to do what to do! Please help me I don't wanna die!"
82,I've seriously been considering suicide.,"I'm diabetic, I have clinical depression, I'm physcotic and obsessive, and am completely unmotivated"
83,Really struggling,Ok so this might be more of a rant but the underlying question is obviously 'what can I do?'
84,how to chose anoth we road,"Pushed to the point of not wanting to be alive anymore but there are four kids I am responsible for. That puts suicide off the table....but one must go on. Question is how? I am sole caregiver to kids. Sole everything around house doer. I have no friends, no hobbies that I get to practice. I am a maid cook and nanny and that's it. Not a person. It's depressing. I don't drive. Live I'm rural area and not an option to find things to do our of the house. Even a mom needs to feel like a person. I have a husband that is sex pdsesses. In a big way. It's about to destroy our family. Ge was improving but has slipped bad recentley. Pushing me to do things I don't want do which I have put a line in the sand and made it clear ask one more time and I will leave you. He won't ask now but justvsulks all day every day. He is not a friend. We don't talk ever. I have made my peace witb living with him as he is but I am so lonely and just want to feel like I am a real person who matters. I guess I just needed to get that out. Don't have nyone else to say it to"
85,Going to commit suicide over my broken heart,Im going to commit suicide over my broken heart . Its been a long time and the pain wont go away . I see suicide as my only option.
86,I'm not doing anyone any favours,"Hi all, I've posted here a few times here before so thank you for reading"
87,I'm done,"This past month and a half has been the hardest thing I've ever been through, I'm so exhausted and nothing is getting better."
88,BPD/Eupd following me around like a bad smell.,"I told my ex I would never seek help for my issues again because they won't give it. I ended up changing my mind and thinking things would be different now I'm am adult and matured a lot. But it isn't too be so. I explained what was going on at my assessment, the lady said I see you're diagnosed with eupd, I said I disagree with the diagnosis and how it doesn't fit any of my symptoms she said she will think about what I could be referred to."
89,Given up hope of things getting better.,"Hi,"
90,Dark thoughts...,"Hey,"
91,"Im 21, male ...Is there something wrong with me?",I don't know where to start... I've been crying most nights of the week for the past 4 months. I feel like i have no purpose in life. I originally wanted to be a pilot. But I was born with poor eyesight. A number of things always enter my head when ever I feel stressed and weak. My parents divorced when I was young and i didnt really grow up with any relatives around since my family relocated countries when i was seven. And even then my parents are 9 hours apart so I live with a really fragmented family. I've only ever had 2 girlfriends. The last of which was really really bad.
92,Struggling with my thoughts,I am an independent mature 32 year old that is struggling with immature thoughts of ending my life.
93,Talking to family about depression and suicide,"Hello.. not sure how to start but, I'm 19 years old and I see all my friends having the time of their lives while I'm never accomplishing anything since high school ended two years ago. Ever since I've been pretty depressed because I'm still trying to get into college but still no success (you need to pass a test to enter in my country) and honestly Ive got no hopes I'll ever be able to pass, while my sister when she was my age she was already studying at the best college in our country. So the stress and pressure are suffocating me and the tests are coming and im feeling desperate. I dont know how will I look at my family when I tell them I failed."
94,Depression,"This was my last resort on to venting. The last thing I heard from ""family"" was ""nobody wants to hear about your problems"" Everyday I feel so worthless, I don't wanna be here, I always think about taking my own life. I feel so unwanted.. always have with this family. The time I needed someone to talk to, they stabbed me in the back & I got is ""nobody wanna hear about my problems"" I felt like I never had a mom or dad figure in my life. They was never there. Never came to any of my sports game. Never heard ""I love you"" from them .. only time was when I almost took my own life. Idk what to do anymore, I push myself everyday but I don't wanna live anymore. People just think I doing this for attention. But it really isn't , I'm really feeling like this , always since I was a little girl. I keep telling my mom that everyone who is adopted is different. My heart is just filled with pure anger & hurt. & other people are sooo happy & already met there family & some people just don't care there adopted. But the way I found out & how I found out, traumatized me & hurts me till this day."
95,I had enough,"I'm not sure what I want from this topic, but I'll write."
96,30 Days to live,"I've been depressed for 16 years now. That's more that half my life and things don't feel any better. Through the years I've had reasons not to kill myself (friends, family, fear of going to hell) but I've never found a reason to actually live. I've been on different pills and seen therapists and psychologists and they only help enough to keep me from crying as often but I've never for a second stopped wanting to die. Now here I am working a job I don't want to fund a life that I don't want. I'm done. I've given myself 30 days to find a reason to live and then I'm going to kill myself. I'm tired of sticking around for other people and I'm starting to resent them all for keeping me here anyway. If they hate me, that's fine. Maybe it will help them get over my death quicker. But I can't go through day after day of constantly feeling like I'm burning alive just because they want me to."
97,Feeling awful,He hates me. I love him. I just want to die now... 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 Nothing can make me feel alive again.
98,The pain is unbearable... don't know what to do,"I guess I'll just jump right in.... I HATE myself and my life, and I think about killing myself nearly constantly. The thought of death is never far from my mind, yet I can't seem to bring myself to do it. I've tried... but I just end up sitting there with the knife, staring off into space wishing I had the testicular fortitude to actually end it for once and all."
99,No way out,"My life has become hell. I'm a pathetic 23 year old with no education living with my alcoholic abusive dad, no education, I am steadily losing all of my friends and I don't hear from them ever anymore."
100,My aunt almost killed herself yesterday...,...and she proceeded to call me today and tell me all about it.
102,"Now I am Here, Tomorrow I want to be Gone","I was the overachiever, president of the student union, editor of yearbook, MVP in volleyball, straight A student, people pleaser, hard worker, full of life and energy."
103,Still In So Much Pain,"I started a thread over a month ago explaining how I met this 54 year old man on a game that I play on my phone. I have been hurt very badly in the past and pretty much closed myself off from the world. I started playing a game on my phone in January I never talked with the other players until about a month and a half ago. I met this man we started talking thru the game then email then Skype. I never had Skype before this. He said like myself he had been hurt in the past. He promised me a friendship which I so desperately needed. I started sending him sweet Good Morning messages and then he asked me to write sexual fantasy stories for him which I did I was a writer and I figured what's the harm. Then we eventually started sexting and just use your imagination about what we did on Skype. These are things that I have never done before. I somehow allowed myself to trust him and open up to him about very personal and private things. I real believed he was true and genuine especially because of his age and him also being hurt. Things started not going to well when I realized he was starting to blow me off. He would make excuses that he was busy but still wanted me to write sex fantasies for him. Then I find out from several other players on the game that he was doing the same thing with them. It was more of a be careful of this man on the game warning. He also wrote posts on this sight several years ago basically giving a sob story about his break up with an ex girlfriend but meanwhile trying to pick up vulnerable women on this sight. He went by the name of ""Blueboy"". This man hurt me really bad. He got enjoyment out of hurting me and he made sure I knew it. I am in so much pain over him and a little over 2 weeks ago I tried to take my own life. I am still in the hospital now and will probably be here for another month while healing from my injuries. Doctors told me it's a miracle that I'm even still alive. I have been getting intense therapy also. One of my ways to heal was that I had to write an email to this man explaining how much he hurt me and humiliated me. I also asked him a lot of questions as to why he would do this. I have been hurt in so many ways in my life but would never ever hurt another person because of it. My psychologist told me not to expect any answers from him because he got everything he wanted from me. I want her to be wrong. I need these answers. I can't get this man out of my head. He's all I think about. I even have bad dreams about him. I know I have to put some of the blame on myself. I should have been more cautious and I moved way to fast with him. Anyway I sent him an email and practically begged him for some answers. He replied back a few days later saying that he needed time to reply to my email. That's all he said. I still haven't heard anything from him. How much time should I give him? I also noticed that he is still on the game everyday probably doing the same thing with even more women. He needs time to reply to my email but he is still on that game all the time. Just to let you all know my email was a very serious one. I didn't say one mean thing. I don't have it in me. I don't know what else to do. I really need answers from him. I really did care deeply for this man in some ways I still do. There is so many other details to this. The things he said to me. I believed every word of what he told me until my psychologist pointed out indiscretions in his mails and text messages as she read them all. How could I be so stupid. I try to see the good in people and all I do is get hurt by it."
104,quiet but ticking time bomb,"I sometimes cry uncontrollably, get out in public, starting to get teary eyed and have to leave before being seen. Now I always keep in mind now that antifreeze can destroy me."
106,Please help me :( i want to kil myself,"I want to kill myself but i cant because i dont want to hurt people around me. I usually think jcould never do it to them but each day im more and more tempted because of the deep pressure i have felt since a child. Im 19 and in my generation if your not beautiful then you are worthless regardless of how smart, talented, or nice you are. People always say ""looks dont matter"" etc but people treat me based on my looks my full life. I often worry about not attracting an intelligent man to have children with because he wont be attracted to me. So then i will never have children because i wont get pregnant to someone who is a fool and will raise my children that way. So then i though of getting plastic surgery but then i would be 100% fake and would still be ugly deep down. Please help me. I try so hard daily not to focus on this but it has genuinley been tearing me apart for my whole life and i feel like i can no longer cope with the constant pressure to be beautiful"
107,Suicide,"I’ve posted numerous times before and the regulars on this forum know that I work in Federal Law Enforcement. While the agency or details of my work assignments are insignificant, the human aspect of my work has direct has an inherent amount of risk, pressure (and at the same time reward) which most on who are on the outside world will never understand. However, in the 15 years of service which I have completed, I have seen stress and the inherent responsibility of this job force to retire. Back in 2010 in the span of 3 months 4 co-workers died of heart attacks and none where over the age of 52. Not everyone can handle the pressure, responsibility and stress of this job and a few days ago a coworker who I knew for 15 years committed suicide."
108,Alcoholic father-in-law threatens suicide when family refuses to give him money,"My husband's father, David, is an alcoholic. His father and mother have been estranged for decades, but they get along ok when we spend the holidays together. My husband also has a sister who has two children. We have no children (but are working to save our money so that we can afford to someday)."
109,Enough is enough. It's high time I let go.,5 years of trying to change my career and job. -failed
110,"My cousin is brain-dead, and he will be unplugged","Hi everyone,"
111,I can't take it anymore.,First off I want to warn that I am new to this forum. I read the rules but if i do mistakenly say/do something im not supposed to I apologize in advance.
112,I take no joy in anything anymore.,"Hi Everyone,"
113,Just been on my mind,I will start off with I am not trying to hurt myself.
114,I dont know what to do.,"I like this girl very much, and she knew it, yet she was my closest friend, we used to roam together, dinners, movies and all that."
115,"Cant get over ex, im in a very bad place","Hey all,"
116,lying to family about suicide,"For the family of the person who takes his life, it is going to be really hard. My family lives in a different country, and I'm not planning on anything soon, but I was thinking what if I tell them that I have some type of terminal illness so to prepare them for sometime in the next few years. What type of illness could I tell them about? Do you know anyone who has tried this before?"
117,I can no longer think of a reason to live,"I've been suicidal since I was ten, I'm twenty six now and every year gets harder and less fulfilling. I've never got a break from my misery and everything seems to pile on. I have a very hard time seeing any benefit at all from staying alive."
118,suicidal thoughts,"I'm 17 and I've been having suicidal thoughts for quite a long time now. I just don't see anything positive in my life. Sure, I have friends and quite close family but I'm not happy. I cry to sleep almost every night and i never feel good enough for anyone or anything. I can't keep living my life like this. I want to die but I don't know which death is the least painful."
119,Struggling to continue after break up,Its been 2 months since she broke up with me and ive never experienced pain like it . Its all my own fault as i was being needy and insecure and i cant cope with the guilt and regret for acting that way . I love her so much and its all my fault . Ive been crying non stop ever since and struggling to function . Suicidal thoughts have been entering my head as the pains to much to bear . She was my first everything and now shes gone . The thought of her being intimate with other guys is killing me . I want this all to stop . Ive ruined everything and i dont have the strength to continue .
121,One Year Agreement,"One year ago I lost everything, my home, possessions, majority of my ""friends"" and most importantly my fiance. I never cared about a nice life or material things, just my love. When this happened I fell into a deep depression. I have always struggled with depression but this was different. I had made an attempt to take my life but was unsuccessful. Afterwards I sought help from my closest friend. He did everything to help me, as my family did. Nothing changed. I went to therapy, took meds, exercised, and socialized all to no avail. My friend pleaded with me to give it time. ""One year"" he said, ""Please just wait one year. If nothing has changed and you still long for death then I can't stop you."" I loved him too much to deny him this request. It has been a year now, and still I have felt nothing but misery and despair. I never feared death, and have long since come to terms with my end. Now, I want to show my family and friends that I love them and I want them to understand. I don't know what to do, how could anyone ask another to be okay with their passing? I want my memory to be one of love in the end. I don't want to leave them with only pain"
122,Can't see another way out...,"Not sure why I am writing this but guess it feels like there is no other choice and this is kind of my last place to go. I have been building up the courage over the last few months to actually commit myself to suicide, to know for a fact that I can go through with it and now I am here this decision is so final. I do have the capacity to go ahead with it, God I want nothing more than to do it but I know it's selfish and it isn't just me I will be hurting. Just feel everyone would be better off without me in their lives and while it may hurt people for a bit they will soon realise how much better they are without me in it - I am like a disease!"
123,Depressed and suicidal II,it's me again and I need to speak my mind..
124,I am confused right now. Help?,So hello!
125,I'm so tired of being used by men at such a young age ...,"So for as long as I remember I've struggled bad with self esteem, every since I was younger . I use to be chubby during my middle school years and I was insecure about my nose and boys didn't really go for me, when I turned about 15 I lost a lot of weight I went down to 109 lbs and I started to wear different clothes fix my hair different and wear contacts . Guys started to really notice me .. Fast forward to age 17. (Now) I had only had sex with one person I lost my virginity at 15 to a guy I had been with on and off since I was 13 I really loved him but obviously he didn't feel the same because he left me for another girl and that triggered something . My father has never been in my life so I find myself really seeking male attention and idk if that's why... But it started with this guy from work he showed interest in me and kept staring at me , we ended up flirting and one thing led to the next and we end up having sex a few times but of course he used me . Quit his job and never heard from him again , he was 21. So I was bummed I really started to like him but then I downloaded apps to meet people . I ended up talking to this guy and we ended up hanging out he started feeling on me and we smoked and I let him have his way.. But then the next time we hung out he let his friends have their way with me when I kept saying no but they still did what they did anyway it was about 3 of them and a 4th wanted to join I was so afraid and screwed up after this but I still wanted to talk to him for some reason because I just don't know .. I'm ed up. Then I went online again (yeah I know I'm dumb) started talking to more guys I wanted to feel wanted and pretty and never thought I could go out and meet someone since I don't have much friends anymore ... Met a guy my age (17) we hooked up I didn't say no but afterwards I felt like a complete and guess what I never heard from him again but I missed my period and I have a feeling I'm pregnant by this guy . Ik I wouldn't be pregnant by any other guy considering I got my period after I had sex with them. & they used condoms. This guy did not and he ejaculated inside of me ... Anyway I started to talk to this really cool guy he told me all guys weren't the same we had an intellectual conversation about life and love and everything and he wasn't my type AT ALL.. But I really fell for his personality we talked for a few weeks then we hung out . We smoked but we DID not have sex but we did kiss.. The second and third time however I gave in and we had sex. And of course Ik it's my fault it's just I really feel like I'm not pretty and so I let guys have their way because I think maybe they will start to like me .. But this guy turned out to be exactly the same . He told me he wasn't looking for anything serious and he basically just wanted to have sex . It broke my heart because I really thought this guy was different ..nah. I'm down I don't know how to feel I wanna commit suicide and if God is real I wanna feel loved for the first time . I'm just so tired of not being good enough . I was never good enough my family doesn't even like me . I'm an only child btw the only family I have is my mom and my grandma .. And I'm so grateful for them but my self esteem is seriously so ed up. I need some advice I need someone to talk to I'm just so done and over this I wanna end it please help me"
126,seeking advice on suicide!!!,"This is about my partners family. Well here goes. I have a young sister inlaw who has 3 beautiul babies all under the age of 5, my brother inlaw hasnt been there much for her and their babies. She has opened up to me and my family about committing suicide. What help is out there?? Where do i start to help her.??"
127,Suicide!!???,I'm not even sure what to say in this post. Hoping after iv typed out and reread my feelings that I can change but I just don't see anything ever getting better. And it's all my fault.
128,Would love to but need to do the right thing for my son,"I have made some bad choices in my life, and boy am I paying the price."
129,Life can never get better,"OK, not totally personalizing here but I am a good example. I'm a dad in his late 50s. I recently took a pay cut and lower position following redundancy (FMP). I wasn't an ""executive"" but was quite well-known as an expert in my field. Frankly, I was lucky to get any sort of job at all, such is the awful state of the Disunited Kingdom."
131,My birth was a mistake,"I really, really loathe myself with a burning passion. I honestly feel like my existence in this world is a big, big mistake. I was never supposed to be born. Things would've been so much better and easier if i wasn't. I've tried to commit suicide twice - first with an overdose and then by hanging. I was close the second time, but not close enough. I've put my family through hell and I just wish all this would end. I'm exhausted. I've got nothing left in me for this world."
132,The Life of Christopher Allen Brackner,"He was born premature and due to lack of oxygen, he was also the color blue. The doctors said there was a 90% chance he would be born dead or mentally handycapped. After 3 months in the hospital, he was taken home for the first time. The day he came home, his brother hit him over the head with a toy truck. That was a start of many years of physical abuse from his brother."
134,Why are people always so negative about the idea of committing suicide?,"Personally , I think that committing suicide can be in a lot of cases be the most rational and therefore the right thing to do , I mean think about it ? you're gonna die anyway , if you have some definitive evidence that your life is going to either be an awful one or,in the best case scenario,be just a one that's not really that good or interesting , then what's the point of living this sort of life , why not just end it right now and save yourself the effort . And even if you think that this ain't true and that somehow there's hope , then still , this hope that things could get better is just a possibility countered by an almost equal other possibility that things are never really going to be that good. I personally am fond of the idea of killing myself . The only thing stopping me is this stupid and irrational survival instinct we all have as living organisms. If I'm able to defeat it , then I wouldn't even give it a second thought and just do it , just end it right there.People always say that ""it's not worth it"" . I agree with that statement except I think that nothing is really worth living for because it's all really destined to end eventually . If you were able to do or create something that the whole entire earth population would glorify you for , you're still gonna die , the entire human race which you served there is gonna be wiped out too, and all what will be left is nothing , just pure nothing,so what's the point then? I'm not gonna do it , just to be clear , however, if I could I would. .Anyway what do you guys think about this ."
135,Feel like giving up! No point in life,"Anyone ever felt what its like to deal with a sociopath!? One who lies pathologically, cheats, steals, cons, manipulates without a care!? Well I d alt with one for 6 months. From day one he lied to me saying he had been single and wanted to pursue a relationship with me. I later found out he's engaged and had been the entire time!!! All of this was a game to him but I developed genuine feelings for him. Always telling me he loved me and would never hurt me...but he did. He also has a criminal record and a string of broken relationships with women. This has really hurt me to the core and I don't know where to begin to get over it i really want to give up!!!!!! Life is hopeless for me...no light at the end of the tunnel. I have been suffering with this for 4 months!!!! Amazing how someone can destroy you by conning you for their own selfish gain. Whats the point in living?"
136,Thinking about suicide,I hate giving my all to someone then they just step on it like it's nothing. I have my ex who is a sweet guy he just lost in the world he does whatever I like but then threed this other guy who is sweet but then he just wants to be friends. But I'm a take this time to relax. I guess it's not no question I just need to release. But I'm thinking about suicide and my child is not even number one no more. Ending my life formore pain
137,My time is up,"I am married with 2 girls age 17 and 9. My Husband is serial cheat, a lier, he is deceitful in every way, shape and form. Last night we had another argument. My 9 year old was upset and now its my fault. He happy of course becuase he has his cakes and eats it. I have decided this relationship is no good and as I am the one in misery and making everyone else miserable, then I should go. I could move and live somewhere else, but to do what, get a cleaning job and live in a grotty flat, no thanks. I don't know why I didn't think of this before, it was like a flashing light bulb moment but suicide is the best option for me. I would like it to be painless, yes I am a coward. I would just like to take 1 tablet and let it be then end. He will bring the bimbo in my bed quickly after, if he hasn't already I am in no doubt about that. I am staying until after Christmas (not that heartless), but I think before my birthday near the end of Jan. I don't want a funeral, people going here lies a woman who was that crap her family no longer liked her. I think we have insurance so if one of us dies then its paid off, not sure if they paid out on suicidse. Not sure if we got insurance as he controls all the moneyl so I can see who he spends all his money on. I like to be cremated do what ever they want with the ashes. I don't know why people choose their own songs at funerals, its not like you are going to be around to listen to it. I use to think people who commited suicide was selfish, especially the ones who kill their families too. But no, not anymore. I understand. We who decide we are not good enough for this life are not selfish at all. Our, especially mine, departing can only benefit. Husband gets the wife he clearly deserves. Kids get a mum who is not studying at the OU at 43 because she was not good enough at 18. A mum who can cook without the whole house knowing about it. The house who is always clean, dog always walked, get to go to all children's school events instead of going to work to pay the mortgage because he spends all his cash on her. He will have someone he is not embrassed about. Someone he can take to parties, instead of saying"" you can't come you have to study"". He will find someone that when she burns tea, breaks a cup, he won't be thinking ""If I was with so and so this will not be happening"". His new wife will be that great he won't need to have an affair in front of his daughter. His new wife won't be walking on eggs shells thinking I do something wrong he will be thinking I wish I was with her, she won't cringe when the kids argue with each other because she knows he won't he won't be thinking I wish I was with her as my life, family and marriage would be perfect. She won't have to stand next to him in the supermarket while he flirting with other bimbos, telling them that they are better than her. Yes life would be perfect when I am gone."
138,I am a suicide survivor...,Hi everyone!
140,Best way to kill myself?,"I am 23 years old and sometimes i just want to end it. I want to know what's the best way to do it, because i can only choose one, i was thinking about jumping from the top of a building or hang myself, but that last option is probably slow and painful. I think killing myself is the best and definitive solution, and remember that we are just small numbers and stats in this crzy world, and i am almost convinced that nobody will care if i kill myself and people will just carry on with their lives, no need to worry about others being sad about me. Knowing that i am scared because i don't believe too much in religion and i don't know what's on the other side but sometimes a solution is a solution, forever. Don't worry about me guys, i am just another number, an irrelevant number."
141,Courteous Suicide,"Hi - I'm looking for answers on 'Courteous suicide'. Before you jump in and say there is no such thing; suicide is a very complicated topic and it is hard to generalize everyone's situation. I'm not looking for suicide prevention, counseling or other similar help. I have been suicidal for over 30 years and it is just the daily normal. I have medical reasons where I don't feel it is rational to continue to suffer until natural death happens. Yes, I know medical suicide is a highly debated topic but it is not the context of my post."
142,Im definetly going ahead with ending my life,"I've decided I'm doing it Saturday morning, I will take my son and nephew out tomorrow after school for our final day together."
143,I'm not sure what to do,"Hell i dont even know what to say. I just need to talk to someone but theres no one i can talk too. Everyone thinks i have gotten over my suicidalness and depression but i havnt. I've been trying to pretend to be happy because thats what everyone wants me to be. But i'm tired of that and i cant keep this up. The only thing thats kept me motivated is i didnt want to hurt anyone by hurting myself. But i cant keep doing this. Everyday it gets worse and worse and i dont know what to do or who to go too. So now i'm here. I really feel uncomfortable with all of this because i've bottled it up for so long. But i dont want to hurt anyone else, so i need help. I dont know how to keep going on anymore. I've wanted to die since i was 13 and its getting harder and harder to stop myself from carrying it out."
144,Advise,My girlfriends younger brother passed from suicide and we live together and have been together over 2 years. She needed me there for a week and after it is all said and done she wants to be on a break. We live together and don't even talk or she never comes home. I want to help and I see how much she is hurting and I feel hopeless. We have talked about a future and I no longer thing she wants anything to do with me anymore. I don't know what to do.
145,I want the pain to be over,"I posted in the breaking up section about the difficult breakup that I'm going through, under difficult break up."
146,Sick of not knowing what love is.,"Hi this is going to be long, I feel."
147,Really felt like doing it,"About 2/3 weeks ago, I really felt like doing it. I was physically, as well as emotionally, low and I think one caused the other but I'm not sure what came first."
148,I'm happy but still thinking about it,"Okay, so i'm happy. Just moved interstate, made new friends who are great and on the path of going to University."
149,Suicide is on the mind.,"I am in this marriage where I love him more than my next breath but he HATES me. I do not know how I can live apart from him, to see him happy with someone else, to loose my in-laws. I love them more than most of my family. We have been married 15 years. He is my life. I am selfish and my pride will be the death of me."
150,Idk how much longer I have in me,I have thought about suicide nearly every day since the age of 14. I'm sure I have BPD and I'm a male but all the therapist and psychiatrists are too scared to give me the diagnosis. I have an identical twin brother who now for the past year has completely forgotten about me and only thinks about the girl. The only time I was happy without drugs since the age of 14 was when I was in a relationship with a girl whom I loved but eventually left me cause of my instability. I then turned from a pothead to a hard core drug addict and dealer and I'm now a convicted felon at the age of 18. I know everyone in my family would get over my death within a year or two. I thought college was my second chance to meet friends or a girl but everyone this year has so far rejected me. I've been to 4 rehabs many therapist counselors I'm on a load of pharmaceutical drugs to help my depression and anxiety. I'm thinking I'm going to overdose on heroin soon. I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel. Everyone has used me or left me as if I was nothing. I just want peace and I know I will have it once I overdose. And btw I am no longer addicted to hard drugs I haven't been for over a year since my arrest. A heroin overdose just seems perfect to me. I lived by drugs and I will die by the drugs
151,I think about this all the time now,"I have had a very rough 6 months. First the only woman I ever gave my heart to dumps me by text and goes to my cousin who also works with us. I tried doing everything possible to help me get through this but nothing is working. I cry my eyes out everyday, I throw up before going to work quite often. I can't laugh anymore, I put on a fake smile at work. I been researching suicide near death experiences to see what could await me. I see a therapist weekly but it doesn't seem to be helping. My family just tells me to just get over it but I can't. One brother actually wants to beat the crap out of me thinking that's what I need, my mom actually supports this. I'm at my wits end, actually considering going through with it. Not sure what else can help me."
152,Pessimism,"I'm not sure whether this is the right forum but as someone who has had suicidal thoughts at times and fought and still am fighting depression, maybe some of you can relate to this."
153,Longing for nonexistence,"I'd like to start by saying that there is no sob story here. I wasn't raped or abused as a kid. I have a job i don't loathe. I have a car, I'm not addicted to anything. My parents are mostly supportive and loving. I haven't had some girlfriend leave me in a traumatic way. My life is far from perfect but it's a hell of a lot better than a lot of other people's lives. Some people have had all that happen and still live their life every day with a get up and go attitude."
154,Suicidal ex This is extremely hard on me I don't know what to do,ex i was trying to go no contact with messaged me and he is suicidal about her cheating i tried talking to him but he doesn't want help should i talk to his family
156,Carbon Monoxide Suicide,Hi there and thank you for any help. I have been researching how to execute the method of carbon monoxide suicide. I was planning on purchasing a tank and mask and doing this in my car. I have done a lot of research but what I have yet to find is how to purchase the tanks? It seems as though online it is difficult to purchase - if you have a link please let me know. I found a store in my local area that sells it (some gas/air store that sells various tanks) but does anyone know if I need a license of some sort? (I live in Canada in Ontario) Also what is a common use for it so I can have some sort of backup plan and knowledge so they don't click into what I am actually planning to do?
157,27 y.o Male Virgin - Feeling very despondent,This entire year has been very hard on me. I have been dealing with some pretty bad depression and anxiety which I believe has been going on since I was a child. Ever since adolescence I adopted alcohol as a way to cope. I had my first drink at 11 years old. Since I graduated College and came home to live with my parents at 23 things spiraled out of control and I developed a serious heavy drinking problem on a daily level for 3 years. I ended up going to detox twice and finally sobered up about a year and a half ago. All of this probably in the end made my depression and anxiety worse (both were never officially diagnosed because I never went to a specialist for it). I was also an overweight kid and growing up learned how to control my weight but struggled to keep a normal weight and often gained and lost throughout my teenage years between partying and athletics. This 3 years of heavy drinking caused me to gain enough weight to reach 430 pounds. I have lost 110 pounds of this weight in the past year and a half and I am not to my goal yet... and am absolutely exhausted and discouraged. Ill probably need a tummy tuck eventually to get rid of extra skin unless I see how it rebounds at a very low weight.
158,I Feel Like Suicide's Inevitable. How Not to Hurt Family and Friends?,"I don't think I'm going to last much longer. I've written letters to my roommates, parents, and a friend I've alienated letting them know that it isn't their fault, and that there was nothing they could have done to have prevented it. I know they're going to feel hurt and betrayed regardless, but I'm trying to make it as clear as possible that they're not responsible in any way. I don't know if there's anything else I can do to make it easier for them. I really don't want anyone I care about thinking that they could have done more, because they honestly couldn't have."
159,I want the pain to go away,"I am a American graduate student right now. I should be happy right? No. I've been depressed since middle school, I have a loving mother but no-one else, no friends, I spend most of my time alone in my apartment. I don't get along with my siblings due to their belief that I am gay and a weirdo because I am shy. After the fight we had tonight i am convinced that they are going to have me arrested or institutionalised (I said some vitriolic things that I regret) I hate life; I've been stressed out due to the work load, which compared to undergrad is much more daunting than I had believed. Some days I wake up in the morning and just feel hopeless. I do not care about anything, tried buying things to alleviate my depression (I maxed out two credit cards) to buy video games I havent even played, two new computers, and clothes but nothing. Honestly, I just want my pain to end. I bought a twin pack which contained 196 tablets and taken 49 of them at different times, but they only make me dizzy and my fingers to shake violently."
160,I'm losing control of myself,How do I get it back?
161,I never thought I would post here,I can't take any more.
162,Having suicidal thoughts and feeling completely apathetic about everything.,"Hi everyone,"
164,Trying to Support Suicidal Ex and Feeling like I'm being pulled under,"I really don't know what to do anymore. A few months ago I had my ex committed because he was making imminent threats of suicide. Since then I have tried to be there as a support, but whenever anything goes wrong for him it sets off all kinds of suicidal thoughts for him. It's so scary to hear them and sad to hear the hopelessness. In the past few weeks I feel like I am starting to lose my ability to cope. I feel very depressed now and hopeless in my own way (that this situation will ever change). I'm so scared of losing him and so sad that this is all happening. I really don't know what to do. He is seeing a doctor/counselor. I am also seeing a counselor. None of that is fixing the problem. All I do anymore is worry, all the time. Any advice would be very welcome."
165,I cant .... I cant go on,"I cant do this any longer. I cant live with the pain. I cant live with the loneliness, Im on my knees .. i can no longer get up. Im the one every one turns too for laughs, for help, for support... Im the one every body is glad im there for them. Im the one that is there to provide for people, women.. they love me around them.. they come to me for emotional support, financial support.. tell me im the sweetest, greatest man they have ever known. How all women dream of a guy like me and how i treat them... as they walk away to be with someone else after i am there for everything for them.. im the one alone, im the one that wakes up alone, im the third wheel... i cant do it any more. I have been lied too, cheated on and used in every single relationship I have had.. Some of them were out right cruel to me.."
166,For anyone thinking of suicide please read,I wanted to post this thread for anyone who has or has had suicidal thoughts. It may seem as though I'm rambling on throughout this and I'm sorry if I offend anyone but I feel like its important to tell my story and hopefully help anyone in some way.
167,I need a lie.... anyone got one?,"4 days ago, I had to put my dog down. She was old and had trouble walking and things. It was her time. I was sad. I cried. And yet it felt strangely good. For the past 4 days, I have been feeling sad, but good."
168,i really need to kill myself,can you tell me easiest way?
169,There is something fundamentaly wrong with me,"I don't know, i feel guilty just by writing this, i should not feel depressed, i should not feel suicidal, i have a son, a have brothers and sisters that love me and support me, and I love them all…"
170,I'm so sorry . I can relate to your pain. I'm in a terrible situation with work.,"I can't cope anymore. I hate how I wasted my life. I hate how all the doors are closed to me. I HATE my job. I hate how I can't even have one dream come true. I hate how my career path is non-existent. I'm SO SICK of teaching. I'm SO SICK of the wrong choices I made years ago chosing my major. I hate how F_____UP my life is. I CAN'T cope with reality. I want to end my life and I even can't do that. My life has always been like this and will always be unless I end it and blow this stupid brain of mine out. I'm incapable of going on, keeping going. I want to disappear. I really do. End this constant frustration. End the feeling of constant sorrow. End the constant disappointment. This horrible feeling of wasting my life and not being able to achieve any of my goals. How I wish I could just END IT!!!"
171,my two friends may be suicidal,I'll keep this as brief as I can...
173,Im lost,"I dont really know what to say, so I guess I'll start with a little bit about myself and the reasons im seeking advice on ending it."
174,Gonna kill myself because I hate the idea of being a 25 year old virgin,"I feel like I should probably like, talk to people about it before I do it though. So I dunno, any questions?"
175,Thinking about killing myself,"So I started having unwanted OCD thoughts about six months ago. These would be things such as hurting others, sexual desires, you know all that stuff. So I asked my father what to do and he said I should try acting the compulsions on myself to see what it would feel like. I guess he was thinking I would stop because of the punishment it would bring, but it didn't. So I every time I had the thought, I started to cut myself and tell myself that I'm a horrible person. I really don't blame my father, since none of knew what OCD was at the time."
176,am i in a satanic film? am i dreaming? or am i already dead?,"excatly 2 years ago I got in a bad car accident myself but survived, obviously."
177,Is there anyway to bring a person back from the brink of suicide?,"I've been suicidal quite a few times, recently earlier this year after a devastating loss, and it's something I've struggled with far too much. Speaking perfectly honest, I get this pang of fear whenever I read the post here on ENA about a person on the brink of doing just that. I don't judge and I do understand the appeal of wanting all the loneliness and fear and pain to go away...but it cuts me deeply when I realize that some people are suffering alone and have been for so long."
178,Is there really any point in living anymore?,"I just don't see what I have going for me, I am unemployed and no matter how hard I try to get a job I cannot manage to get one. I have no experience and I have poor social skills, so that doesn't really help when I go into a job interview. All I want at this point in my life is to live on my own and go to college to seek a career path that's worthwhile, and it doesn't seem like that's ever going to happen. I'm below average in intelligence and the majority of my friends are online, which is just pathetic for someone my age. I've never had a real boyfriend or anything like that either, I feel like I missed out on a lot in my teenage years and I'm never going to get them back, and given how poor my social skills are I doubt my late teens and my twenties are going to be any better. I feel like I'm doomed to live my life as a single unwed person who's going to have to live off of welfare, and if that's the case I would rather be dead. It doesn't feel like life is worth living anymore, I don't really get any enjoyment out of it. I just don't know what to do, I feel like I can't really alter or make my situation any better either. I'm 18 years old, turning 19 soon and I have nothing to show for the years I've been alive ."
180,My Girlfriend Tried to commit suicide,"So I've been dating this girl for almost 3 years now. We met when we were 16 (now 19) and up until recently our relationship has been great. However, about a month ago she was at a party which I wasn't at and she was raped by two guys. She didn't tell me at first (she told me she got away originally) but about a week after she told me what really happened. I went with her and had her tested for pregnancy and stds and luckily she was all clear. It was really hard on her but she was doing really well. When we were together she seemed almost normal. When we talked on the phone or texted she was upbeat and there weren't any worrying signs."
181,Does it ever change...,"I'm scared its never going to change. I'm scared I'm always going to feel like this....since I can remember I've always been the happy go lucky clown that cheers everyone up,I'll be 24 this month. I'm always there for everyone and always willing to lend my time money effort anything....I've tried probably 7 different anti depression medications and it doesn't work...I took two recently And I honestly think the side effects made me the way I am and I can't stop thinking about ending my life...I feel like I'm just not good enough like I can't do anything right except when I'm at work...my job keeps me focused and I do a lot of overtime and by a lot it's nothing for me to do 18 hour shifts each day. My job is a pretty negative atmosphere but it's a job I've always wanted to do, so it's complicated I feel that has added to my issues. I honestly have no idea what I'm doing anymore I feel like I'm just here and holding on by a thread.....about a month ago I had wrote down some things I was feeling I had a lot to drink and was planning on taking some pills...I passed out and woke up to wha I had wrote and just broke down. There's a guy I work with he says all ppl that commit suicide are cowards and it pissed me off cause I've never thought of myself as a coward idk honestly what's up and what's down anymore....I know I need help but psychologist and the counsers I've talked to in the past just don't seem to help and make me feel better....idk what to do..."
183,I'm having thoughts,I broke up with my girlfriend I have had for 2 years. I broke up with her 2 days ago. The reason was it le because it's what I thought she wanted because she said she didn't love me like that anymore.
184,Today,Was my birthday and no one knew or cared.
185,The scariest feeling ever..,"So yesterday I decided it was time, I've been suicidal since I was 16 and I just felt like enough was enough. So I tied my dogs leash around my neck and the other half to the banaster of my loft. I cushioned the rope and made sure the noose was on the right side to block my carotid artery. After a few attempts of trying to do it I just kept sobbing and pulling myself back up (I was doing it sitting) when finally I just let my whole body go. I felt the air leaving my brain, I saw flashing lights, next thing I know I wake up in a panic with the rope still strangling me. It was the scariest moment of my life, I didn't even remember what I was doing I felt so out of it. I kept panicking to breathe and prying at the rope because I did not want to suffocate awake. I finally got it off and just sat there bawling for hours. None of my family or friends understand, I feel so stupid.."
186,How do you fight off unwanted suicidal thoughts?,For anybody who has experience with this how do you fight them off?? As hard as I try I still have thoughts of just taking a knife and running it accross my throat or taking a whole bottle of some unknown pills(sorry I know that was graphic but that's how I feel most of the time). So you do you do it? I'm proud that I haven't attempted suicide in over a year and I haven't hurt myself in months but I know that one day I'll relapse
188,I guess this is my goodbye....:(,"I've made up my mind. This is a final goodbye, I cannot let anyone talk me out of this. This is why I am writing on a forum, so I can let it all out before I go. Im going to do this tonight. I am sitting at work right now, anxiously waiting on this evening to arrive. I have been battling severe clinical depression since April of 2014. Here I am, a year and 3 months later, and the depression has won. I can no longer deal with the pain anymore. I am so hurt. I want it all to go away. I am not looking for anyone to talk me out of this, I really just want it to end. And tonight, it will."
190,not sure what else to do,"my boyfriend of 3 years broke up with me a week ago, then he came to see me last night and said he wanted to make things work, now he's saying he's not sure and that he doesn't think it will work and he doesn't want to be with me but he'll still try"
191,Why not to commit suicide?,"I m thinking of committing suicide but I m not absolutely sure if it's worth the time. I have no children nor someone who depends on me, so my absence will not harm anybody, except maybe for my mother but it will harm her only emotionally. She is the only reason i dont want to do it yet. No friends, no other family members will cry for more than 2-3 days."
192,Maybe I'm done,"Maybe I'm done with life. Maybe I'm just done. I have nothing more to give. I have tried my best in most endeavors and now I'm just tired. I feel it's time to sleep. It's time for peace. I'm depleted and exhausted. Sometimes at bed time I pray I will just fall asleep and not wake up. Not because it's all hopeless or I am helpless, but because.... I'm done.... And I have nothing left to give. I can not give what I do not have....so maybe it's just time to sleep."
194,Why am I so weak?,I have opened and closed my knife so many times tonight. The tip ready to slide into my flesh bleeding me to any place other than here. My gun is loaded and ready to just have the trigger pulled. Pills on the counter ready to go. I have enough paracord tied into nooses I have my choice of color. Yet as I sit here typing I can't do it. My body seems to say I have enough to live for but all I see is a totally wasted life. I tried hard to change to better my life and yet all I have done is make it worse. Sleep is pointless because it is just nightmares of what my life is or taunts of what life never will be.
195,What to do and when to do it.,I have two question.
197,"my life makes no sense i'm afraid, i want to die","i hope my story won't be too long, sorry if my english isn't perfect but i'm italian, i'm a 20 year old girl and i want to die, 4 years ago when i was still in high school my parents broke up, my father used to live in u.s.a because of his job, one day he lost his job and decided to return here in italy to me and my mother(the two of us used to live alone) and he brought a woman who was much younger than him at our house saying she was a friend he wanted to help, we trusted him because he says she was going to stay with us just for a bit to find a university where she could study, in the end we found out she was a prostitute and he was ing her in our house (mine and my mothers), my mother became depressed and anorexic but there was nothing we could do since my mother didn't have a job, so we depended on my father, we had to live with them for a long time and we found out he met her in a voodoo religious cult, in the end my father decided to return in the u.s.a with this woman( after many many fights in my house). i was very depressed, in the meantime i was bullied at school terribly by 3 boys, they used to beat me up and humiliate me, i was too afraid to tell someone and the people i told didn't really believe me, i couldn't take it anymore i started becoming a very anxious person i injured myself and an obsessive- compulsive disorder, i then decided to stop going to school completely because of the terrible bulling ( they ripped the pages of my books and diary, beat me up when the teachers weren't in the classroom ,make fun of me and sexually harassing me) at that time we had many many debts to pay, me and my mother were alone when my father left and we didn't have any electicity (since we couldn't pay it) so we used candles and had cold showers till the removed water from our house so we couldn't use the bathroom or anything, my mother found a very hard job where she worked desperatly to earn something for the two of us, she had to clean in a big hotel in summer and wasn't paid very much, in the end of summer she could finally save some money to leave my old house and find a new cheap house to live in, but when we found one we discovered that the agency that was offering us the house was a scam, so they stole us 1000 euro, we called the police but they dissapeared, in the end we didn't have any house and we were desperate, i had to return to school but didn't have a place to live in, maybe because of a miracle we found a little place to stay that wasn't too expensive i returned to school but the bulling continued and i didn't want to go to school anymore i was absent for awhile till the school called my mother saying i wasn't going to pass that year, i then found the courage to talk about the bulling episodes to one of my teachers she believed me she sayd she was going to talk about it to other teachers, when she did she told me that the teachers dint't care that i have to leave my personal problems in the house and just continue studying, all the teachers started saying bad things about the teacher who wanted to help me so she became depressed and retired, i never saw her again, i was so sayd i didn't have any faith in people anymore, my only school friend started bulling me too, so the next year i decided to stop going to school and study privatly, i studied on my own but it was hard and that year i had a very big form of depression i tried suicide once but failed, so studing became harder and harder for me, the final day i had to show up for my final year exam (after studing on my own) i failed the test, i couldn't take it anymore, people started criticizing me, saying i was lazy and i din't want to study , that i just wanted to goof around all day , but that wasn't the case i used to really love studing but the bulling was too much, i was so insecure i was afraind they would beat me up again, it hurted so much i felt like like an object people could use, i was like a toy to my bullies i felt violated, but people couldn't understand me they just judged me, i then found the courage to look for a job but they all told me i lack experience and since i have so many economic problems i can't afford to buy myself a car or have driving license lessons( they are very expensive here) so nobody ever wanted me for a job, all my friends have parents with lots of money so they can do all they want to do, they started expensive schools have their car, they do expensive courses, i can't do anything, i'm depressed i fear people i'm anxious and i don't have friends, i have only one friend that only wants to see me when she's lonely but when i meet her it's like i'm invisible to her, and we don't have anything in common anymore, when i look at society i fear it, people all look evil and egoistic to me, i have only my boyfriend who i really love, he is so nice and kind, i would really like to be strong for him but i feel so sad, i always cry myself to bed, he has a job so even if wants to stay with me always he can't, so i'm lonely all days, i tried volounteering in a place where they offered italian lesson to foreigners from poor countries so i could feel better helping people,and find hope and trust, but one of the students was a creep, he was an aggressive man and always asked me weird things and personal stuff, so i left, i'm really sad i'd love to find kind and good people like my boyfriend, i hate our society they only base everything on superficial stuff, nobody has a heart anymore, they only think about themselfs, people only think about sex, looks, alcohol, they aren't faithfull to their loved ones, they lie without feeling shame, they betray friends, it's like humanity is ed up, i'm becoming crazy .. i think the world is too cruel i don't have the strenght to go on, i feal so weak i cry at all the horrible things i hear on the news, i cry at all the horrible things people say, i feel this hatred towards everything, i wanted to find a job and have a family with the boy i love, but i fear the world, i don't have possibilities.. i want to end it..oh and i've seen a therapist but she didn't help at all she just made me feel worst.. what can i do please help me, what can make me have faith in humanity again..is it really so cruel?"
198,Just tired....,I don't want to kill myself. I've already been there done that and know that I'm not going anywhere until it's my time to. I am just so tired of living. I'm so tired of life. I want to just go to sleep and not wake up. I have battled this for years upon years. I know what all I have to live for and I know that suicide is not the answer but it's such a nice thought. Just take the easy way out and be done. I just wanna go home.
199,You are not alone,"I know there are many reasons one might consider suicide: terminal illness, incurable physical pain, crippling debt, you lost someone you don't think you can live without, etc. I understand these reasons. But, if one of your reasons for considering suicide is because you feel alone and nobody loves you or cares about you, please take the time to read this post in it's entirety."
200,im trapped in a nightmare and i cant wake up,"hi,"
201,the final nail in the coffin,"I have been suffering from some pretty severe depression an anxiety. My school career has fought me since the beginning, and my social circle is non existent. I have worked retail for six long years. I am a tired individual."
202,My children need a better mother.,"I love my little ones more than anything in this universe. I want to give them everything. I have shown them compassion, protection, and nurturing. But I feel like I have let them down."
203,Best way to kill yourself? I'm fairly set on doing it and don't want to fail..,"Hello everyone.. I know we don't know each other but I'd like to take a moment to explain my situation to you, and then seek your assistance in what my course of action should be. I know this is going to be a huge wall of text, but I only ask that you take into SERIOUS consideration what I am going through, and subsequently advise accordingly, objectively and based on what you would do in the same shoes as me."
204,what's something in life,"I'm not here to share a long drawn out story. I want to know, what in life is here and why it is worth while even in the face of daily physical and mental pain. Thank you."
205,Theres no point in me living,"I'm a twenty year old guy and I've had depression for several years now. Picked it up in high school and pretty much have had it since, getting worse and better every now and again. I don't have any talents or skills, and the only enjoyment I have in life is being around my dad. We haven't always gotten along, but he's not in very good health now and I love him. My dads side of the family has weak hearts and he's not well at the moment. I'm not strong enough to stand on my own two feet in this world. If I ever can't handle things I ask him to help me. I don't really mean financially, but he's always helped me with my problems and I won't be able to keep going when he passes away. I'm probably going to go to the hardware store about the middle of this week and buy myself a bit of rope and make myself a noose. When he passes away I don't think I'll be able to keep myself from driving out to the local bush and hanging myself off a tree."
206,I don't know...,Hey guys I don't know fully know why I'm posting this... I'm not going to kill myself. But I just feel like people would be so much happier if I wasn't around.
207,"Not sure why I am posting this, I suppose I just wish to share.","It's been a long time since I found this site and posted here, here I am years later and unfortunately not much has changed. I just drank about a quarter bottle of Rivotril. Read that overdosing on that would make you pass out, slow your heartrate down and also your breathing and then kill you. Right now I am waiting for it to happen."
208,Would you check out in this scenerio?,"I am struggling to find reason to want to live - I don't want to die - but I don't want to live right now (if this makes sense). I lost the only person I ever loved a few months ago (my mom). I am not close to my family, they have never been there for us - I never married, nor did I have children. I have some friends that I am fond of, but no ""best"" friend. I am getting old (seriously, at 50, I am probably the oldest person on ENA). I have always had a job, but no real career. I no longer choose to date since all I was meeting were criminals and I have not had a boyfriend in years. I tried church but just don't feel the Spirit, and I can't force it."
209,"Wish I could just end it all, but I have a son.",I'm not really sure what the point of this post is because I have no intentions of actually killing myself. I just can't believe that I'm even thinking about doing it.
210,Am I doomed to suffer for life?,"I don't know how to begin this and I've put it off for a really long time. I guess my life changed after a girl used me and cheated on me. I started having anxiety attacks, panic attack, depression. I thought the anxiety feeling..constant headache that never goes away, feeling tired all the time would go away after sometime but it's been more than 2 years now and It's still stronger than ever. I turned into an emotional wreck and I now have low self-esteem and no self-confidence."
211,My future seems none existent.,"I feel empty. Like no matter how good i feel theres a pit in my stomach that swallows my feelings in seconds. I have dealt with depression since I was 8, I used to bite and scratch so i could feel something. I don´t feel depressed anymore. I just feel pointless. I want to die but then again I don´t. I sit and think about how good it used to feel when i slit my arms open I stopped just over a year ago. I feel no connection with my past and I feel like I have no future I feel like if I ended it life for everyone around me would be better."
212,I dont want to become suicidal but I see no way to stop this downward spiral,"I feel like my life is doomed to spin out of control in a downward spiral, and I'm afraid to see where it's going to lead. I see no way it can get better, despite my efforts. Are some people just doomed to be a failure at life even though they never stop trying? When does it get better? I'm in my 40's and things are just going backwards, not forwards."
214,Been thinking about it every day for a month now.,I've attempted to write a letter but I gave up because it doesn't matter anyway. I've made a plan on how to do it. Making sure that it'll work.
215,"I think, I'm on the edge","I'm a type of person who always pushes as hard as possible to succeed. I keep myself busy constantly with school and I spend a lot of time writing short stories and going out doing photography. I try to keep myself detached from negative environments but I always keep being pulled in, yet I manage to keep myself well.But I think I'm finally breaking down after all these years, it feels like I'm just falling. I'm scared because, I don't eat like I used to anymore I loved food, I always got super excited trying new things but now its gone, that excitement. I feel dead inside now too, like nothing phases me anymore and it scares me because I feel like an empty shell. I have no inspiration for writing or photography anymore and I fear because of that I'll fail my classes. I live in an apartment with a engaged couple that constantly insult my friends infront of me and insult me behind my back when all I ever did was defend them and even did their photography for their website and invites. I never have any money anymore so sometimes I don't really eat much to begin with because I can't afford it, I miss my mom and dad a lot but I cant bring myself to say it. I can't bring myself to tell my friends that I love them anymore, I've drifted away from many of them and I ignore a lot of them. I don't go out anymore, and I always turn down every invite I get to go out I just lay down in my bed and lock my door so I don't have to listen to my roommates making out with each other."
216,Stressed to the point of committing suicide,Hello all! I'm so desperate for help right now.
217,Depression at its finest: Financial Issues,"Ive been battling with depression for the past 7 years and it doesnt seem to be getting better. It started as a preteen when my mom and I had moved for the first time. I went to a school where it was mostly white and the kids there didnt make my experience a good one. Ever since my first encounter with ignorance, my haterd for people has escalated. However, I am a very funny and loving person with a lot of friends. I was always the popular girl in every situation, how ironic. Anyways, after i graduated high school i thought my life was finally gonna take off and i was finally gonna be happy with the life i thought i wouldnt get the chance to live. Unfortunetly, due to me not having a car at the time and my college was in a different town, i was forced to live with my father. My father is a mean and horrible person. He is a womanizer, a player and everything else you wouldnt want your daughter me to meet in a man. Yea.... i was forced to live with that if i wanted to start college. Long story short, he ended up starving me and bringing the girls he had picked up, around my living spaces. This started to bring back the depression i thought i had graduated from in HIgh school. Every second i was getting blamed for something petty and focusing on school became too much of a task. I tried talking to me mom about the situation and she just couldnt understand or probably didnt want to about what i was dealing with. I talked to my siblings about it and they helped because they all hate him too but it wasnt enough to get me through the day."

219,Help my girlfriend talking about suicide,Help my long distance girlfriend is scaring me she's saying there's no point for her to be here anymore and I need help talking to her she's a very closed person and has really ever opened up to me about her past please help!
220,Something has to be wrong with me o__o,"My brother awhile back tried to kill himself and tbh I didnt even rlly care....I was there when he had the gun and I just sat there playing on my laptop I know I should of been crying and sadness but Idek anymore, The worst thought I had that day was when My dad told my other brother that hes being a P***y and I thought he was being one for not taking the chance he had...."
221,I'm feeling lost and embarassed and running out of coping skills,"I broke up with my ex in November of 2014 - posted about it awhile back. I loved him so much - but I felt so taken for granted, that I was so low on his priority list. Our relationship went by his rules - his rules on when / if we saw each other, how we behaved when, he rationalized everything so I couldn't argue, he seemed so logical that I COULDN'T - I wish I didn't see it sooner. Once, when we argued, and I, crying, told him I wasn't a ""yeller"" during fights, he told me he knew that, and I wouldn't be with him if I was. It made me worry that if I raised my voice he'd leave, even though that's not my personality, anyway. We were together for three years, and made some great memories, but the feeling of being generally unimportant on an everyday basis just hurt too much. I got tired of crying and feeling so bad for wanting or asking for something. And when he didn't like what I had to say, I'd get the silent treatment until he cooled down, which just made me feel guilty. The worst was four days of it; I didn't understand why, if you loved someone, and knew they were upset, why you would let them feel that way for days and days."
222,My sister is depressed and I don't know how to help her,"Mods- I'm not sure if this is the right subforum, so please move if necessary."
224,enlightened minds-suicide,"i do not connect with people. and by that, i mean i dont even think that i want to. i am not only disgusted by what the human race has become, but am mortified by the fact that if i stay on this earth, i may become like them. Personally, the people in which i respect are the ones experiencing suicide and self-harm themselves, because they KNOW. their minds are open to everything. they are so much more in touch with reality than everyone else. in my opinion, once you have experienced that, you have found true enlightenment, and therefore are ready to take your life. i am ready to take my own."
225,Sorry please help! recurrent episodes,Sorry I feel like I litter this forum with my pathetic problems. But its just so helpful.
226,I think my friend/ pen pal might have killed themself?? I need some advice!,"I have had a pen pal from Denmark for a few years. And we usually chat at least a little bit pretty much everyday. We know each other pretty well, the problem is, I don't know his real friends or family. So I went on vacation at the end of October and I got back on November 7, and I wasn't able to chat with him while I was gone. When I went to go message him, his last message was on November 3rd, and he said ""man I miss your words"" With a smiley face. So I messaged him back telling him about my trip etc. I still haven't heard from him and now it's the 16th. He's told me before that he has felt suicidal multiple times throughout his life, so I'm panicking after it now being almost two weeks since his last message. I have his facebook, nobody has posted on his wall or anything, I would think one of his friends would have said something on facebook, but nothing I can see. I've also noticed like 2 or 3 of his friends have deleted him in the past few days, that really scares me. And the part that scares me the most is, I found his job profile online, and it says worked here ""November 2013, till October 2014"" That freaked me out! Does anyone know what I should do? I just want to know if he's okay or not. Should I message one of his friends even if I don't know them? What should I say without sounding weird? I tried calling his phone once and got no answer. I feel really awful right now, because I feel like if I had gotten home just a few days sooner I could have helped him. And I can't really think of any other reasons of why he just disappeared. And all the little things I'm finding look really bad, like not working at his job anymore, and people deleting him on facebook etc. Do you think people deleted him because he killed himself? I just feel terrible right now, and don't know what to do. And it's hard because he's so far away. I appreciate any advice! Thanks!"
227,Not dead.... Lil update and apology..,"Hey everyone, just thought I'd make this thread to inform everyone who was involved with my last thread that I am not dead, Lol..."
228,Something that helps me...,"Over the past several months, I have felt increasingly suicidal from time to time. Med issues, working on stuff, etc. I do feel the urge every once in a while to kill myself. Sometimes I go through ""plans"" in my head, or thinking about what I'd put in a letter. If it gets bad enough, I leave my apartment so I don't have to be around sharp things. Will it get better? Sure hope so, working on it, work in progress."
229,Ex Girlfriend Threatened Suicide and now in Hospital after I called 911,Hi I've never commented on one of these but I really hope I can get some feedback.
230,It's time,I want it to end.
231,What am I living for????,"Hi, I'm feeling really down and really want to let these things out. I don't think I could ever kill myself but have been having the ¨what am I living for feeling”. I feel like I've reached the climax in my life. I've had friends, mainly from things I've been a part of... Work, youth group, game groups etc... I survived on my own for 3 years. Well I rented a room, but was very independent. Never been in a realtionship, really have no desire for it anymore. Use to live near San Fransisco and did many fun things there. One of the highlights was seeing Lion King on Broadway. I got to hangout with a guy who was a lot like a guy I'd want to be with. We stoped talking but I honesly don't feel like I'll never meet someone like that again. A little about me... I'm 23 years old am homosexual and have aspergers syndrome. If you remember Elliot Rodger the guy who mudered 6 people a few months ago. He also had aspergers syndome. While I would NEVER kill anyone, I watched some of his youtube videos and really realted to when he talked about being alone and living for just living for the beauty of nice scenary such as a golf couse that he was at. One big difference between us is the subject of love. He had strong desires for love and sex, and was so upset that he couldn't get a girlfriend, and that no girls wanted him. While I've know quite a few guys who have wanted to be with me, but I don't really have the desire for love or sex anymore. One thing I'm very greatful for is my looks. People say I look like Michael Phelps or Andrew Luck. I am a lil smaller than them, I weigh about 160. I have a high motablisim, and am very active, but still look pretty good. I have so many flaws, that a least I can feel good about something. I have a lil speach problem so sometimes people can't understand me, my jaws not alinged properly, my ribcage Isn't straight so one part of my chest is bigger than the other... My biggest problem in life is my realtionship with people. I'm very mature for my age. I don't drink, do any sort of drugs, don't hang out with anyone or really have any friends anymore, and like I mentioned before not interested in love. So then I look after everyone else they pretty much are the exact opposite... Most people my age party, drink, maybe do or have tried drugs, they are usually with friends or their realtionship parter, and most people like to have sex. So most of the time I feel like I'm from mars. I don't drive so I'm usually walking everywhere I go so I'm around it all day long. I always have my headphones on, if my ipod dies it sucks. Oh another thing all the judging and geeting made fun of I have to deal with. Worst time was when I was kicked the hell out of by some kids, a few months ago. They actually broke my left arm. Scariest thing that has ever happened to me. Luckily I'm almost all healed, but probably never forget that. Everywhere I go I feel like an outcast, even at the jobs I've had. I kind of think of most people kind of like clones. They may look, talk and act a lil different but mostly everyone likes the same things. The things I mentioned before that I don't do or get involved in. I saw the movie Fight Club with Brad Pitt a few weeks ago, and it made me think of myself. The concept of the movie was doing things different than everyone else. Lol while they did bad things different in the movie, I can realate to living that ""differnent lifestyle”. Lastly I want to talk about my parents, mainly my mother. She helped me a lot in life, homeschooled me from 6 grade till the end. I did all the work but she was there to take my to all my classes to meet with the teachers. Trust me I do love her but our realtionship now is not so good. Like I said earlier, I lived on my own for 3 years, but since I've moved with them to Southern California a few months ago I feel like it was like it was before. They would scream at me, and get me so upset and then I'd just lay in bed and cry and feel so alone. It took me a couple months for my arm to heal, and then last month I stayed home and so I can take care of our dogs. She got back a week and a half ago and is pissed that I haven't found and job yet. Even though I've been going out everyday and looking for one, and even introduce myself to the hiring managers. All she talks about is how she wants me to move out and how I make the house ”toxic”. I try to talk to her, but she only wants to talk about, what SHE wants to talk about. If I talk about something she usually doesn't care. I'll get a short ”oh” or ”good”. I also try to explain to her that I takes time to get a job, and you have to wait from them to call you for an interview, but it goes on ear and out the other. Would love to hear any advice or comments you guys have. Thanks"

236,I'm surprised I'm writing this...,"I'm back at this crossroads. I have been contemplating for a long while now, have for a couple years but for some reason now seems right. Why do I feel this way? Oh, I guess I've thought this way since I was a pre-teen, then because of my dad and now just not feeling...like I have much of a purpose or significance. I really need help but I can't risk it for work. Just turned 25, celebrating my 2nd year of marriage this week, and for some reason I am horribly depressed when no one is around. I try to force myself around people to stop the thoughts or action of, but even when there is 10 seconds of silence it's pacing in my mind. I don't know whats wrong with me, I need some professional help."
237,I almost put a shotgun to my head today,about 2 hours ago my friend and I went into the woods and where shooting a shotgun. I never used a gun before this and sure it was fun but the whole time I was thinking about putting it to my head and pulling the trigger. The only thing that stopped me is I never wanted to put my friend through that it was his gun and his idea to go out there and i never wanted him to blame himself for it. But if i was by myself i wouldn't be writing this right now.

240,I want to drink Anti-Freeze because I deserve to die a painful death,"I am a horrible, terrible person. My ex-wife hates me, and she has good reason to. I was a terrible, abusive husband to her.

243,"Suicidal gf, do not love her as I did, will kill herself if I leave her+ more","From what to start... I am dating one girl for almost half a year now, we never really get along, but we managed to go on, about 2 months back she had to go to other town (we were already living far apart, but now even more), we still were talking through skype/phone with baying apart she started to get more depressive and started to do self harm, she was doing before but I tried to help her, so she was not doing for all the time until that time ~2 months ago, and she started doing it so badly and something broke into me... I was thinking that I was helping her and it all was just even worse so I started to have my own depression, for last 2 months we argued a lot she even blocked me in skype several times, then gone back next day. I turned really bad too, when I have depression I cant do anything, I cant tell anything, do anything, because of that it went to even larger problems, but then we had bigger argument and we did not talk for 2 or 3 days, then kinda started again, then I found out that one of her ""friends"" will be coming over, the things is that friend was her ex, she did not say me, but she posted it somewhere, so as I saw them talking and clearly she was hitting on him. 2 days after that she started to wrote to me again and later that day she asked if I will love her no matter what, I said ""only thing I would never forgive is cheating"" then after some time same day she told she had sex with her ex, but she resisted and did not want it. The thing is I knew something like that may have happened, because some time back she had one more friend with her who was trying to touch her, but she said no (that is what she told me) even if ""she actually wanted to have sex, but she will wait till we can again""."
245,i want to kill myself. i am not depressed,I am 22 years old for about 4 years now I feel like I have sort of been waiting around to die. I am not depressed nor sad or suffer a mental illness. I spend a lot of time alone and don't really talk too much. I have told someone whom I trusted at one point and they called me crazy and literally never talked to me again. I don't feel crazy. Maybe its not normal to want to kill yourself but what does it feel like to enjoy life? I do love my family but am I being selfish to think such things? I guess the only reason I haven't done it is cause I'm scared of what happens next. I'm not religious I don't believe in god and quite Frankly this universe is so grand and there are so many people right here on earth its hard to believe we are significant at all. I don't know man. Good bye folks
246,I don't know anymore. Pregnant and depressed,"I am currently 29 weeks pregnant. I have suffered depression throughout my pregnancy and well before I found out that my boyfriend of four years and I are expecting our first child. This pregnancy has been incredibly hard on me, it's been very stressful and it is not what I thought pregnancy would be. I am excited to start this new path but I keep having suicidal thoughts, sometimes multiple times a day. I could never kill myself while I have a baby girl growing inside of me; depending on me. I am only 19 years old and I feel like my world is fading away. I live with my mom, I'm unemployed, and probably going to be homeless soon enough because my mom is unable to pay rent. Although my boyfriends mom has offered us her basement as a temporary place to stay, we are not staying there because I don't feel comfortable in doing so because of my past relationship with his mom. His mom has verbally attacked me on several occasions and I do not want her breathing down my neck 24/7. My boyfriend has an amazing career that pays well but it is not enough for three people to live off of. I feel so useless and helpless. Im basically counting down the days until I can comit suicide and not be anyone's burden. I feel like , making my boyfriend pay for my phone bill, food, necessities, ect, none of that is his responsibility but.. I don't know. He probably just feels sorry for me at this point. Without him paying for the things I need, I would starve our child because my mom can barely afford food. She buys a few things such as bread and milk every few weeks, but there's never a meal made inside of our home. Before I was pregnant I was depressed, because of family issues, and life. I felt like there was no point in living, like life is the ultimate joke. What. Is. The. Point? There is none. I can't wait until this pregnancy is over, everyone will be better off without me. I'm a loser."
247,Donating my life,"I feel hopeless, lonely, empty, sad,...I pushed some of the most important people in my life away, I feel ungrateful of life....I know there is people who is in need of organs donation....but what I want to donate is my life, I don't want to live anymore...I'm tired of thinking...I'm tired of life, anyone know where or how I can donated my life?"
248,I don't want to be here anymore,The month of February my boyfriend left me... And ever since then I wake up everyday wanting to die... I don't attempt it but everyday I wake up angry for having to wake up and continue with a life I no longer want and I try everyday to be positive I don't have any family or friends who I can say I trust or I can count of financially im struggling because I'm lazy... I have no thrive or motivation.... I not only lost the man I love but also my best friend and all because of my controlling ways... I try to think that this is not the end of my life and I go to the gym and I tryed going to get ready to start school today but guess what just my en luck I come to register and they stole my car.... Yeah way to have a better life I know other people have it worser than me but at the end of the day I'm still suffering in a life I no longer want to live I just want to die already... They stole the one thing I had my car.... I'm en done I rather not live like this anymore
249,done,"i have 3 kids and am a single mom, I've been very depressed lately, I go to bed crying, I wake up crying, I even get up in the middle in the night to cry, I cry in the shower even, I lost my job, I live with a person who is mentally abusing me, he does not work, everything is on my shoulders, I have family but no one to turn to, no one to speak to, I'm overwhelmed and I'm the only person my kids have, if I killed myself they would be the only ones who would care"
250,Single mom contemplating suicide,"I'm going to try not to write a book here... I'm 26, single mom of 4, ages 8, 4, 4 and 1. 8 year olds dad is a deadbeat; other 3 ' dad is a drug addict and currently incarcerated. I'm currently unemployed, as I quit my job to pursue better income in adult entertainment. Due to worsening anxiety, depression and extreme fatigue I have failed in making much income and we are newly homeless, living with oldest sons paternal grandparents. I have recently obtained an anti - depressant prescription from gp. I guess that's the basics although there's numerous details and traumas I've experienced that I'd love to add. Basically I have decided if I am unable to provide much for them for Christmas, I will attempt suicide via overdose and leaving home to guarantee success via hypothermia. As the time grows nearer, I'm wondering if it makes sense to get help. The only thing is I have no child care in order to go to a psychiatrist/therapist. I've been wondering if I could/should give the kids up to social services until my mind is better and I get a job, house, etc. Basically any route I chose at this point hurts them. I have a hard time caring for their basic needs at this point. I believe besides depression and anxiety, I have bipolar disorder and PTSD (former domestic violence). I don't know where to go, I have no friends and am already burden enough to my family."
251,Suicide or Divorce,"What is not as hard on kids? I am not suicidal but am completely miserable in my marriage; however, the thought of divorce and not being with my kids devastates me. I fear if we get a divorce my wife would take the kids out of state. She is a stay-at-home mom so I am thinking the courts would side with her. Long story short, what would be ""easier"" on my kids:"
252,It Isn't Illegal-My Own Personal Hell,"I should have this down pat for as many times as I have repeated this over the phone with law enforcement, but it hurts all the same every time I have to relive it. In fact, saying it doesn't get any easier and I don't know if it ever will. It shouldn't, and I am forced to live with my stupidity. I've accepted this."
253,Just tired! Help,"What do I do when things just never ever seem to get better? Suicide seems like the only way to get rid of this deep inner pain I feel. I'm rarely happy or when I am something happens to quickly change that. I've felt like a worthless piece of crap for the past 3 years since my ex cheated and left me. everyone that enters my life leaves it so that makes it even worse. I feel like I am being punished and I should not be living in the first place as I don't know what my purpose is. I am existing not living. I don't get to travel and go places, I don't have any friends, only my parents. I'm almost out of hope not sure what to do anymore."
255,3 deaths and I'm the only one left,"Im 30 now, but I am about to take you back to when I was six because that is where life as I knew it, was blasted away from me."
256,I'm contemplating suicide again,"I can't understand the meaning of life. Surely it can't be that we wake up; work pay bills then die. Nobody loves me and I don't think that will change. All I have are lots of people who want to use me. If I disappeared tomorrow nobody would notice or really care. Sure some people would say ""what a waste"" but they would be fine without me. Probably wouldn't even cry. There's more love here on the Internet than in real life. The bills are ever present and overwhelming. There's no escape. There's no real happiness anywhere. To know you mean nothing to anyone is pretty harsh. I used to believe that it was a sin to kill myself but now I don't know that I believe in God so its less of a deterrent. So I'm lying here in bed thinking about killing myself and not feeling as concerned about it as I think I should. Just very dispassionately and logically about mechanisms."
257,Failed attempt.,...
258,Can't build up enough courage to do it,"I've felt depressed and sometimes suicidal since I was about 13 years old. My first real attempt was when I was 18. I took every pill I could find in the house and washed it down with half a bottle of cough syrup. I recall lying in my bed in a bit of a haze, and I must have lost consciousness. I vomited at some point in the night, and the attempt ultimately failed and made me quite sick for the next couple weeks. I've tried several times since then, but there always seems to be some sort of mental block which stops me."
259,Completely lost my way.,I have felt terrible agonizing pain for over a year now. My ex of 81/2 years left last April. He started coming around again a few months ago. I thought there was a chance of reconciliation. Now I know I was a fool to ever believe that. He's gone back to ignoring me. He has completely destroyed me. I just found out a few days ago my dads having an affair. In may I tried to kill myself and the feelings have come back ten fold. I've already started planning it out. I'm tired of feeling like this. I just don't see any other way.
260,"Where do i start ,,,, i am falling and trying to reach out","hello there,,"
261,Overpowering thoughts.,"Recently I cannot help but have thoughts of taking my life, ending my sadness and pain."
262,This is the end,"I'm done, I have given myself three weeks to get ready. I will buy a gun, I have to take out 10 pretty girls with me, there will be 10 less Heartbreakers in this world, and I won't have to go through rejection, heartbreak, being ugly, being the ass anymore. And most of all I won't be ass burden to anyone anymore, especially my family who I already know don't like me. This is my notice. If in three weeks you guys find this note, I need you to give the $6500 I saved up to Gabi. She needs it more than I ever did"
263,People don't see my life as difficult or hard but i don't want to live any more,"I doubt this will be read. This is the first social anything i have ever done. I like being anti social, the only problem with it is when things get tough i dont have any one to talk to. My life as a dairy farmer, i am in control of the whole running of the property. A contract Milker. The owners are not on the property or hardly around, that is a nice thing, something you dont get too often. When you know you are doing everything you can you don't want the owner looking over your shoulder saying 'Why didnt you tell me about this' when his response would have been to do the action i took. My man of 4 years i met dairy farming for his parents. Before that i was in a stable relationship of 3 years and befreo that, like young and underage, i was promiscuous and a workaholic. I dont even know how to describe how i have gotten where i am. and maybe there is no point and im just writing a piece of crap history in my life that wont help and i just have to keep going? Im afraid of the pain of commiting suicide and im afraid of the person it will hurt. I think i Love him still. but sometimes he is my problem. he is a dairy farmer: contract milker: on the same farm. we are in a contract together making us completely equal. but we are never equal. i hate bagging on him so ill start with the good parts. he is really handy with his hands, like can fix anything (when he wants), if i cant do something ion farm and ask for his help (there might be an argument) but he can get it finished or help me achieve to get it finished. he is better at curing rotten milk cows than me. and i USE to learn things from him. but 3 years ago when we left his parents farm we went contract milking: he has been dairying since he was born so has more practical knowledge than i will ever gain. and he thought it was the right step. but half way through the year it was me feeding the cows, me making sure the fertilizer was on at the correct time to have feed for the cows, me doing the mating detection to be ready for artificial insemination, me raising the calves, me getting up every morning to make sure everything was working like clockwork. im slightly one of those likes to be organized people. also he inhales the horrible green plant. that i hate with an almighty passion. i think that is what makes him lethargic. anyway im off point i just lose track and mumble. there are so many different issues that have put me into this stage of my life. childhood, adolesence, young adulthood. half my life is over. (ive never planned on getting unmobile: freaks me out) and i cant imagine haviong to go through all this hell twice over just to get my original dieing date. why cant i just go skydiving with a knife and cut the straps after i jump."
264,I can't live like this anymore I want to take my life,I just can't handle this any more everyday my body is going through pain and discomfort and nothing I do releases it this causes so my deep depression and have been feeling suicidal of late.
265,My life is pointless,"Boring job, failed relationships, no friends, no kids, no family, failed attempts at changing my life, 33 years old in a month. Alone. Useless. Pointless."
266,Can't take being hurt anymore,"I'm tired of people hurting me and leaving me like I'm nothing. I can't be bothered with people anymore I can't be bothered with anything anymore. There is nothing, I wish I wouldn't wake up."
267,I can't,"I have no fight left. I could go on about all the crap thats happened but its irrelevant. For 28 years people have been telling me it will get better but its an empty promise giving me just enough hope to hold on while in reality just dragging me through more misery. I cant escape debt. I cant enjoy life. I have no friends, no family. I'm alone and broke and miserable and i'm starting to realize that my dreams are pointless and ive set myself up for failure. I give up. I'm not doing this anymore. Life is too short to be this miserable. Let me know if you want anything, i'll mail anyone my stuff, its not like ive got anyone else to give it to"
268,Ramblings of a depressed girl..,
269,Death Wish,"I think something's wrong with me. I feel like there's so much pressure to be successful, to please others, and please yourself. I'm currently active duty military and taking night classes at the same time. and sometimes I wonder why? it'd be so much easier to just not be alive. to just get hit by a car. or maybe something of valor like dying for my country. I welcome that. I would never take my own life. but death seems like it'd be such a relief."
270,Not suicidal but all of my best friends are...,Today my best friends boyfriend texted me telling me that she was in the hospital and od-ed. She's okay. I feel isolated from her sometimes because she likes on campus at a different college than me but that doesn't hinder our friendship. She only briefly mentioned suicide years ago but I was completely blindsided after hearing this news.
271,I feel like a burden to everyone.,This is probably the first time I have written anything on a forum about this. I know I'm not alone...
272,I don't want to live anymore,I just had my 12th interview in the past 9 months and it went horribly bad. I can't find a job and it is to the point where I don't want to live anymore. I have some savings but thats not going to last long. Then after my savings are gone i will have to sell everything I own and then I guess I have to go on welfare.
274,please help me! it's urgent!,She left me. I can't eat. I can't sleep. When I do sleep I have horrible nightmares. I miss her so bad. I just want to die. It doesn't scare me to die. It scares me to live without her. I really am truly considering ending it. I can't see s happy future without her. I just can't stop thinking of her not wanting me. She seems fine. She won't talk to me. She's not with anyone else yet that I know of. How can she just forget all that we had. I know she still loves me but she's convinced herself that I'm not trustworthy. I am though. She won't believe me no matter what I do. I've stopped contacting her but I haven't gone too work. I work alone and it is torture. I just want it to all be over. Please help me see why it's worth suffering through this. I am so alone and sad. I miss her so bad.

278,Done with life,What's the point of just existing in this world?
279,Just sharing a story of suicide and loss - take from it what you will,"A preamble: I'm not here to wax on the morals of self-harm, guilt people into a certain course of action, or provide any sort of spiritual clarity."
280,Any Moms here?,"Hi everyone,"
281,Advice on finding purpose,"Hi. So, I don't have social anxieties. Making friends has always been very easy. Girls don't get under my skin because I don't let them get close enough to hurt me. I'm successful at work, although that means I work 18 hour days. But I just don't see the point. Life is a biological process geared towards procreation. Society and culture can butter it up and invent all manner of strategies but we are simple here to fulfill a animal impulse to spread. I do believe in a creator. But that doesn't give me any sense of well being in this current form. I just don't want the life that the modern world offers. What does that leave us? I don't know, but this is all a bit pointless and silly to me. Humans seem so petty and underdeveloped in their desires and emotions. I would truly like to find a cause or position that required me , but without love for the species or desire to add to it. Now what?"
282,I'm so done....,"It probably sounds ing stupid. This girl I've know (sort of) since 7th grade (5+ years).... about 8 months ago, she said she had feelings for me. She lives in PA, me in AZ. It built up, until she said ""I love you"".... It felt SO amazing. So, six months ago, she made plans to fly out, and we were going to do a first date, then go to Las Vegas, then sight see in AZ. The first day was a relax day. We cuddled, and watched an entire day of movies, before I took her to a nice restaurant for our first date. At the end of the night, as I agreed, she went to sleep in my room, and I went into my spare bedroom. We hugged, I said ""I love you"" and she said ""I love you too""."
283,Feeling numb... my life is falling apart,"I am feeling very low tonight. Things in my life are falling apart... everything. My past has been a mess and it is affecting my now. Family, relationship, work, everything is falling apart. I have no more joy, I am in a very dark depression and no one seems to care... even when I reach out. Funny thing is I fear death, but feel as though I will never get out of this hole I call my life. I guess I just wish the people I cared about cared enough to see the pain I am in, my cries for help but they don't....."
284,Feel so empty... Please help me...,Please be aware this is may be an essay long...
285,Suffering from passive suicidal ideation...what can I do?,I have been feeling like an emotional mess. I graduated from college and have been unemployed for 6 months - employment is on the cards for me soon hopefully.
286,Life Going Down everything going wrong and i am badly depressed and desperate.,"Ia m 21 old guy, my life is going wrong, every and all of it... i posted my problems before also in this thread.but they did not help me i am still in darkness. i am a little bit shy guy and socially awkward guy,i dont have friends girlfriend or anyone to share my feelings with.most of the times i stay alone at home.i still cant find a job because my qualifications are very bad and i have failed my exam,so therefore i cant go to nay job...that is the thing that make me most depress,all of my school mates are in jobs now and they spending happy lives,they do have girlfriends and they do have cars so they enjoying life...but i am still at home alone without job girlfriend or any company sitting in front of computer watching porn or staying outside depress."
287,Everyday is a struggle,"I am such a miserable person. I can't find the joy in anything. No matter how much I try to be normal, there is that quiet voice telling me I am different. Ever since I was a child, I've had depressive moods and emotions. I am highly sensitive and any type of adversity makes me cry or feel overwhelmed. Right now, as an adult, in my mid-20's, I am trying to hold onto a job. The longest I have stayed in a job was 2 months. I am trying to find something I can do, but I just can't relate to people or find myself doing anything. This has been going on for years because I've been depressed all my life. There is something wrong with me, why do I constantly feel this way? My parents told me that I always used to say, ""I can't"" and now I say it again, ""I can't"". Honestly, it feels like I am close to the edge of giving up everything. I just want to be erased and never heard of ever again."
288,Just need a moment...,Looking for a safe place to express how I feel...
289,"I want to end my life, alone depressed and desperate...","i a m a 21 age guy, iam fed up with my life you can see it by my previous posts. iwant to end my life but i dont know how i should do it,,i ma very alone,my damn parents made me this way... i am stucked in home and jobless,i dont have anyone to text call or even talk with me, i am very depressed about my life i want to death and i wish for it every min..... i am very depress becaus e i dont have a job money friends and a gf... iam very dull person...i cant do anything.. i cant think why i live still i tried to change but it didnt work, no girl likes m, i am very dull and boring they only like ssporty type,popular and rich guys, iam just a idiot"
290,I have tried to kill myself twice,"I have tried to commit suicide numerous times. I am 23 and i feel like dying. My mom hates me, my sister only cares about her boyfriend and I am too self-conscience and shy to do change anything. My dad was the only one that cared about me and he had horrible and painful death so every aspect of good in my life got taken away from me. Every girl I run into is disgusted by me, why should I bother trying this is a cry for help and I don't know where to run. The doctor prescribe pills but all they do is give me stomach aches and the only thing that makes me feel anything is alcohol. Please I don't know what to do. I cry myself to sleep every night and I am don't know what to do. Has anyone been through this before?"
291,At what point do you give up asking for help?,"At what point do you give up asking for help? Presumably there's no fix, you either live or die, it doesn't actually matter."
292,I need a Reason to SURVIVE and LIVE,"I was assaulted a year ago and well in order cope with it (b/z the school psychologist sucked) I did everything I wasn't. Joined a sorority, drank, did drugs and my grades spiraled down (mind you I was an A student on a premed track). I met a guy 6 months after the assault, thought I was in love and lost my virginity to him. Yeah dumb move only dated him for what 3 months. Anyways the relationship with the new guy became toxic. Flashbacks came back and I tried to kill myself. I survived and endded up in the psych hospital. I had a flashback of the assault attacked the new guy and he had me arrested. He said he thought I was gona rape him. Even made a video to show cops. A stay away was issued and well since we still 'loved' each other we talked. Then he disappears and after a week sends and email saying his mom has has spyware installed to monitor him and that if she catches him talking to me she will tell the police and send me to jail. Sounds like crap because hes been chatting up with one of his old friends who tried to break us up in the beginning and whom I specifically said I did not like his association with. He hurt me so much that I just lost it and took some pills again and was hospitalized. I called him from the hospital, left him a message he never got back to me. Apparently in his last email he also mentioned how he was hospitalized cuz he tried to hurt himself. He is going through his own family issues BUT you do not decide to just kill yourself one morning. I know that and I know him."
293,End of the Line,"I'm giving up, I'm killing myself. I'm not ashamed to give up because I never signed up for this bull. People are always saying things like: ""well you're not willing to fight"". That's true and I'll admit it. I'm giving up. Life is ing tough and I want out. I'm tired of having to fight myself just to be happy. I'm tired of being in a perpetual state of loneliness. No one loves or wants me, in the true sense. People can say words. I know that because when someone in my ""family"" tells me they love me, I say words back. I know that those words are supposed to be ""I love you too"", so that's what I say. And that's how I know they don't mean it. I've come close to finding love twice, only to have it snatched away from me right when I could taste happiness. I've never needed anything in my life as badly as I've needed someone to love and to be loved back. Of course though, that's only bound to fail and leave me miserable as well. Why? Because I've already put the survival of my happiness (and by extension, me) into two different girls hands, just to have them both crush my heart entirely. Even if I was willing to put everything on the line for a third time, I wouldn't be able to find anyone. I was neglected and abused my entire childhood, which made it impossible to connect with anyone on a real deep level. Despite that, I fought through every bad thought that told me that this was a bad idea and I would get hurt because I knew that what I wanted and needed was for someone to love me. Guess what happened? I got my heart stomped on twice. I even told the second girl about the first and how she treated me. I mean I must have just given her ideas to use against me. The second girl was the one I was closest to and still to this day I can't really shake. She has no idea what she did to me. I say that because she sent me a happy birthday message a couple of months after I was released from a mental hospital. I was in there for an attempt, but she didn't know that. So she sends me some message about how she hopes that this year is the happiest for me and all that bull. Well I snapped. This was the only person I genuinely felt cared for me, but we hadn't really talked since she broke my heart 2 years ago; however, she used to tell me that she still did care for me just not love me. Within that 2 years, I had been steadily circling down the drain (and still am) until I eventually landed in the hospital. Her, she was just casually dating until she found the love of her life and got pregnant. I was aware of this of course and it wasn't a truth that helped my depression. I'd go look at pictures of her on social media and see her post things about her boyfriend like ""he's the most amazing person I've ever met"", "" he's the best person I know"", etc. You know, normal things she would say/should say about her boyfriend. But those are also the things she used to tell me when I was depressed. I can count on one hand the things that people have said to me that made me feel good, happy, whatever, and they all came from her, but now those things don't mean . Mostly because she never meant it with her heart and also because she doesn't mean to me anymore. So as I said, I snapped. The whole time I'm over here contemplating suicide and reminiscing about how I used to be happy with her, she's over there happier than she's ever been. That's why I just lost it when she told me happy birthday. If I didn't know any better, I'd think that she was just ing with me but no one's that evil. That's just one tiny little reason why I've decided lately to hang myself. And don't give me the whole it's better to have loved bit because I never got to love her or the first girl. The way it worked out both times, I became their best friend and couldn't be any closer to either of them. Was I rewarded with a healthy relationship? No. I was just immediately friend zoned and made to continue missing out on that which humans require most. The first girl's excuse was that I was a pothead atheist. And I you not, that is exactly what that girl has become now. The second girl's excuse was that her father hated black people so we would ""never have been able to have anything real"". As I said, that's one tiny reason why I'm hanging myself. I can't keep treading water in this hell by myself. I have no one. I called my mom once while I was in the mental hospital. Out of everyone in my family, I'm closest the least to my mom, but I still called her. I only asked her one thing and that was to tell my carpool that I wouldn't be there for a week. That's all I said and that's the only person I talked to the whole time. I just sat there for a week straight, completely alone, crying to myself. I promised myself in there that once I got out, I wouldn't allow myself to continue suffering this lonely existence and I intend to keep that promise. I guess I'm just gonna hang myself with my belt. I've done a few practice runs and have experienced what its like to almost slip into death so I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. I just wish my life wasn't so that I'll only be found once the smell of death drifts from my room."
294,I am just done. I Wish I took my life when I had the chance to.,"I really should have. I am done with fighting depression. I really dont know what to say so I will just give a little back story. I am 18 and almost out of high school. Unfortunately this year is my worst year, the only girlfriend I will ever have broke up with me and one of my ""best friends"" ruined every chance I had of getting back to her."
295,Friend who is suicidal - I have no idea how to help,"A friend of mine that I met in university here has clearly had a difficult past of depression, and known attempts at suicide."
296,Alone; Wanting Close Friends,"I'm feel so alone right now. I've been feeling this way for awhile now. I kept busy and it staved it. But it returns. I try to make friends. But those friends don't care about me. I want close friends. I keep trying, but all I can make are casual friends that don't give a rip about me. This has been happening for long time now. It has just gotten to the point where I don't know what to do anymore. My creativity is shot. My self-image is shot. I'm discouraged with my ambitions and goals. I just want connection with others. I don't have family near me to interact with and who care about me. I'm tired of superficial friends."
297,I feel very low,I got laid off a week ago from my job without a reason why. Since then I have been pretty emotional and suicidal but I've managed to keep it private and try to be hopeful about the future.
298,effects haunting me,"all of my attempts on my life seem to follow me in my thoughts and dreams everyday. Trying to slash my wrists, od or even throw myself into trasffic.. and so on.. although I wanted them to happen at the time I hate reliving them all the time it just makes me more depressed than I am and want to act on them again just to end it."
299,looking for somebody to talk too,hi there.. im new here. I stumbled accross this page looking for suicide forums.. I was hoping too find somebody to talk to
300,"Someone please help me, I'm running out of time & I'm scared as hell.",Ugh I don't even know where to begin.
301,Time is running out,"Hello, my name is Fro. I have been self harming for the longest time, and you see I have made the decision to attempt suicide..again. Of course I have a reason behind it, my past and the present. You see the nightmares, the bullying, and life just got me tired and I want to go to sleep forever and I don't want to wake up and I just want to be dead. You see my 'friends' aren't really my friends. Its just me helping them through there problems and then when I need help I am ignored. Is that what friends do? Is that how its supposed to be? I don't think it is but that's all I know. My friends are tired of me, I am tired of me, and my family is tired of me. The nightmares are getting to me, the bullies are getting to me, and lastly I am getting to me. I just want done I am done with life. They are gonna fake cry over me, and then a year later I will just be a distant memory. Please, don't make me feel worse than I already do. I just need ways to kill myself. Last time I downed a bottle of pills and ended up in a mental hospital. Yeah so much 'fun', but you see when everyone just looses hope in me..I loose hope in me too. I am just Done, and I am ready to go. I know there is no heaven/hell so no consiquences for my death. I am ready to depart. I am tired of living."
302,I am done,"I don't come on here often, because I have had some negative experiences. I'm here to say that I am going to end my life soon. Call it attention, call it me playing a victim....I don't care...I just want the hurt to stop. It is clear I was a mistake and I am tired of hurting. I'm not doing this crap for another year."
303,???,This catagory seemed most fitting for this question so here it is.
304,Losing Faith in life at the moment,"Hi Everyone,"
305,I don't know if I can kept going on,I don't know if I can kept going on .i have had help in past for tried to kill myself .it been a few months 7 or 8 months That I have been out of the hospital .I'm sill not happy .thing are sill not going the way I want it .

306,I can't get over her and won't let it go,"Is there truly a time in any persons lives where they have lost all hope on ever getting the girl back? I don't care anymore about people saying ""there are a million fish in the sea,"" "" go have fun because you are single,"" "" eventually you will get over her."" What if it is the case where everything in the world is going right for you but this one thing, this one perfect girl that you will never stop caring for, loving unconditionally and truly devoting everything to her is gone."
307,Yeah uh...Mental Hospital?,"Alright, I know you guys encouraged me not to attempt suicide but I just got drove overboard by this tiny little thing and I just ran home and grabbed a rope and yeah it was bad. My rope knot slipped so, here I am living...I guess. Well I have been wearing turtlenecks and scarfs to cover up my rope marks so my parents will not see. I cannot do this any longer, and when my parents caught me cutting they threatened a mental hospital. Suicide attempt will send me to ER and then Mental Hospital. I tried 3 days ago and haven't been noticed yet. I am bound to get noticed."
308,Would It Be So Bad?,"As the saying goes, when it rains, it pours. Well lately it seems that I am stuck in some torrential downpour that I can't get out of. Lately it seems that I ave made a real mess of my life. Things started going wrong when just about 10 years ago, my husbands mistress called to let me know that she was engaged to my husband and much to my chagrin, my now ex told me he was in love. The divorce process was exhausting, had it not been for the fact that I was pregnant with our 5th child, I think I would have ended things a long time ago but I couldn't harm an innocent. In between him not realizing that I was a human with feelings and his mistress calling me a because he told her our children were from another man, I believe I went emotionally numb. I lived in a few shelters for sometime before I became stable and then five years down the road, I had an emotional breakdown that led to the loss of my job. On top of that, despite swearing the children and child support off, Mr. Ex said that he wanted full custody. Although I have the promise of a new job, the pay will won't even help to make ends meet."
309,Is this normal?,"I guess I can't remember the last time I was happy or liked myself..even when I was younger. Everyone talks about how happy their childhood was and I seemed to have blocked mine, I don't really remember anything but the things I do remember are horrible. When I met my now ex I felt so much better like someone actually cared about me, I couldn't even bring myself to hug family members, I was very emotionally stunted but he brought me out of my shell and lifted me up. After a while though the goodness wore off and things got tough for me and I started to self harm. A lot of bad things have happened these past two years but he's always been there for me. Now he's left me and I'm ill and two of my family members are seriously ill and I'm probably going to fail college but I can't leave otherwise we'll get kicked out of the house and I just have too much going on and too much to cope with."
310,Help,"I checked my ex's skype because I knew he was speaking to someone, I shouldn't have looked I know I shouldn't have looked, I couldn't help it!"
311,My brother tried to kill himself and my parents are doing nothing?????,"My brother has been very depressed lately. I live with him, his girlfriend and my parents. He has been depressed for quite awhile and he has recently started to display violent tendencies when he fights with his girlfriend. He has punched the walls twice and has broke his door. He now neglects to take care of his dog."
312,"i want to end my life now, i want a personality","i am still looking for job.life sucks for me,no friends,no girlfriend and no one to share my feelings,i sleep all day along with damn regrets i did in past,i dont know why i fell like this,my friends hangout with each other but im salone they have girlfriends and many friends to text and call,but no one for me,my mim say im very childish,i look like a girl though im a guy,i think its the reason nobody or girl likes me,i feel very shy uncomfortable in the society,feels so weird when i talk with someone else i cnat look at their eyes,my damn personality sucks,and iam so hideous,i badly wnt a girlfriend but its not working for me,i hav nothing to do other than sleeping or watching porn.i have a very weak body,i am not good at sports or at gym,i spet most of the day thinking overthinking whats wrong with me,why i cant be like others,i have facebook account,but no friends forme there,its a damn pain,my profile pic only gets 2likes, i cry sometimes while my friends and others gt 200 or more likes,and im very shy at photos my life is very very dark,everyday i wish o die,by a car accident or something, whay i am the only one born this dan way,i want to end my damned life"
313,He's gone,I don't know why I'm posting this. There is nothing anyone can say or do to fix this.
314,mourning and loneliness,"For the last five months my whole life has been dedicated to band. For any of you who have been in nice marching band would understand how much time goes into it. In this time I stared to bond a lot with my section. There was one guy who I perticularly took an interests to. We had the same music taste, the same interests, and the same goals and ideas. We became quick friends and started to hang out all the time. One evening we were at rehearsal and it was going normal . Everything was fine when we all went home for the night . However, in the morning my heart sank when I walked into the bandhall and saw him crying. Up to that point he was the happiest person I had ever seen. He always had a smile and was making everybody laugh . Later that day he told me that his friend (ex girlfriend) had killed herself . And that they wernt on good terms. It has been about eight weeks since and he is doing a lot better . When she died he opend up to me. He became my best friend and I was determined to help him through. We have gotten so close since then. I also let him in deeper than Ive let anyone else. We both have a lot of scars and hurt that we have been through . Lately he has been the reason I uget up in the morning. But I can't shake this feeling of loneliness . I need someone there for me all the time that I can turn to for everything. I couldn't think of a better person than him. I told him I liked him and he feels the same way . But he is not ready for a relationship and I completely understand. But for me , I can't be alone anymore . My ex boyfriend whom I was still with at the time killed himself about a year ago. I haven't even touched a man since. I need it . And this guy who I have come to love can't do it for me . And even though he means so much to me I can't wait. I am a pretty young lady and I will have no trouble to start dating . But its not what I want. I just need to feel something. I know I won't loose him as I friend if I date other people but I will probably loose any chance of being more than that in the future . I feel like I'm being selfish , but I'm trying to put myself first for once in my life . And I know I'm young (17) but I have been through so much. I know there will be other men but none that can say the things him and I can . The things we've worked through together. For the first time in a long time I'm happy . So is it worth it to wait however long it may take and be lonely to the point of severe depression. Please help me gather my thoughts."
315,I'm done with my life..,"I really need help. I don't know what to do though. I feel suicidal all the time, and self harm always seems like the right way to go.. I feel like no one actually cares about me, I don't really feel close to anyone at all, and there just doesn't seem to be anything to live for.. I don't come from your typical all-american family. I was sexually, physically, and emotionally abused as a child. I was bullied in school because growing up, my family didn't have very much money, so I was forced to wear clothes that often times didn't fit and weren't really ever ""in style."" When I was sixteen, I met a girl who seemed to change my life. She would always make me smile, and whenever we hung out I was truly happy, which I hadn't been in a very long time. But things changed somewhere along the way.. About three months into our relationship, I moved in with her, because her mom realized how bad my situation was at home. But the problem was, after about a month or so, I started to feel as if I didn't want to be in the relationship any longer, but I was too nice and cared too much for her to break it off. Now we're sixteen months into our relationship, and I'm torn down the middle. Eventually I want to get back together with this girl, and maybe even get married, but right now, I want to date other people.. I'm not sure where to go and what to do anymore.. If I break up with her, I have to go live with my mom again, who is a very abusive person. If I stay with her, I'll never get the chance to date other people and see if this girl is actually the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. Please, someone help me.. I don't know where to turn and what to do.."
316,I want to be strong.,I'm not sure why I'm writing this. Desperation probably as I'm about to fall to bits and get into another panic.
317,Cant see the bright side to life..,I'm new to the Forum.
318,What a horrible year,"I thought this would be the year in which I would get a job. I was positive I would get something earlier this year even though I had no money. A voluntary position came up which sounded interesting. The place was new but said about getting money and stuff. A few months later, nothing. Most of the money was spent on equipment. I did a lot of work for them, but just didn't feel happy. I only got a small sum of money from them when I left, I was angry and grateful for it. Since then I tried posting my CV to places in person. Most were family run businesses. I even tried agencies but one was pretty rude saying ""we have so many CVs to go through""."
319,I've been feeling suicidal,"Hi, I've been feeling suicidal quite a lot lately. I am in counseling and she knows about my feelings. I don't know if writing on here will help but I just thought I'd give it a try."
320,I want to go,I want to go and leave this earth
321,My looks are really depressing me,"I have a really ugly face and I am extremely depressed because of it, it's not just in my mind or anything. I hear it all the time in public, I get a lot of people staring at me, whispering about it and saying stuff like ""I bet she has a sparkling personality,"" etc.. I look really ugly and like a man. I wasn't always ugly though.. in fact a year ago I looked just fine. I had an eating disorder and after I got to a proper weight, my face started changing and for the worst.. I'd never been called ugly in public until summer of 2013, I didn't even notice how much my face had changed. Someone on another answering site said it's probably because I tampered with the levels of subcutaneous fat in my face and since I got my eating disorder during puberty (I was almost 15) and that it's very likely my eating disorder could have changed my face because I probably got rid of muscle and subcutaneous fat when I developed it (I was eating like 500-1000 calories a day and dropped 45 pounds in 5 months) Which is a lot considering I wasn't even overweight to begin with. But now I am severely depressed, I can't go outside because I got really sick of the nasty comments, I get laughed at at school, I have no friends because of social anxiety.. and being ugly is making it 200% worse. I honestly do not care about anything except how ugly i am and I'm set on getting at least 50k of plastic surgery because I can't accept it.. I can't be happy ugly and that's that. I like shopping for clothes and it's no fun at all when you're ugly, I hate being the ugly/plain friend so I don't even want any friends. My future feels hopeless until I get plastic surgery. I really want to fall in love one day but I doubt anyone will before plastic surgery with the ugly face I have. I want to get tattoos and piercings but again that's no fun when you're ugly.. It's not fair, there are literally zillions of DNA combinations and I get stuck with THIS one.."
322,"I need to escape my life, in SOME way, any way!!!!","I can't stand my life anymore and I have to talk to somebody. The thing is, I don't want any attention from my family or friends so I can't talk to them but they're part of the problem anyway so this is the only place I can turn to. I am so withdrawn that I can barely talk to my family anyway so that is not an option."
323,This burden is gonna be the death of me.,I have brought up this before in a rundown story in my first post.
324,"I'm a useless great loser, I don't deserve to live","I think you guys might remember me. Last year, I was really alone and wanting to enter college. Well, I did it. From the end of 2012 to half 2013, my life was almost perfect. I now had a girlfriend who would love me, started the process to finally drive a car on the streets, met new people on a videogame tournament outside my city, and lost a LOT of weight (I had 89 kg, I went to 80). Everything went perfect."
325,"If you're truly objectively ugly, do you think life is worth living?",What do you think?
326,What now?,I've written the note. What now?
328,Thinking about suicide,"I have had suicidal feelings every now and but not for a couple of years. It all happened when I met a girl a week ago and now we are going for a date next weekend.But one day after meeting this girl I felt depression coming and now I have been in depression about five days. I have been using medication (Efexor depot) before but not at the moment. But is why this depression comes when things are going to a better direction? I am having these feelings that I cant live for a much longer and that I want to kill myself.I am 29 years old now and I had really bad depression 5 years ago and this time it is not that bad, but if I am thinking about killing myself... I still keep up my happy image so nobody knows.So if you hame something helpful words I would like to hear.."
329,Being ignored,"It started with me moving a cross country after deciding to move in with my boyfriend, and him telling me after I changed everything for him, that it wouldn't work between us. We fought a lot and for a long time. Us trying to make it work, and fighting about everything. I've been very vocal about what I wanted to do to my boyfriend, his best friend and another commun friend, both to try and feel better about it like venting and both because I wanted my boyfriend to help me. I ended up in the hospital after taking all my pain killers. I have fibromyalgia. My heart stopped, I had to be monitored for a week. During this week, my boyfriend tried to be there for me but in the end he told me, while being in ICU, that it was too much for him to handle and he needed a break. Side note: when he was in a similar situation I never left his side."
330,life didn't get better,I'm desperate I'm asking for help from strangers on internet
331,I keep coming back to the same conclusion... I want to kill myself,"No matter what I do I keep coming back to the same suicidal feelings. Whenever I'm around people, I feel it. I just feel like I never fit. I feel rejected. I just feel like I'm not supposed to be here. I get depressed and then I come out of it, but I just end up right back here."
332,It is so hard to go on,I have a kind soul and very much a giving person but I feel a life is being taking away from me
333,I hate this life now....badly want to suicide or die...,I am a 21year old guy....im tall fair and very skinny and pale (thats how others describe me) & im a Loser.... im a very shy and hideous person...even cant talk loud...my mm say im lot like a girl in my behaviour...i never did any sports i feel very uncomfortable in society...i feel like everyone look at me and laugh inside...so when i at public i feel uncomfortable and therefore i ruin every my works at public....it feels very hard when i at public my words get tangled and i feel like sweating when i talk with people....
335,Are there other people out there that feels this way?,"I'm not planning to kill myself, I don't know. I am just tired of life. I am deaf, by the way. Yes I do have a therapist."
336,The end is nigh,"Hello all. Not really sure why I'm posting this as it probably won't be answered considering my previous history with this forum, but for some reason I find it at least marginally fulfilling to write this."
337,the past eight years,Perhaps an odd subject for a first post but I there are very few ways in which I am comfortable thinking about the subject.
338,My Mom tried... still not over it,When I was maybe 15 my mom tried to commit suicide. My father lied to me and said she just took too much medication.
339,The Only Thing I Think About,"I'm Nineteen and that being said, I know that my life is not that horrible. I know that there are things yet to look forward to and I know that at some point things may change, but I feel like I am in a steel box with no holes in it. Just a cold prison in which to be left to my devices. I have no self worth and feel as though this world and certainly my family would be better off without me. Reality is harsh and I have no interest in being a part of it. Recently I told my mother about how I have been feeling this way for quite a while. That was a huge mistake. I'm sure that she did not mean it to come accross in such a way but the conversation that ensued served mainly as a list (from my perspective) of some more reasons that I might as well die. Among this list was my lack of motivation, or interest in anything not pertaining to video games and the list was finished with ""either you find a way to be interested in school or you go to a hospital""."
340,I hate life.... Im going to suicide soon,Im 21 year old guy...i dont have much friends most of time i live alone at home...my parents and friends say im very shy & girlish...im.very fair and skinny...not beautifull....im not good at any sports or im not active...so most of time i sleep or going through depression forums or watching porn on internet..cause i dont have anyother thing to do...cause im a loser..i failed at school exam..no job now and i never had a girlfriend or not even a female friend (tears)
341,I'm ANGRY,I'm angry. I hate how unfair life is and will continue to be.
342,So I've considered it before...,"All my life I've been neglected, let down, abused. My parents divorced when I was 7, my mom got into drugs and my dad was an alcoholic."
343,living dead at 6,"my story is not usual, i was sitting in my room watching this show i loved i don't quite remember the name of the show because i was so young but it was a paper cut out animation show. black and white. i sat and watched and then my adopted brother pulls me into his room tied me up and raped me. when he was finished he gave me a trading card and said this was for me. i didn't even know what had happened to me till i grew up and realized at the age of 13 i knew i had been raped. i told my younger sister the day it happened and she didn't know what had went on either. we were just kids at the time and was confused."
344,I'm going to die soon,I'm gonna commit suicide tonigjt
345,spending my birthday with trying to die,"I wanna die, I really want to."
346,Hearing suicidal voices,"Hi there,"
347,Need some hope right now....,Hello. I'll keep this short. Just came out of a relationship recently. Only was for only a few months but I fell hard. Anyway now I'm thinking I have nothing to look forward to in life and my best option is to do something radical to take this pain and loss away.
348,I've lived a good life,At 35 I must say I have lived a great life. I have loved and lost and loved again. In between I sought treatment and thought I out it back together.
349,I feel like a ghost...,"I never thought I'd be writing on a forum such as this. I'm not trying to demean it, but that's how bad things are for me right now. I feel overwhelmingly alone and abandoned. I am prone to getting depressed easily and have been to a psychologist in the past only once, but I refused to go back. I figured I could deal with my depression and anxiety on my own, and for the most part I have been able to, but usually it has never lasted this long (two weeks now). It feels like everyday slows down further in order to optimize the feeling of hatred that I have for myself and for my life. There were a few catalysts, namely my boyfriend broke up with me, and then my best friend got mad at me because I was being emotional and has stopped talking to me, then my boyfriend came back to me, but then people told him about a past situation of mine (from five years ago), which angered him and he broke up with me again. Piled on top of that that people are being very spiteful and mean to me or just not caring at all that I'm truly despondent."
350,I have given up,"I am 29 years old, and I know for sure now that I simply do not care about anything anymore. I wake up with a feeling of impending doom, and lack any motivation whatsoever to change my life for the better. I just don't know what to do anymore, and it hurts to know that I can change, but simply do not have the strength anymore to even try."
351,I don't know what to do anymore...,I'm new here and I came accross this forum on thinking about ways of trying to escape my life.
352,I Almost Jumped,"I've been in a pretty bad place, mentally, lately. I could go down the list of things going on in my life that have left me with no real will to do anything. I've just divorced my wife who, for our entire relationship, has lied and cheated on me with three (from what I know) different men. Currently, I'm a single father and I've had to move back in with my parents because at the moment, I'm a ""starving artist"". My parents and I don't speak. To this day, I can't recall a single conversation between my parents. It's been that way since I was a child. They never showed any affection or emotion to me... or to each other for that matter. When I told them I was getting a divorce, my father just looked at me and my mom told me to get over it. I must add that they are my adoptive parents and I don't know anything about my biological parents. I'm almost 15 now and I've got no idea what to do with myself. I've done my best to focus on my art and be a good father but I seem to be getting nowhere. It's been hell trying to find an actual job due to the decisions I made when I was 18-19 years old to sell drugs and do a lot of other things that I have long since given up. It didn't take long for me to realize that the life I was leading was going to get me nowhere but dead or in jail. I've spent the last few years rebuilding and making sure that I live my life right. Everyone says that they love my photographs but I have made very little money from them and it's getting harder and harder to get up everyday and do what I love knowing that I'll likely not see any profit from any of this until I'm too old to appreciate any of it."
353,i feel like i'm on the verge of losing control and doing something stupid,"-This is long. If you make it through, you're a saint. I've been down lately... like, seriously down. I'd normally never admit this, but I've been having dark thoughts the past couple days that involve hurting myself and it's scaring me. It scares me because before, no matter how blue I got, I knew I'd never actually do anything... but now that line is becoming a bit blurred. A couple months ago I ended a 5 year relationship. I cared a lot for this person, but their inability to hold a job for more than a few months was wearing me thin. I know what you're thinking... if you stuck around with that for 5 years it's your own fault. But it's not that simple. We connected... really connected... and both in our mid twenties when we met. I thought there was hope... that they just needed someone to guide them. I was there once, so I could relate to the desire to get your s**t together but not having the slightest clue how to go about it. Well during this process, when the recession hit back in 2000-whatever, I lost my job. We were living off of my unemployment and the occasional contribution from my partner. At that point I was dependent on those contributions, no matter how small, just to make ends meet. I took out a title loan on my car to try to cover rent once my savings ran dry. I wound up losing the apartment anyway, and the car as well. So there we were... broke and sued for the remainder of the lease plus legal fees which came up to several thousands of dollars. We found a seedy little place that didn't ask too many questions (because I was just evicted and sued, my options were pretty much ZERO) and moved in. The place was infested with cockroaches and no matter how hard we tried we couldn't kick them. I had found a part-time temp job by this point, and one day at work a roach crawled out of my backpack in the break room in front of about a dozen people. There was ghasping and other unpleasant reactions. I was so humiliated I ran to the bathroom and cried. About an hour later I was told my assignment was over and not to come back."
355,Afraid to break up,"I'm seeing this girl (would be a year in November) and I want to break it off. I'm just not happy with her anymore. She stresses me out to the point where I am so depressed that it hurts, and I'm afraid to say things sometimes or confront her about anything because she tends to be argumentative and I never really feel appreciated or heard. We still care for each other and I think breaking up would be best for both of us. However, I really need some advice on how to go about this."
356,I am considering committing suicide but I don't know the best way to do it,"So, this is my first post and if I go ahead it may be my last. I am 13 and everything in my life just seems to have gone wrong. I am extremely depressed, I struggle at school and to make it worse I am bullied, every day at school for me is a living hell but if I go ahead I won't have to worry about being beaten up every day. Suicide has been on my mind for at lest 4 years now I have came close to going through with suicide many times and I am already self harming. I am finding myself drifting closer and closer to suicide, and I have already tried twice aswell. Should I kill myself or not?"
357,suicide starting to make sense in my head right now...,"i dont even know how i feel... honestly, i cannot even wrap my head around a rational thought tonight. im am coming down off cocaine as i type this... a much too routine user, especially as of late trying to walk away from it this time for good... GOD, the withdrawals... why IS IT I NEVER REMEMBER THEM AS I SNORT THAT LINE JUST ONE MORE TIME - bull i convince myself. the withdrawals play on my emotions wickedly... and when i started using more regularly they also have begun making me very SUICIDAL. it scares the out of me because the dark feelings dont disappear for hours, days sometimes and tonight i find myself at the very end of the rope. sober do i wanna die?? i dont know... i hardly ever am sober lately... and when i am i suicide still sits somewhere in my thoughts randomly... logically, i know it doesnt make sense. LOGICALLY I KNOW I DONT WANT TO DIE BUT my THOUGHTS TELL ME OTHERWISE... i can talk myself logically until i am blue in the face but LOGIC DOESNT WIN, HOW I FEEL DOES>>> and that in scares the hell out of me. tonight... i was trying TO PICK OUT THE BEST WAY ID LIKE DYING>> like hanging myself... or jumping off something... pills... yes PILLS WON OUT> IS WRONG WITH ME ???"
358,Im fading away,I need to talk about this and i guess not having to do it face to face is best.
359,I'm in a scary place...,"I'm sorry about my first post being so serious, but I don't know what else to do. I would appreciate any help."
360,Back here again,"I've posted here before when i was feeling this way, sorry to do this again"
361,Bizarre family dynamics,My father was in a severe car accident that left him with an aquired brain injury.
362,My thoughts on suicide and death...,"I have been reading enotalone and several other forums for years now, but only recently decided to create an account to post. Before i post a few tidbits about my thoughts on suicide, below is some pertinent background info about me:"
363,my boyfriends live in ex died lastnight,I met my boyfriend off
364,I don't have a reason or purpose,I'm a 35 year old male I was married for 18 years and my wife left me. I was so wrapped up in my depression and I never talked to her about it. Everything that I ever did I screwed up everything and I'm sick of it. I have no reason to live anymore no purpose NOTHING. I'm going to kill my self. I have to there's no other way. I don't have any friends. And I don't TRUST ANYONE. As soon as I get my will signed witch I hope will be Friday I can do this. It's the best decision I've ever made and I'm at piece with it and I'm happy about it. I'm going far into the woods I don't want to be found I don't want services. No one will probably look for me any way. I don't know what else to do I don't know how I'm supposed to feel or say
365,Maybe this time...,***I'm not sure what counts as trigger content but there may be some in this post***
366,loser,"I am a 30 year old loser who has never accomplished or had anything worthwhile in his entire life. I don't think I have a very bright future, I think I am going to die soon.."
367,If my life doesn't get better I will kill myself,"I've been given a terrible life and this year has gotten worse. I can't handle anymore. I'm trying desperately to find a job and keep getting rejected after rejected. I can't find any job, I've even applied at fast food and retail but was told I am overqualified (which I am with 15 years job experience and a masters). Then there's my guy situation where the one I want hasn't come around and I don't know if he will. I don't want anyone else and besides at my age the pickings are slim (and I refuse to settle). This on top of the fact that I suffer from arthritis which is normally mild but due to stress is acting up. I also have psoriasis and that's acting up too because of the stress. Also, my aunt died of cancer this fall at 45."
368,the noose grows tighter every day,"i feel infinitely bored and it's driving me to the bring of a. suicidal thoughts and behavior b. dangerous/thrill seeking behavior c. homicidal thoughts. i don't know how to explain it but i feel disinterested in every single thing i do and i can't take it, man. i don't wanna feel like this anymore."
369,I think I might be done.,"My life is actually great. I teach a class at one of the most prestigious universities in the US. I am also going there, studying things I'm interested in. I also have a low-stress job that pays more than what most people make. I have a 1-room studio that I don't mind. I have people in my life who would be very sad if I passed away. I go to therapy once a week and have an amazing therapist."
370,...,Basic history...
371,feeling suicidal after break up,Hi there. Im a 31 year old man and father of 3 lovely kids and iv just split up from my wife.wev been together on and off for 13 years now and married for 3. Iv had to leave my home and at the minute im back in my mams.i cant eat .my eyes are red raw from constant crying.i cant sleep a wink and im absolutely exhausted .physically and mentally.all I can think of is ending my life and this pain which is non stop chipping at my heart and my head. I found text messages on her phone under her sisters name but after a bit of investigation it became clear it was another man.this broke me in half.when the truth became clear my wife became very angry and violent towards me punching me into my face while holding our 4year old boy who was crying because he heard us arguing.i was on the top of the stairs holding him when she hit me.she spat in my face and ripped up my passport in anger at being found out.i know its easy to say walk away but for all her faults I still adore her and love her to pieces. The thoughts of another man touching her or being with her destroys me and I cant cope with the image in my head.please help me before I do sonething stupid.
372,22 day of NC: wishing myself a fast and painless death,"My ex boyfriend of 7 months (the serious and the perfect one I was living with) broke up with me 22 days ago by confessing me that he was spending all this time with me because of convenience and not because he loved me. He said that love has disappeared at the time we started living together induced by my monotonic lifestyle, busy work-at-home schedule (he always went to sleep alone and I was still working) and the fact that not only his friends saw nothing interesting in my personality, but all of his family wished him to break up with me sooner because I wasn't the type they imagine in their circle (financially poor and totally dependent on him). He was living with me, hearing all those negative words about me from his family members, as well as wishing to know the painless way to break up with me and not to break my heart into pieces (emotionally I was head over heels for him and he was everything to me)."
373,The one I love is hurting,"My boyfriend confided in me recently that he is suicidal. I moved to his area from out of state and my family members that I've been living with have decided to send me back to my hometown, so I won't be able to see him very much, but we've decided to continue our relationship despite the long distance. I'm really worried about him though because he says that thinking about me not being here makes him really depressed and I'm afraid that he might try to commit suicide while I'm away. I don't think there's anyone in his life that I can talk to about it that would stay cool about it and watch over him to make sure he's content and I don't know what to do other than reassure him that I'll stay faithful and talk to him everyday. Thinking about it brings me to tears, I'm just so scared for him."
374,I Can't Go On Like This,"Hello. This is my first time on this site but I just needed help. Needed someone to speak to. I'm scared. No I'm terrified. I've been ill with clinical depression since I was 13 (I am now 18 ) and I am on strong medications for it. I have had rough points as well as slightly higher points, as everyone does. But my rough points have been bad. I've tried to commit suicide 4 times now. Each time being caught and stopped by someone. And now....I thought I was better, then something happened. The only friend, the only one I have left in this pathetic world left me. Hates me now. Because I messed it up. I'm poison to others, I destroy them. So many people have left me and they never come back all because I'm a bad bad person. So right now, I'm scared, because I....Well I want to die, but I' scared to, I'm scared by this feeling. Scared that my family would never forgive me. Scared of the pain of death. But I just see no other options left."
375,Reocurring suicidal ideation,"I don't know where to begin, but for years whenever I've been feeling down suicide has always been a thought/mild consideration. Is this normal, do most people consider suicide through their life? I know at this point I could never go through with hurting my family but sometimes I just get so fed up with all the stress I feel, that I have nobody to talk to about. There is not a single person I can look at and comfortably tell them that I think about killing myself from time to time, that I obsessively worry about my looks & finding a girlfriend, that I'd be 100% willing to be in an abusive relationship and that I cry over something or another about once a week or more(like right now). Compounding this I have job that I hate, it's third shift which adds onto me worrying about my looks. I know this would so petty to someone with actual problems but to me it's all so real and it's just really hard to have to feel like I'm going through it alone. I don't tell friends or family members all this because the last thing I need is there harsh judgment. Who knows what my friends would think, I'm always so aloof, light hearted and charismatic around them, I don't need them judging me or thinking I'm frail (although I really really am). I have a few girls who are interested in me and they seem like such nice people but the physical attraction just isn't there and I don't want to lead them on. I've been told by people before that I should seek therapy but I'm on my dad's insurance as his is better than the one my job provides me with so I couldn't get it without him finding out, and I'm strongly against the idea of medication. I know this post was really arbitrary, it was a bit of a rant but advice would be appreciated."
376,Attempted suicide but couldn't do it,I can't take much more of my life anymore. It seems like everything is just spiraling down. I won't spare much of the details since I'm done talking about it.
377,Question about suicide,If you feel like your family would be better off without you is that a good enough reason to kill yourself? If you don't have friends either. If pain blots out anything good that you use to keep yourself going. Maybe it would be better to just end it?
378,my epic fail,So im 22 years old I have had many suicidal thoughts. I have done almost everything like cutting my wrists down the road trying to bleed out and i even tried to cut so deep to my femoral vein in my leg to bleed out.I ended up not going deep enough and stitches. I have researched options like drinking household items or eat rat poison. I decided on non of those because I could just end up on life support and that would be worse. I would get in fights with my boyfriend and have him tell me he doesn't want me. Most of the time that triggers this emotion like if he doesn't want me I dont want to be in this world. I wanted an easy way out. So a little background is I do have a drug problem im not currently talking to a therapist of anything. I have been very broke and decided I will find a way to mess myself up so bad Ill need painkillers for a long while. Some I could sell and some that I could get high. So I made a deal with a few friends to break my knee I told them I would give them part of the pills i get so they could sell em and make money. First I had my friend swing a metal pipe at my knee 4 times well she missed a couple and hit my shin. I read that a blow to the knee can tear ligaments.
379,Ugh...,"I'll admit... I suffer from BPD, and the ups and downs are pretty nasty. They make me feel awful. But my major qualm is that I'm in physical pain 24/7. When I say that, I'm not exaggerating. If I take over the counter aspirins it helps a tiny bit. If I take narcotic painkillers, it helps a little bit (if I can even get my hands on some). Nothing seems to truly rid the pain from my body. Reasons for my pain: TMJ, IBS, GERDS, excessive dental carries, hemicrania continua, and more (disabling depression, anxiety, nausea). Mostly treatable things if you can afford to pay the huge medical bills. I can't. No insurance. Rejected for medicaid twice. I am so so so sick and tired of being in pain. This has been going on too long and I am just fed up."
380,i need some help,"this is my first post, so i'll try to be brief. i don't feel like i have any true friends. yes, i have some people i talk to and see outside of school, but when it comes to stuff like that, i'm always the second person. what i mean by that is unless it's me and one other person talking one-on-one, no one even acknowledges the fact that i'm a part of the conversation. i'm not a first priority in anyone's eyes. i also am not to fond of my life as a whole. i see others in the hall ways, enjoying school, enjoying their friends, enjoying their life. then i get jealous and start to wonder ""why is my life not even filled with the slightest amount of happiness/fun"". i always find myself sulking around, trying to talk to people (but obviously in vain). i just feel that i suffer the most, work the hardest, try to be the nicest, be the best listener, and i always get the short end of the stick; i never get any appreciation. and of course the one thing i want the most (or pretty much everyone for that matter) is to be in a loving relationship. i never feel that i'm more than ""just casual friends"" with classmates, girls, anyone. add all these factors plus my incredibly negative personality and depression problem, and you get the basics of my daily life. but the thing is i know these people care about me, i just never see it displayed/on at least a semi regular basis. i just want to feel like i matter to people."
381,I need help,"Sometimes, i think i can just keep going on and hope something good will happen in the future."
382,I can't sleep at all,"Lots of people are not great sleepers. Mine is very serious. I stay up from 10am to 2pm often trying to sleep and as soon as I sleep for an hour or two I wake up again. This has been going on for two years. I can't remember the last time I had a full night sleep but I think it was 3 months ago. I keep having to call in sick because if I don't sleep at least 2 hours then I just cant work., I wake up at least once sometimes four times a night since then I cant sleep at all. I do all the right things. Even take sleeping pills now and they barely work. Tried melonin which backfired. I dont eat too much before bed. I open my window. etc and etc I tried some relaxation techniques that worked the most but not near enough. My brain just does not stop thinking, I keep going round and round. Even when I am able to slow my brain down I still toss and turn endlessly. I tried imagining a magic world that worked when I was a kid. Nothing works now. I think lots stress (lots of family problem with my parents, in-laws, brothers, sister) and my two small kids waking me up at nights a few years ago did me in. Before I would try to sleep for an hour and I will and would never wake up ever. A few months ago, I had a span of five nights in a row where I slept great (probably I had 10 good nights the whole year) but my friend did something horrible to me and I was back to square one. If I have one horrible night, it takes me weeks just to get even slightly better even when the original problem that caused it is not even on my mind anymore. I have a wonderful life but even the fun things are very difficult, it is just about making it through the day. I feel horrible ignoring my kids, my wife doing the parenting alone on many days and letting my work down despite my boss being very nice about it. It just never ends. Please help!!!! I don't know what is going on with me. Doctors could find nothing. I cant live like this. I have heart pain now too for some reason. If someone has any new ideas that can work, I would be grateful."
383,I'm in a really bad place and I'm all alone,"I've been self-harming for years, but this year things started getting alot worse. It wasn't just feeling upset and getting better after a little while, it's pretty much constant. I've pretty much lost all hope and I feel stupid for even asking for help because really my life isn't that horrible when compared to others and I know that other people have things happening in their lives too. I feel so guilty about imposing myself onto them. Most of the people I would usually talk to just can't be bothered anymore. I think that they're sick of me and might even hate me cuz now all they see is this pathetic broken creature who's simply fighting against what's more or less fated. It's not necessarily that I want to kill myself, it's more that I desperately want it all to stop. I want all the pain to go away and I don't want to have to go through any of the bad things again. I'm constantly being called a or a , but I've only ever kissed one boy, and that was this year, the boy promptly informed me that he was interested in a sex only relationship with me and nothing emotional because as he said ""I've been through so many bad relationships lately and I just want something casual"" then about three weeks later he has a girlfriend. That actually happens tome alot. My ""friend"" has decided she hates me cuz I'm friends with a boy she is also friends with. Everyone just deserts me when I'm in a bad place because they can't be bothered. It's like screaming into a void- no one hears me. No one helps me. I just want things to stop hurting so much, I want the to get better, I want to believe that I can afford to care about things again and that I can have real hope again and that I deserve it. Right now all I can think is how much better the world would be without me- there would be a little less darkness, no one would have to worry, no one would even notice I bet."
384,single mother at the end of her rope..,Ok... I'm so sick & tired of living my life.
385,"I don't want to live looking like this, the past is haunting me..","I know this sounds really shallow but I really am ugly. I look like a man. I have a really bad nose, it's big and it has a bump in the bridge of it. My pores are really huge and they stand out. My jaw is slightly too big and I just resemble a man a lot. I literally can't go anywhere without being called ugly and it's making me really depressed. I also have social anxiety and I'm very socially awkward. I have no friends left because I lost them all out of depression, and when I think about it I don't deserve friends. I used to talk behind their backs, sometimes even be a to their face just for a laugh, I stole a couple things from my friends, blame them for things I did. I used to joke around about really serious stuff to the point where if anyone with a lot of morals heard me I'd probably be beaten to death. I'd make fun of people for no reason, I thought creating drama and starting fights on the Internet with people was the best thing. I called this girl fat a while ago and she ended up at my high school, told everyone what I said and my cousin ganged up on me with her (my cousin and I used to be best friends) and told everyone about how I don't even deserve friends because of the way I treated them and told them all about making fun of other people and even some of the nasty things I said. I don't know why I did it or said it, this all happened when I was 13. I'm turning 17 on the 13th now but it's well known around the school and now everyone is judging me based on the way I acted. I lost my very last (and first) best friend because I am just not fun to be around anymore and my depression really shows, plus she's an extreme extrovert and has tons of friends and loves to be around as many people as possible. So we just grew apart because of that. My cousin told everyone I stole a couple of her things and some of the mean things I said and did, the way I talked about my old friends. Yeah now everyone knows what a ty person I was.. so it's not like I have a high chance of making any friends. I haven't made a friend since I got here more than 4 years ago. I have depression, nothing interests me anymore, I'm afraid to go outside because whenever I do I hear someone whisper ""she's f*cking ugly,"" or I bet she has a sparkling personality to make up for it. Some strangers even look at me and chuckle to themselves openly. Everyone thinks I deserve it because I called that girl fat (and a few of her other friends) a long time ago. I was just really immature, bratty and ignorant. Also whenever I pass my cousin now on the streets she makes a point of raising her voice just so I can hear her insult me out loud, her friends that go to my school laugh hysterically at how ugly i am everytime i see them and are spreading the way I acted before around. It's too late to apologize now. They'd probably call me desperate because I have no friends trying to apologize.. I truly am sorry and repulsed by the way I acted but I'm afraid to apologize. I also really hate myself for stealing my friends' things. I honestly had a fair amount of great friends over the years I treated like sh*t for no reason sometimes, especially behind their backs. I'm afraid to go outside, I spend all my time on the computer and I hate myself for it knowing that I'm going to look back on my teen years like this. Do you think i deserved everything I've gotten? I really just want to die. I've had enough, someone makes a nasty remark at me each day, even strangers. Guys give me dirty looks on the bus and a couple times they go to sit beside me, see my face and then quickly move to another seat. Even when I go to a family pool party I hear it because my cousin is there and has to retell the story about me stealing her things and sh*t in front of me to her bf just to piss me off. I'm a better person now and obviously I've learned my lesson. I know karma doesn't exist.. but I really hope that I never made anyone feel as bad as I've felt the past year. I can't go a day without crying. I just don't have any motivation to do anything, my social anxiety is terrible, I'm empty and depressed, I don't care about anything. I never have fun and it hurts. I feel like it's never going to get better living in this area of my city. I'm too awkward for a job please give me advice i actually have been thinking about suicide a lot"
386,"A day that everything broke down to pieces, and I need a tiny glimpse of hope.","I am shocked to learn that I am a violent person from this day on, it is everything that I was against, and now I realize that I am this pathetic thing."
387,my girlfriend is threatening to hurt herself,"has been doing this for the past few weeks. last night she went off the deep end and stated she has nothing worth living for anymore. that no-one cares about her, etc... said she was going to end it and that she just wanted to talk to me one last time. I kept telling her to stop saying that stuff and that people care about her. that not only me, but her family as well, and her best friends. I told her let's talk about this tomorrow more but she kept insisting she was serious this time. she said ""bye"" and haven't heard from her since or all day."
388,Please help me understand,"Please help me understand HOW someone can go purchase a gun and pull the trigger on themselves in the head. Just how? how bad it must be? how desperate? how dark of a place one can be in? how helpless? how heartbroken to go through with this without reaching out to anyone. I just want answers please help me understand. My heart is broken for someone dear to me. I wish he knew he was dear to me. I wish he believed it that he was dear to someone even if it was 1 person. I wish he had reached out. could I have stopped him? i cannot stop feeling so sick in my stomach thinking about the the pain he must have been going through to do such a thing. i wish i could reduce his pain. I wish he had allowed me to reduce his pain. could i have reduced his pain? my heart, my soul aches."

My parents hate me theyve told me my mom says if my mom and dad get a divorce ill be the reason why im just a up i dobt deserve this life im a waste of skin... Why cant i just die already!
390,Too Retarded to stay alive,"The reason I had so many failures in my life is because I'm so retarded. That explains why I never had any friends, never got married, never even had a loving relationship, having other successes in my life.. I don’t want to continue living like this anymore.. There's nothing to live for when I’m a total zero!"
392,I'm scared to do it...,"But I know I want to kill myself. I've known for a long time. I've tried to pull myself out of depression over the years, but I always end up in the same situation. I flunked out of college, not because I couldn't keep up academically (my scores were always higher than my peers), but because it was too hard to get out of bed most days."
393,"no hope, no future","I'm still in the same place I've always been, apart from now, I'm getting closer to 30. I'm doing very little with my life, I feel I've amounted to nothing."
394,"Young Attractive Guy, Only 19, I want to kill myself every day","First of all I am extremely grateful for everything I have. I have a nice job, nice resume, and I'm headed to Freshman year of college this fall. I'm only 19 and I still have my youth too."
396,Please let me help you,"My desire is to help those with emotional difficulties and death wishes. I have first hand knowledge of the grief of attempted suicide in the fact 3 family members attempted suicide. I was just 14 years old when the first occurred and 18 when my mom attempted not once but twice. The other attempts were 2 of my sisters. At the age of 49 I was planning my own but I wasn't going to just make an attempt. As a nurse I knew anatomy and it wasn't going to be a big deal. I felt the last resort for help was to let my adult children and husband know what I had in mind and that would save me, or at least make them aware that I was troubled. The result was that they blew me off. They seemed like they were scared not of my potential suicide, but of me, they stayed away. Not what I expected. My now ex spouse had shifted my children's perspective of me at very young ages, as he would ask them at times if it was 'safe' to enter the house as I was grieving over a family members death. Their response angered me to the point I buckled down and put my anger to work. I used a tool I had been using for others for years in my nursing career and it was the save for me. We call it a nursing care plan. We use it for patients to determine nursing problems, to identify our end goal and identify measures to achieve our result."
397,Lost the one person who I loved,was in a relationship for over 3 years my girlfriend was paranoid of me
398,Death won't come soon enough!,"I really hate being ""alive."" I have completely isolated myself. I don't have a single friend, I haven't had one in years. I don't have a relationship with anyone in my family anymore."
399,I just want to crawl in a hole and die.,"I do not know what to do anymore. Despite all the things going on In my personal life and dealing with so many issues emotionally, I have found myself broke."
400,unsure of what to do next,"Not really sure I'm putting this in right place, but just need to get things off my chest somewhere."
401,I cant take it nomore :(,"Well this is it i feel like i cant take it no more. Every time i try talking to someone or to my family they just ignore as if i don't exist. so many people ignoring me and i have build so much stress and anger in me i cant take the pain no more., i just think the only way to cure this is to just take my life away and just leave this world. i get bullied a lot by my brother when he knows im sad he just hits me or bothers me and i cant take this pain no more. i need help really soon or its over for my life. please i need help!. i smoke weed every night just to not think of my problems! pleaaase help me i don't want to leave this world i know there is a brighter future than the life i am living now!"
402,im 17 and i just want to die,im 17 and i just want to die.
403,Cry for help or just giving up?,"Most people who read this might be thinking, cry for help, giving up or just a whinging woman."
404,please someone care about me,I want to die. I am treated like a disease by everyone i know. How can i be such a bad person? I am cursed. My family even abandoned me. I dont want to be alone. I am no a bad person but i feel like i should kill myself. Even when i do good things i get punished for it. No one ever thanks me for things i do for them. I get blamed for everything bad that happens. Please oh god please someone care about me
405,My Problem... URGENT.,I think I may possibly need help...? It's hard to figure it out when it's me.
406,This isn't a life!,"I absolutely don't have a life. Most of my weekends are spent at home. Every since my ex cheated and left me to get engaged to the person i caught him with i've had these episodes of depression that only seem to get worse. I'm in and out of counseling, my doctor wrote me a prescription for celexa which i won't take because i keep hoping things will get better but they don't. Everyone says "" you're beautiful and have a lot to offer and u shouldn't have a hard time meeting people"" but i do and whomever i allow in my life man wise tossed me like a piece of trash or ignore me for no reason. It hurts when people do this and makes u feel like nothing. I''ve called suicide hotline on different occasions and to me its not helpful. I've said on several night before i go to sleep that i hope i don't wake up to experience another empty day. I have nothing to come home too and no where to go! Whats the point anymore?"
407,Sad/Angry,"About 4 months ago I cheated on my wife. This goes against everything I thought I stood for. To say I was stressed, and overwhelmed with work, family, and general life stresses at the time is an understatement, but it happened. I told her the next day because I was disgusted with myself. Since then, I've gone to counseling and tried to better myself. For some reason, she is working through it with me. I'm certain if it wasn't for our three young kids I would probably end it for her because she deservers better, and so do my kids. Since then, I have been so sad, and generally angry at myself and everything around me. I hate what I did, feel bad for my wife, and feel like a fraud of a father and husband. On top of that, for years now I have been worrying about everything - how will my kid's lives be like, will they be happy and well off, will my wife and I have enough money to retire, etc."
408,"All I really wish to do tonight is kill myself... But who would care, right?",Please help me
409,I'm losing reasons to want to live anymore and I can't take it.,"I'm 15 years old. I know that's rather young but already I feel like I've been through so much. I lost my father on Christmas this past year. He was all I had. I lived with my mom because during the time they were separated , so I only saw him about 2 times within the last two years he was alive because of her, before he unexpectedly passed. I'm in a scholars academy and I do very well in school but lately my grades have been going down with all this stress. Not only am I having to bare the loss of my father when he was only 52, but I now loving with my physically and emotional abusive mother who I feel has undiagnosed schizophrenia- erotomania. I've done a lot of research. Long story short my mom believes there are cameras in the house and microphones by a celebrity she stalks and ""is in love with"" so she walks around the house talking to herself (while she feels she's talking to him) while in lingerie. She hits me and fights with me terribly if I say something out of line because she thinks the purpose of me saying it is so that it'll cause him not to like her anymore. This has been going on for 13 months and there's so much more to the story but I just can't go in detail. It's horrible. During the time my dad died I had to deal with his death while she was crying that the celebrity hasn't called her yet. I'm so miserable. Having to deal with my deceased dad, insane mom who I love and I hate to see like this, i had a boyfriend of two years who left me and had sex with another girl the same day he went. I was numb. I wasn't even sad, I just went numb. Months later I met this new guy and we dated and he left me just as easily. I'm not trying to sound like the typical broken hearted girl, I don't want to kill myself over the recent break up. But when I had the last boyfriend I almost saw my dad in him. It's difficult to explain. He knew everything that went on with my mom and her craziness too so i feel like i have no one. Hes entirely ignoring me. Blocked me on everything. Just with everything piled together I feel like I can't take it anymore. I wake up in the morning all the time wishing I hadn't, the mornings without a doubt are farby the worst for me. I just lie down for hours thinking of ways to kill myself. During the day I'm better, sometimes I randomly hit a low and it's weird. At night I'm okay but not best. I just sit and cry, I shake, I scream, I'm always thinking of ways to end it and I feel like I'm going to break. I can't describe how I feel when I get my low. It happens randomly but it's so scary. I know what happens, not just what goes on in my mind. I have a fit. I don't know how I feel. I never remember why I was so upset after. All I know is I'm so tired of feeling like this, I'm tired of reaching out for help. I just don't want to be here anymore and I've lost hope in even trying to feel better. Everything ends in pain or death so I feel hopeless"
410,Hurting so bad,"I feel there is no way to physically or mentally deal with the amount of pain I am in. my boyfriend broke up with me 4 months ago. I had been dealing with an illness and the medications and stress caused me to be cranky and unlike how I had been with him prior. I was also overall just feeling very insecure since I was losing my hair due to the medications/treatments and stopped seeing him. I would feel so so guilty about being selfish and not seeing him at this time, but I felt that if he saw me in that state he wouldn't stay with me..of course that would mean he wasn't worth it anyways but all logic had gone out the door during the time of my illness. I have told him how deeply sorry I am for those months I have cried my heart out but he claims he just can't feel for me anymore. He has made it clear as day that he does not love me or care about me. I lost all my friends while I was with him. And just got completely absorbed by the relationship. He was my everything and I trusted him with every ounce of my heart. He has means of getting out of the house and friends to grab lunch with, while I have no one. Everything I looked forward to while fighting cancer was/had to do with him. I try to go on walks and hang out with my little brother (when I can as he doesn't live with me nor does his mom anyone near him) but I still feel hopeless. I have been praying every single day for strength to overcome this but as each day goes by I feel angry at God for taking my best friend away. I haven't been able to do my homework or study I'm near failing my classes and as much as I try to pick myself up I fail. I feel so angry at myself for being this pathetic. He was my entire happiness. I just want to end my life than continue going through this. Seeing how perfectly normal and happy he is makes me wish I could be just half as strong as him. I have been in a relationship before, I went through a lot with him, but I never loved someone this much or invested so much into someone. I have never felt this horrible and helpless. I am tired of myself for loving someone this much who doesn't love me back"
411,I think about killing myself a lot but don't think I'm depressed.,"Hi, new here so I hope im not breaking any rules or anything."
412,This is it,I am homeless
416,My experience with suicide and why you shouldn't attempt!,"I grew up in an emotionally abusive household and suffered various traumatic experiences that hindered my social development and especially my self confidence. My father was a strict disciplinarian and very restrictive. I was never really allowed to develop as individual until I became an adult and managed to acquire freedom. Due to this I had minimal interests and had no idea what to do with my life. I am (and was) intelligent, attractive, and physically fit (at least when I maintained it), but despite this I felt hopeless and despaired constantly because I had no self confidence and viewed myself as worthless (due to basically being told so constantly as a child)."
417,I need a new purpose,"I was born with depression. I've experienced happiness but never reliably. Survival demands that I keep finding jobs and paying rent, but after a couple days or a couple years I stop caring and just sleep instead."
418,Help...Ii broke something,"There is this girl who is kind of my friend with benefits, she broke up with her boyfriend three months ago and I am done with love. We haven't had sex but we have been really close several times. Yesterday we were in her car and she stopped me because she had sex once there with her ex. I told her it didn't matter because we were just going to touch and stuff but she was convinced something else was going to happen. I tried to prove my point by testing her willpower so I kissed her and after a while she stopped me again. I was happy because I thought I had proven that we were able to stop. I tried to kiss her again and she was trying to avoid it but I kept trying. Then all of a sudden she starts crying. I was shocked, I didn't know what to do. I apologized repeatedly and when she calmed down she was a different person. She told me she felt something broke inside of her but she didn't know what was it. Then She just lied there and began talking about her life being worthless and that she would always stay with me in my heart. When I realized she was talking about suicide, I panicked. I apologized again and I tried to convince her she was a wonderful person and I was the fool. She looked awful like a body without soul, I couldn't help crying and then she reacted a little. I held her and then help her up. I told her to believe me when I said she was wonderful, then I told her that together we were going to be alright . She seemed a little better but only a little. I had to go so I left her. I texted her yesterday and today, she didn't answer. I read she posted something on facebook several hours ago, it was a normal post. I hope she is ok but I don't know for sure. She is usually online at this time but not tonight. I texted her and there was no answer. I am scared. I don't know what I broke and why did it break. I feel so bad. It feels as if I had raped her although that is not true because once she started crying I apologized right away. I need help please.!"
419,Considering Killing Myself,"I'm 24, I have a good job. I'm a pretty good looking guy, I live in one of the most desireable places to live in the US. I am personable and can make friends pretty easily. People think I'm funny and I am very musically talented... I know this stuff... But I ****ing hate myself. Why??!! I don't understand. One thing that really gets to me is woman. My whole life I've been terrified to make a move on girls because I have 0 confidence in myself even though I have so much going for me. I've been told I could get any girl I want if I made a move... But I will not make a move because I just feel like why would anyone want to be with me if I hate myself. The problem is I don't understand why I hate myself. I have no reason to feel this way. It's affecting my relationships with friends, my happiness and everything. It's like I have the whole world infront of me with so much potential and I just have this ball n chain that I can't break loose from. It's so frustrating I just want to ****ing scream at the top of my lungs."
420,just so tired,"I feel like running away. I think that is my only other option from suicide. But I think the consequences of getting caught of running away are worse than the consequences of a suicide attempt or failure. I just feel so hopeless. I don't think I have a future. I can't imagine myself ever being in a relationship, or getting older. I don't feel like I belong here. I don't belong with anyone. It's like I think completely different from everyone. I act different. I am different, too different so I'll be alone forever. I feel anxious, like I need to do something. I workout and try to be.preoccupied during the day but as soon as I have a moment of silence I think about dying. I dream about it, someone killing me, a car crash. I just really think everything sucks, for lack of a better word. I don't know if I hate everything, or just myself."
421,how pointless is my life really?,"I am 19 and I feel like my life is pointless. Eventhougth I have a wonderful daugther and I know what I want to do with my life career wise. I just can not get myself to be happy or to want to be happy. Tonight is not the first time I have thought of killing myself and when i do i feel good or like its funny when i know that it is wrong. I don't understand how i can not want to see my daughter see her teen parent finish school, or show the people in my life that my mistakes did not hold me back, or jus tlive for myself. that should be enough but its not i have been sad for the last 6 years and i should end it tonight. But my daugther is going to find me"
422,if this was you..?,"I've recently told a friend about how I feel and I'm a little worried. So if a close friend said they planned on killing themselves, just not anytime soon, would you tell someone? I pretty much told her about wanting to die but I wouldn't try to kill myself (again) until I'm an adult, which is a little over a year away."
423,I've been toying with the idea of suicide,"It pops up on the periphery of my mind. Not in a planned out 'i'm gonna kill myself this weekend"" way, but in a ""wouldn't that be nice"" way. In my mind death is like a great nothingness and I yearn for it."
425,"I've become a lonely, bitter, miserable person. I need help.","I've suffered from low self-esteem all my life due to a lifetime of being bullied and sexually abused. I am now 22, pursuing a postgraduate degree in Industrial Psychology, and relatively happy with my academic life."

I really think is time to give him the opportunity to maybe have someone better then me in his life. with love to my little angel Johnathan"
434,I'm done. I'm doing it tonight.,"I found out my ex it engaged to a girl he was friends with whilst we were together, I never liked her because she isn't a nice person. I lost my virginity to him and fell in love instantly. I spent 2 years planning our future, he told me he knew he'd marry me as soon as he saw me. Then one day a petty argument made him cut me out of his life completely. 4 months later and he is engaged. I found out earlier that the girl is pregnant. I threw up, had a panic attack and almost passed out. I was sobbing this morning contemplating cutting my wrists just because of the engagement, now the pregnancy. 4 months ago he told me I was the love of his life. Now she has everything I want. She has the part of him he told me was mine for the rest of my life. I feel dead anyway. I don't want to live my life without him and I don't want to exist anymore. This pain feels engrained into my skin. I ache. I'm going to cut my throat tonight. Then it will all end. I won't exist. I won't have to feel the pain and sickness of knowing my soulmate has chosen someone else. That I'm so worthless."

I'm not scared, i'mhave no fear in what I have planned, but I still know, deep down, I do not want to die. I know I just want everything to be ok, but I don't see it an option anymore. I don't want to tell a doctor or anything how bad i'm feeling, as if it got ignored, that would be it, I don't want people to think I just want attention, all I want is for everything that is going on to go away. I don't want attention, I want an answer to my problems."
444,Life is suffering,"I want to kill myself but i don't know how. I need to just end it. Dont give me quotes from the bible because im atheist. I dont fear the so called after life. I just feel that im not going to make a difference in this world. Life is bland and hurtful. All my life anybody who has ever loved me has left. They get sick of me but can i blame them? Everyone who knows me sees this ""Happy"" guy who is always telling jokes and making people smile. Its all just a mask. Im not happy at all. And no i dont want help, i dont want something to live for. Don't try to convince me, you will fail. All i need is the easiest and most effective way of suicide.

It was summer, I was madly in love with a nurturing and kind man and I found out I was pregnant. I also made the worst mistake of my life that summer; I had an abortion. My boyfriend looked me in the eyes before the procedure and held my hand saying ""never again."""
453,I want to end it.,"To whoever reads this,"
454,...would it really be that wrong?,"A couple of months ago, I was dead set on that I wanted to commit suicide. I was a mess. An emotional blob that couldn't handle anything anymore. I have started to get better, am doing well, I am looking forward to this life I could have, but I still don't feel far from that longing to want to attempt suicide again. I feel tempted to do things, stupid things, overdoses, running away, disappearing from where I am. I can see the life I want, but I also see this longing to want to end my life. Would it really be that wrong to die? I know its not right, but its a means to an end. I went onto a psychiatric ward last month, since coming out, my support has reduced significantly. I now have no one I can talk to properly, I was not referred to anyone on discharge from hospital, I've been left to go it alone. I still don't see that everything can get better. I don't see that things can change. I see what I want, but I see hurdles that I can't get over. And no support. Maybe I should just give in? Maybe I should just accept I will never get better? I don't know. Confused and more lonely than I've ever felt"
455,"Do not do it, I tried, NOT worth it",I just came accross this forum and was scared when I first read about it. I attempted to take my life July 30 2011.
456,I want to end my life so badly!!!,"I hate being alive, I wish I could kill myself without hurting the people around me, it would make this so much easier. I just can't stand the thought of waking up tomorrow and the day after, I just want it all too end."
458,My Life Is. Cruel Joke,"Not sure why I'm bothering to write here anymore, no one really follows my post bout how I'm doing anymore."
459,"This isn't like me to come to an online forum, so please give me advice...","I would never in a million years think to go on something like this, but I'm just stuck in such a ****ing weird place right now and i have not the slightest bit of clue what to do. Im 19, told by my family I'm a failure bc i have lots of tattoos, 2 years into college and not to sure what i wanna do, struggling in mechanical engineering (because well its ****ing hard!) I have done a lot of ****ed up things in my life and things i should very well be shot for....i just moved backed in after 3 years of living with my ex (and well that was a stupid freakin idea) my girlfriend?best friend of 5 years just found out tonight i cheated once and it was when i was high off 60 mgs of perks and drunk as ****.....she also found out I've done just about everything under the sun, get high at work, drink every day with friends (which she was all fine with until she found out i was sneaking behind her back to get high)"
460,So Close,I realized how damaged i am and it's going to take the life of me to get up again.
461,Emotionally Exaughsted,"I wish I could understand what I want right now. I tell myself that I'm okay but then people say 'you've attempted suicide twice and you have more scars than believable.' I'm on medication and I'm doing what my family want me to do...'Get help' I see a psychiatrist. I scare myself. I know that when I wake up in the morning be it in a good mood or a bad mood that it will change and quite rapidly. I just wait for it to happen. I first tried to commit suicide when I was 13. I took an overdose and I didn't succeed. My mum was ill herself and her partner was horrible to me. He'd call me fat and then try and touch me...It wasn't very pleasant. For 7 years I watched my mum get repeatedly beaten up. I've been sexually abused by both a male and a female. I've starved myself. Tried to hang myself. And just yesterday I took another overdose. However, I stopped halfway through. Only taking 16 cocodamol and 4 paracetamol. I violently threw up and fell asleep on the stairs I had a blood test and I was fine (which was obvious) What I have noticed that I think is a bit odd is that whenever I have to get up to go to work I want to hurt myself in some sort of way so that I don't have to go..."
462,Just can't take much more,"I know I post alot on here but this is the only place I can go to try help me as I feel I cant really turn to my friends and family. I'm just so tired and servely depressed and the past 2 weeks just can't take the pain, tears, pressure anymore. I have come nearly 3 times already with a bottle of jack and sleeping pills I don't no were I can really turn anymore. I wake up with sickness for the past 4 years which I'm in hosptial every month which I have anxiety with as scared where I'm going to be sick I also suffer with problems with my hands. I have lost my flat what I brought me and my ex fiance and she gone off on a girly holiday she blanks me like I never existed and gets people to give me **** and boys to start on me and she seems happy as. My business is struggling to keep alive im trying to cover bills keep peoples jobs I really am losing everything in my life and struggling to deal with this I really can't take anymore, I'm trying to get better i see a cancellor, I go to the gym, I have medication but nothing's working I'm so lonely I can't take the tears anymore"
463,Mentally Dying,I've never really been one to reach out in forums but i really have no one else to turn too...
464,Anyone feel bored of life?,"Hi everyone, thanks for taking the time to read and I appreciate any input but first let me paint a background so you have an idea of whats going on =)"
465,Today,Today I will not blow my brains out. Today I will not blow my brains out. Today I will not blow my brains out. Today I will not blow my brains out. Today I will not blow my brains out. Today I will not blow my brains out. Today I will not blow my brains out. Today I will not blow my brains out. Today I will not blow my brains out. Today I will not blow my brains out. Today I will not blow my brains out. Today I will not blow my brains out. Today I will not blow my brains out. Today I will not blow my brains out. Today I will not blow my brains out.

Today I will not blow my brains out. Today I will not blow my brains out. Today I will not blow my brains out. Today I will not blow my brains out.
466,The End,"Once you are no longer to make the effort with people, when even sending a text is too much, when you realised that your whole life no one contacted you. Soon after your 'friends' will dwindle, some people will still need things from you, until an alternative source for whatever function you provide can be found. I am 31 and currently over half way through a course of state sponsored psychiatric therapy, i feel worse than ever, i am more alone than ever. I have pushed away the small portion of my family that care for me because i have known that one day i will be dead. Everyone else died or fell by the wayside."
467,ive been thinking about it more and more,im 35 years old.
468,I just want to end it all..,"I can't even take this anymore. I'm only 14, but i just don't even want to wake up most mornings. Through out my whole life, all i've had is problems. I've been getting bullied for 6/7 years now, and that's hard enough. Day by day i feel useless. I wake up feeling like i don't even matter to anybody. I can't talk to anyone about it though. A couple of years ago, i almost lost my mum to cancer and that messed my head up pretty badly. I almost lost my dad to it a few years before, and he's now getting tested for it again. The only thing that stops me ending it all is my dad. He's the only person that seems to care about me. I'm fed up of feeling small. I'm never happy, i haven't been for a few years. I just smile when around people so they don't ask. I really want to kill myself, but I couldn't do that to my dad, but i can't deal with crying every night. Please somebody help me? I want counselling, but i could never open up to somebody without falling about inside."

She was the one I wanted to marry and I don't see myself with anyone else. I can't motivate myself to do anything and I am having trouble finding happiness at all...all I really want to do is lay in bed. i have been drinking heavily to get by and my work has gone to * * * * .

474,Suicide when you are a mother,"I know I am being terribly selfish for even thinking of it, but often I feel that it would be for the best that I end my life."
475,Do you think these pills will do it?,"Not expired: I have 180 75 mg Effexor pills, a full bottle of dayquil, 18 1 mg Abilify pills, 20 9 mg Emsam patches, 34 25 mg Lamictal pills, 22.5 100 mg Seroquel pills, 73 10 mg Prozac pills, 3 40 mg Relpax pills, 20 200 mg Advil Migraine pills"
476,What Now!?,"Hi,"
477,Killing myself this week/Suicide advice that will result in suicide,"My name is Nate, and I'm planning to commit suicide within a few days"
478,I'm done,I've never felt so at ease with the idea of taking my own life. I figured I'd let somebody know since I can't put my loved ones through such a confession. Who cares what's on the other side (if anything at all). Even oblivion is better than this.
480,broken,"I just dropped out of school and lost my housing. I've had an eating disorder for 10 years and I've gone through treatment, but it's worse than ever before. I feel worthless and everyday when I wake up I just wish that I could be unconscious again. I drink to numb it all out, and take whatever pills I can get my hands on. I have wonderful people in my life who love me, but it doesn't make a difference. I keep on closing them out, and I don't know how to open up. I hurt myself because I feel like I don't deserve what I have; like I need to be punished. I feel broken, like I can't fix the part of my brain that doesn't work like it should. I don't know how to fix myself. I just don't want to be here anymore."
481,had a total breakdown tonight,"I was on the phone all afternoon with my state insurance program - we have ""Romneycare"" in Mass, and we have to have insurance. I have been unemployed for a year and a half, and my COBRA payments are $1825 a month, which I can no longer afford after 4 months of these draining payments."
483,"Never thought I'd be posting here, but..don't see the point anymore.","I'm not saying I want to kill myself right away, I'm not in that kind of anguish. I just don't really see the point in going on anymore really. I don't even have good reasons for it."
484,I'm not sure what else to do...,I found this website and decided why not ... I have no one else to talk to.
485,Attempting to Overdose or Starve To Death,Tonight i come to the conclusion i had a tough life and been through so much.
486,Is Death The Only Way Out For Me ?,"Tired of my depression, holding on to the things in the past and things i am facing today."
487,A Dear Friend and the Connection We Share.,"Hi everyone,"
488,Being stuck in the arm with a needle,Ever wonder what you would do if your best friend stuck you with a sewing needle everytime they saw you?
489,I just want to be mugged...,"I'm not into the whole killing myself, I want someone else to so it. I want a mugger to try and mug me, or a random car run a red light and just screw my world up. I want to be shot randomly, I want something to happen to me. Actually the whole being mugged thing is very enticing...."
490,So tired....,"I feel pain in my chest. I can't take this depression anymore... it gets me down and I feel I can't fight it anymore. I've felt suicidal 3 times in my life. After the last incident, I told myself never to go there again but it came back. I'm sick and tired of feeling this pain in my heart, in my chest. I just want to end it all and be asleep forever. Right at this moment, I'm coming up with the quickest, painless way to do it. I don't want to feel this pain anymore. I know it's selfish, but I'm so tired of losing sleep over my disturbed unconscious. I sit here and look back on what I didn't accomplish, of my failures. I feel I can't be strong any longer. The only solution I see is to end my life......"
491,so done,"My name is josh... I have been battling depression since I was 15... im 27 now... well I haven't really thought alot lately about much else than suicide... im a divorced/engaged soldier who up and decided I just couldn't do it anymore... im a weak person and have had nothing but problems since I joined... I have been blown up and since then my medical problems just kept rolling downhill... I have shattered my arm had two inguinal hernias a tumor in my foot my knees dont want to work and im constantly in pain... enough of the physical how about the mental... I was married for four years and was happy until I found out she cheated and since I had no proof I just lived with it. I have two little girls who have watched their mom beat daddy up on multiple occasions and watched me carry mommy up three flights of stairs drunk off her ass... now I've been in germany for two years and found a woman who I loved more than anything... well she has cheated and lied and put her hands on me as well but I've done some messed up thingsto her as well. She is a partied and likes to ""go out"" but gets text messages from random guys telling her they love her and all sorts of things... the very best part is she always has a stupid excuse... now let me explain she has a daughter and I love her deeply and left the army to stay home and help be with her because her mom has no one else ro watch her while she works... yes I just up and left... now I cannot leave the house for fear of getting picked up and failing my fiancé... but instead of understanding she started going out more and sometimes not coming home till 0900 or 1100 in the morning... now I have given up everything for this woman and I get nothing in return... im tired and broken down... im in so much pain physically and mentally that I just want it to be over please only SERIOUSE replys..."
492,I am a terrible person,"My ex scarred me deeply, I won't go in to it here but the incredibly short version is that she made me trust her implicitly before she cheated on me. I took her back and she did the same thing. I had known her and been close to her for six years. In a a serious relationship for just over a year. Despite what she did, I still love her and think of her every day."
493,My girlfriend wants to die.,"I have been with this girl for about a year or so. We've had troubles, but always got back up. However, all that effort may soon go to an end."
494,Mentally Unstable,I think about a few days ago i got on my knees and prayed that morning before work.
495,me,"I have suffered with depression for 1 &1/2 years. I have already taken 1 overdose, just because i wanted to sleep in peace."
496,Advice for those thinking of suicide - my personal story,My name is Kate and this time last year my depression truly began to take hold of my life. I wanted to die and I truly did not believe that I would be alive today. I'm writing this post as a year later I feel proud to be where I am now and I want to share my story with anyone thinking that suicide is the best way out. I also want to offer some advice. I'm not the best advice giver and I know that some of you may not gain any help from this post but I hope I can change at least one persons view in suicide.
497,Is life worth it?,"Hello everyone. I'm only 19 years of age, but I would say that I've been depressed for years now. You see, I've always wanted someone in my life who I can love and have them love me back. I'm not referring to family, but a significant other. I was indeed home-schooled throughout high school, and didn't have any interaction with my peers during those years. Perhaps due to this solitude I developed the idea that I'm an undesirable person."
498,"I may be delusional or ""crazy""",So I have been dating a guy that claimed to really like me. I really liked him. It was too good to be true though. I sensed he was lying and went to his house like a stalker. I knocked on the door. His father told me he was with a girl.
499,Death Seems Like an Easier Option,"I've heard the mantra - ""suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem."" I know to a certain extent, this is the truth. However, it has little effect on me. I've simply lost the desire to live. I just don't have the will to go on. Waking up every morning is such an intolerable grind. Sleep is when I'm at peace. But I know that deep down, every human being has self-preservation instincts, and I'm certain it's that aspect of survival that's stopped me from loading my grandfather's old pistol and putting it to my head. The way I feel now is a culmination of several events in the last four years that have worn me down."
501,Want to talk.,"I don't know if I am in the right place. But I have been feeling like there is no tomorrow for me. Not litterally, but I dont think that i can continue my life the way it's going. I am 20 years old, living at home with mom and brother and sisters. I feel like i have irreparably ****ed up my life. I am thousands of dollars in debt, and only have a GED, so getting a job, going to school, or saving money to do what i really want to do seems damn near impossible. I am always unhappy, except when i lived out with my cousin on the west coast. I moved away from home about a year ago, but had to move back due to an ongoing heroin addiction. I have never ACTUALLY considered suicide, thought about it many of times, but this is the first time i have actually thought it through. I dont know, im sure that i wont do it, i guess i am just looking for a little support as i cannot talk to my parents about this and i have no real friends. Thanks everyone."
502,Been at deaths door a few times already,"The love of my life left me 5 months ago after 2.5 years.I've been completely lost and broken without her. She was the most beautiful girl I've been with insider and out. She fell in love with me fast and her love for me opened my heart again and I fell head over heals for her. She made me a better man. She was 23 and I'm 30, SHE was the first to bring up moving in even getting married. As I fell deeper in love I too wanted all that she wanted for us."
503,Concerned about my friend,"Just before the new year I was speaking to my friend of over three years. They are in their 30's. They told me that this will be their final year, that they will getting their affairs in order and that they are tired of all the years of pain and suffering that they have gone through. My friend suffers with anxiety and depression. It has been debilitating for them. They have tried numerous medications but almost nothing has helped. My friend has told me in the past that they have not been suicidal since high school. I do not think that these things that they said recently were anything in passing. I take things like this quite seriously. We were supposed to chat on the phone but they told me that they were just not feeling up to it. This is common for this person. I have tried to probe further and asked if they meant what they said or if they were just having a rough day. They were quiet in their response. They said that they will tell me details later. Whatever that means. If they never meant it, they could have told me that they were just having a bad day. It seems like they won't open up to me and don't want to talk about it. Trust me I have not forgotten about it since."
504,"i need help , suicide is following me everywhere","I really need help, I'm considering killing myself tonight, these suicidal thoughts come and go but they always come back. Idk why I'm feeling this. Let me tell you bout my life. I live in Cali long Beach . When I was in 2nd or 3rd grade I was touched by an 19 year old. He was my cousins best friend and he would do it more than once and those thoughts would haunt me inside. I hate him for that . Since I was a little kid Idk what to do. I didn't know ifit was a good thing or bad. But now I do , and those thoughts of him touching me keep coming back. Well now he pays for my phone bill. But this might be why I am thinking if suicide Idk why. He touched me more than once "" I didn't know where to go or who to tell. He told m to not tell anyone or else. I kept it all to myself. Should I **** him up? Should I move on and let it go? What? I need help. Also my ex broke up with me last year and that didn't help at all. I wanna die so badly. I'm going to do it I just need a place to. Someone help me ;;(( . I have nobody to go to or to tell. I'm done with life. Its my time to go ' im over life. I just need someone. Someone anyone. Please. Also my uncle beat the **** out of me last year and socked ne in my head alot and almost knocked me out "" I am only 15. These thoughts run through my head all day everyday. I need some nyquil and drink that whole thing. Hopefully it will putbme to sleep. So i can never wake up Also I can't sleep or eat. I NEED HELP. No one understands how I feel right now. I can't open up to anyone. Its too embarrassing and I can't do it. I haven't told anyone about this. Just please help me. I'm ****ing up in school ' no one likes me. I want to go. I'm tired of all this pain. My brother beats ne up constantly. I have no where to turn to. Nobody to go or talk to. I can't stop crying. I'm a 15 year old boy. Idk if this is normal or not but I need help. Its killing me inside. I can't take it anymore. I tried cutting my wrists in 8th grade. Didn't help. Now I'm on to pills or downing some cough medicine. I need help ASAP. Nobody understads me. The person that touched my private still is asking ne to and he tries to but everytime he tries I sock the **** outta his face. All this is just not helping. Both my aunts died by cars and I feel the need to be with both of.them right now. Why isn't God taking ne. He has taken everyone else. why not me. I deserve to go. I need to go. I'm done. I wanna die"
505,I'm giving myself 100 days,"This week at home, with my family and friends, was ruined by my horrible job evaluation. My mom (a human resources manager) and two friends in human resources all said that my bosses handled my evaluation horribly but it was all I could think about. The failure half of this year has been. Family members asked how it was down here and I couldn't fake happiness, I told them it was horrible. Everyone I talked to, including my parents, said that I need to get out ASAP. My parents just said ""keep looking, something will turn up."" I cried the entire way to the airport yesterday, not wanting to come back to this hell I live."
506,Rapper recently kill himself over a break up!,Not sure if everyone heard about that and he post it on his twitter before he did it.
507,19 And already considered the easy way out.,"Okay, i have"
508,can't be who i used to be,Hi I have been having feelings of suicide for a while now.. I guess I'll tell my story
509,feeling hopeless about life,so many things are going wrong for me
511,I really feel like I'm losing it.,"Well.. I don't know anymore. I have to admit, the thought of suicide has passed through my mind several times now the past month/2 months. The root of the problem to put it really short is the girl who I loved more than anything broke up with me. If you would like more info you can skim some of the topics I've made here."
512,Information on Pills Overdose.,"I can't find this information anywhere. I need to know, what pills to take (combination if needed), how many,"
513,Repressed memory making me suicidal,"This may sound feeble to some but its dominating my thoughts. I am 21 and have lived a life to be grateful for, good friends, good marks at school, good jobs and a healthy sex life. However a memory that i never really forgot about has been playing on my mind for the last few months, and its driving me insane. When i was 7 i had a male friend (also 7) that i use to play with. I still see him time to time now and get on well with him but this is rare as we drifted apart from about the age of 10. I dont remember well but i re call an incident with both of us being interested in our private parts. I dont know how it come about but i remember us both kissing each others privates. I have nothing against gay people, but i feel disturbed because i know for a fact i have never had a gay thought or experience in my life. Im also sure hes not either, since he has had a girlfriend of 5 years now. From what i remember i didn't enjoy what we did, and it seems a very uncharacteristic for me to do even at the age of 7. I've managed to repress this memory for 15 years now, but for some reason in the last few months it has got to me. I feel dirty, and to an extent i feel like i lost my innocence that day. Im sure he has forgot and doubt that even if he does remember he has any intentions of telling anyone. But i feel if it was to come out, it would follow me for the rest of my life. The only person i have told is my mum, and she has told me that i was to young to know what sexuality was at that age (Which i know is true, because i remember it not being a sexual thing) and that although what i did was wrong, plenty of kids that age have probably done the same. She also claims that the boy involved was always quite a strange child, and that she thinks he probably instigated it. If i re call rightly, it was his idea but i still feel dirty for taking part. I also read somewhere that this happens when a child has been exposed to sexual abuse. I know i have never been, but cant say that he hasn't. And the fact it was his idea, suggests maybe there's a chance he has been, which makes me feel even worse about it. Im probably wrong, and it was more then likely a simple case of just two curious young boys not knowing what they were doing. I know it may seem stupid to some, but this is really getting to me and i feel like i have done something terrible, im finding it hard to cope at the moment and have been having suicidal thoughts . Is there anyone who can provide with some support about this? Please"
514,not sure if this is the right place to post this but here goes,"I work at a hospital for mental illness. two days ago i came to work and there was a patient missing, meaning our camera person was not able to locate her on any of the camera's we have set up to monitor our patients. I began to search for the girl, starting with her room, no luck. I began to move down the hall looking everywhere i could. I got to the women's bathroom, i knocked first and announced my presence before going in. when i came to the shower part of the bathroom she was there, hanging from the a vent in the ceiling tile. I sent the women i was with to alert the others and quickly jumped to the edge of the bathtub, braced myself with one leg on the chair she had used and with my left arm grabbed hold of her lifting her as i used my right arm to rip the vent out of the roof. i lowered her to the floor and began cpr. I am just a cna at this hospital, by that time the doctors and rn's had arrived to take over cpr so i vacated the small room so that they would have the space they needed. by the time the ambulance had arrived they had a pulse, but she was not breathing on her own. basically i need to get some things off my chest, i cant get the picture of her hanging there, her face, the coldness of her body, all these things that i cant get out of my mind. i haven't been having nightmares or anything like that but when im awake i constantly see it. Just wanted to share my story with you all. thank you for reading."
515,Seeking advice/help,"Hi everyone,"
517,Feels like being pushed over the edge,Year on from breakdown due to break up. I've managed to get myself together to give uni a second go.
518,Last message and good night and good luck,"I haven't killed myself yet and probably will never surrender to commit, but what am I living for? Nothing, absolutely nothing. My therapist can't help me although I think she empathizes my situation a lot. I attempted my first suicide when I was 8 because I saw what was coming as my future, and so far I'm almost right on the dot and wish I didn't become so angry at the world that I refuse to just give in and end my life and prefer to avenge and destroy the world along with me instead. I just have bad luck my whole life, and I'm not talking about losing in a game or have parents died when young. I'm talking about everything I tried so hard to get back up and start over and over and keeps getting knocked down again and again and again my whole 40 something years."
519,I have this friend....,"Its true, I really do have a friend who needs help. She plans on killing herself soon. I want to help but I am afraid if I tell someone she will only speed up the process. What would you tell a friend that is going to kill themselves in the near future."
521,Suicide,I have thought of commiting suicide a lot lately. Im tourted everyday at school. I have to cope but nothing works. Does anyone know a quick easy way to just end my life? Please Help.
522,Just want to leave this whole world,Seriously speaking i just want to die as soon as possible. I dont want to live in this world. Help me and tell me what should i do ?????
523,Fed up with life,"You guys have probably head this a million times before , I am fed up with my personal and professional life both aspects of my life suck , well my personal life sucks haven't got any female companion , my parents treat me like i am a kid I am 25 for goodness sake going to be 26 on christmas day never had sex , addicted to wanking got no-one to class as a close friend my family is broken , my only love is trance music and I've only been having once to amsterdam last june I go out with my friends my mum kind of harrases me saying where are you what time you coming i am fed up constant nagging I have to brothers or sisters maybe thats why she is doing it being over-protective I hate it with a passion."
524,Lost my last hope,"I met someone. And my depression lessened because I was with him. Spending weekends together, having a great time. I found out Sunday that he doesn't want anything serious and so I spent the last 2 months doing what? Being stupid. Now the one thing I had down here, the one thing I had in my life that kept me going and rethinking just ending everything is done. If you need the back story you can read my last two posts. But now I don't see any happiness. I'm going home for the holidays to see my family one last time and when I get back here, it'll probably be the end."
525,This is it. Its time,"Im at the end of my rope. I want to do something but I cant. In a strange way I want to die.. I think about my death and I am not scared of it, hell I welcome it. I love a man that I am finally dating after a year and a half of friendship. That is what I have. It doesnt matter anymore NOTHING DOES. I give myself until December 14th to get out of this. In a way this is my suicide note. I plan on checking this everyday. I had hopes and dreams but for the past year I no longer feel like i'm meant for this world.... I'm so tired of trying medicine, support groups, cutting and f it."
526,Life is meaningless,The suicide thoughts come up in my mind tonight. This is not the first time my spirit is down.
527,Do you agree or disagree??,"I admit it....I am one of the hundreds of thousand of millions of people on earth that have had suicidal thoughts in their past. I have never harmed myself, not even in my worst state."
528,I don't understand,"Why am I such a piece of ****? I've done nothing in my life but be nice to people and try and be generous and I just feel like the biggest loser and biggest idiot ever. If my mom wasn't so loving I would have killed myself long ago. I just wish i never existed. I want someone to put a bullet in my head and end this **** because if I were to do it myself my family wouldn't be able to cope. I have no excuse for feeling this way, I just always have and always will and I cannot take it anymore..."
529,"Boyfriend says he ""feels nothing""","So a couple of days ago my boyfriend of 8 months told me he is suicidal. He said he had a good childhood. He has a good job, his own apt, quality friends, and yours truly. We have a good relationship, it's not verbally or physically abusive or anything like that. So he literally told me he's not depressed and nothing's wrong in his life, he just feels ""empty"" and has no feelings good or bad. And because of this, he has been contemplating suicide. Any thoughts on this? I really don't know what to say to him about this, but I know from past experience that when someone tells you this you shouldn't brush it off like they're looking for attention, even if they are. What are your thoughts?"
530,Can't take it any more :-(,It's got to the point that it's too much for me.
531,I want to kill myself really really bad. I just want to die :(,this morning i woke up to my bank accounts being emptied by a creditor. they said they served me but i didn't get the paperwork. i tried to tell them that i didn't know they served me. i couldn't pay my credit card bill because i got laid off. i was unemployed for 2 years. well i been working full time and oncall and selling jewlerly on the side to try to make money and get my life in order. it wasn't enough now my bank account is empty and my rent check will bounch. i lost my sense of taste and smell a year ago due to allergies and stress. i even had surgery to try and gain them back because im so miserable but they never healed. now im flat broke and im still sick. i just want to die. i really really do im just scared that i will be in hell i want to die. please god kill me or somebody kill me.
532,How do you all do it?,"I don't know how people do it. How do people get through the day when everything is stacked against them? How do you just not give up to stop the pain of waking up each day to problem after problem? This past week has been the absolutely hardest. I found out the guy I thought I was dating wasn't actually dating me (he said he wasn't looking for a boyfriend right now). I spent a week at work where nothing was working in my favor, I was talked about as ""having some issues"" and I was treated like I don't have two degrees but just graduated kindergarten. My car had another problem with it and after speaking to my mom about being able to finance it, I literally collapsed to the floor to cry and couldn't find the strength to get up for 20 minutes. The only time this week that I was happy was going out with that guy again and spending the night. I know I'm setting myself up for hurt with him but he is the only thing down here that makes me happy. I've come so close to ending it this week... how do you get through it all just under the assumption that everything will be alright when you turn around and another thing has gone wrong???"
533,Don't really feel anything...,"I feel empty all day, every day. I've tried several different medications. I've tried therapy. I've tried diet changes. I've tried exercise. I've tried new hobbies. I've tried new doctors. I can't seem to find anything that works. What can I do to stop feeling this way? Things are getting worse and worse."
534,Leave a note or just disappear?,"Let me start by saying this isn't a ""cry for help"", attention play, or open forum for pity. I have spent years bearing the weight of knowing how broken I am and contemplating the solution and its ripples from all angles. This decision was not reached in haste or rage and as such was reached with resolve, however I am at a crossroads as to whether I should leave some sort of note for whoever happens to walk in to this room after I walk out. Considering I no longer really feel emotions and am unable to translate or communicate that emptiness effectively, and I really have nothing to say, the note seems pointless. Or, should I simply clean everything, donate my belongings to charity, and disappear with dignity. Thoughts?"
535,Another way out?,"So... I've posted on this website a few days ago, trying to get out what has been bothering me. While at the same time avoid giving out in depth personal details, yes I tend to do that. And in this I hinted around suicide. Which I believe went unnoticed, big surprise there. Anyhow. Basically I just get told to ""Get over it."" Which would be fine and dandy if it worked. So I'm just going to cut to chase, I've been thinking of killing myself for a long time. About 11 or 12 years. Of course, at first it was just curiosity, wondering what it would be like. But still considering, because really, how else should you feel as an 8 or 9 year old being told your a worthless little sh**, smacked around, neglected and all that fun stuff. Such as sitting in a room full of adults purposeful ramming your head into a wooden desk, busting yourself open, and somehow you still go unnoticed. Anyway, as I'm now 20, going to be 21 in December. And I feel pretty much exactly the same, the thought of putting a gun in my mouth and blowing my brains out makes me happier than thinking of what tomorrow will bring. People tell me I need to find God, which is a load of crap. I've been crying out to God my entire life. And what have I got to show for it? A bunch of baggage from my child hood and teenage years, no friends, never had a girlfriend, my father was an abusive drug addict who is now dead, my older sister doesn't give an ounce of crap about anyone in our family, my little sister straight up hates us, and the only person on the planet that I care about is being slowly, and painfully taken away before my eyes. I know my mother won't last much longer with all the heart and lung issues she has. But in my experience, God doesn't care, or he simply doesn't exist. So everyday I fantasize about buying a shotgun, finding a nice little secluded spot, and pulling the trigger. See? I've planned this out. You don't need a license to buy a shotgun, ammo is relatively cheap, and nobody is going to stop me. Pretty sad this is what I plan for while people tell I'm doing the right thing in life. Getting a job, living on my own. I even thought about college, what a joke. Anyway, I've blabbed on enough. Oh, and save the selfish speech, I really couldn't care less. Because when I think about that last moment and everything going black, and the never ending nothingness that follows, nothing else matters. At least I hope."
536,I dont understand,"I am 23 years old and I am a hopeless romantic, i've given my blood sweat and tears for everything I do. its been almost 5 years since i joined the army . i never claimed to be a good husband to my high school sweetheart but i didnt deserve what I got 2x over while i was deployed. after i finally got over my ex i decided to try to start dating about 6 months later and after almost a year of dating my current gf or whatever she is now i dont even know i found out has been cheating on me with a so called friend . all i feel like is that im not good enough and through the actions of others i truly believe it . i tried cutting my wrist but it hurt to bad and not just physical pain. i've been blown up and never felt that much pain. i just want it to be over i really do i find myself drinking myself stupid just to go to sleep hoping that maybe i wont wake up i cant concentrate i just dont know anymore im a absolute mess im tired of crying i really am and im sorry for wasting everyone's time with this post i just dont know"
537,Nowhere to Turn,"Hi all,"
538,I am so alone,"I am 42 years old and I have nothing. I recently lost my job, I cant find a man who doesnt just want me for a toy and I am majorly depressed. I want a baby and a family so bad but I am basically too old now and I cant find a decent man to save my life. I am alone. I have nothing. I know, I know, I have a roof over my head, I have my health, blah blah. I've heard it all. Things could be so much worse, yes. But things could be so much better. I see so many people happy with their families and I get depressed. Commercials about love and children and families make me want to cry. I honestly wish there was a magic pill so I could just disappear. I have very few friends and a very small family. They would get over it."
539,I just want to die..,"I've really had enough.. I don't tend to pour my life story out, but I really have.. 13 years old. 14 on the 25th of this month. Severe depression. My past was awful. I hate home. I hate relationships. I'd be better off dead."
540,I think it might be time,"I am tired of this life. Every day is constant pain, with no hope, no love, and no legacy."
541,What to do?,"What do you do when your a Freshmen who’s antisocial? What do you do when your struggling in a selective enrollment school and can’t transfer? What do you do when you miss your old friends you Never have time for because of school?! What do you do when you overhear your parents saying how Dumb you are and should have when to a different school? What do you do when you had good intentions of going to a selective enrollment school but fail and DISAPPOINT your parents? What do I do?!?! Can anyone tell me what the **** to do. Because I go through hell each day, and I cant figure it out and no one seems to cares! This is BULL I work hard to Fricking Fail and disappoint. Any one at all Know What To Do?"
542,It's the only rational choice,"I've posted before. Explained my situation. Things just haven't gotten better. I moved 1300 miles for a job that lied to me to begin with. I have education and experience under my belt but I'm treated like a college freshman. I now don't have health insurance until the beginning of the year because of mistakes and confusion with human resources, none of which are truly my fault. I wanted it not to get a check up, not to have my teeth cleaned, but to talk to a professional, to get me out of where I am emotionally. I have no one here. I am alone, even when around the people at work. Financially I can't get out of here, can't leave the area, can't interview anywhere else, can't be where my friends are. There's little to save from my paycheck to move, to interview, to get out of where I am. I'm just not happy."
543,Don't want to feel this way anymore,"I am only 16 years old but have been very depressed for about 2 years now, I feel down nearly all of the time and just sit alone in my room and cry, I feel like I have no one to talk to, I barely have any friends and the friends I do have arnt close ones, my sisters moved out and she was like my bestfriend, my dad lives far away and has just had another child so I feel he's forgetting about me and my mum just doesn't understand and I just make her cry too. I feel like I have no one anymore and that no one would even notice or care that I was gone, I have also just broke up with my boyfriend that I was with for 2 years Afew months ago. I thought I was happier without him because he was horrible to me and treated me like I was nothing to him. But I feel heartbroken and miserable like I'm need going to find anyone else, I have no where to go to meet any new people and just feel hopeless and constantly left out like I don't have a life or anything worth living for.. Stuck in a rut and don't think I'm ever going to be happy"
544,"Suicide, help!","Hi,"
545,Getting closer...,"After a lot of research, I have decided upon a method with a high effectiveness, but most available to me. I have drafted a goodbye note to my family, for whom I have become a burden, which only adds to my daily agony."
546,Wounded Soldier,"Reason i say wounded soldier, because i am a very strong person."
547,Death is knocking on my door!,"I decided, i am ready to go."
548,I want to just dissapear,I am always alone..even my parents don't seem to care. I don't understand why I'm so hard to
549,Dont want to live anymore,"i just need a way out, i dont want to live in this world anymore, people tell me 'your 15 you have my whole life ahead of you' i dont want to have my whole life ahead of me i just wanna die, now. please someone help me i dont know what to do??"
550,Would it really be selfish for me to kill myself?,"Ok, so my mother who is now in her mid 50s recently lost her mother a few months ago. With that being said, I have seriously considered killing myself in the past. While I am not suicidal at the moment, there are times when I get extremely down because I am such a freak. Now, I realize that some of you guys on here will try to consule me about my situation, but that simply does not change my circumstances. Guys, I am a 31 year old man who has never had a gf, is still a freaking involuntary virgin for crying out lout, and am still working on my undergraduate because of my foolish decision to join the U.S. Marine Corps when I was 18. Anyway, I am just curious as to whether or not it would really be selfish for me to kill myself due to the fact that I am a 31 year old male virgin who has never had a gf before. Guys, I realize that it is very easy for you to sit there and say that I am the problem and that it is NOT the city in which I live is the problem. If that is the case, then why does the Colorado Springs Craigslist rants and raves board always have complaints from guys about women and the dating scene where I currently live? On that note, I realize that I will eventually graduate from college and will move to a new city, but that will still not change the fact that women will not find it acceptable that I am a 31 year old virgin who's never had a gf even though they will, in all likelihood, be much more down to Earth versus the women in the city in which I currently reside. I'm serious guys, I would rather kill myself than to live to reach my 70s and die alone. It is REALLY looking as if it is my fate to die as an old man who was rejected by women until his death. That fate is simply unacceptable to me guys. Again, in light of what I just told you, would it REALLY be selfish for me to off myself in terms of leaving behind a mother and sister who care about me?"
551,Hang Self From Tree or Overdose.........,I just been so stressed lately and the depression has been going on for quite some time.
552,Failed scuicide 4 times and now Im determined,So I dont really want people knowing who I am or that Im going to attempt again only that i tried four time years ago and failed.
553,"I want to Die, but I don't want to hurt my only friend...","My mom has been negligent of me ever since I was I baby. She basically locked me in my room when she couldn't deal with my pain... and she had therapists raise me rather than doing it herself and bonding with me. I've been betrayed, sexually assaulted (and the guy STILL has girls who adore him, including my former best friend, who knows what he did to me). As a result I have trouble making friends and trusting people. I posted a reply to someone with the whole story so if you want to see the whole thing to the thread by Lulzsec and go to the fourth page."
554,What is the right thing to do?,"To start off, I want to state that I've lived in an immensely privileged life. I grew up with a loving family and my life doesn't explain why I feel the way I do now. I'm 18 years old, attending college at a prestigious university and I have failed. I will not be able to return to the university the following semester. My girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me 2 months ago and I still cannot get over her while she simply moved on. I feel like my life is in shambles, like I've disappointed everyone who was proud of me. Like even I can't make myself happy,thus I have been thinking of suicide, not because its the easy way out or because I want attention, but rather because I question if I deserve to live. There are much stronger people in the world, who have put up with more and thrived in more. Do I deserve to continue to exist if I cannot deal with the easy problems of a privileged life? Maybe it's better for society and the gene pool of humanity if I just disappear. There are very few people who care about me, those who do all being family members. I'm not naive enough to think that my death would not cause more problems for the small amount of people who know me and the smaller amount who care. However, I think about the financial troubles my death would ease and it makes suicide seem like a better option. Yes, I have two smaller brothers and my death would affect them immensely, but I spent my time with them teaching them to accept change in their lives and to always strive on with inner strength, because I don't want them to be like me, without the will or strength to get through every day. Now I get back to the question of how to handle my situation. Once my family sees my failure in college, they will never accept me again, and I begin thinking of suicide rather than living a life where the few people who care about me begin to resent me. Is it alright to think about suicide every day? Is it okay? Should I just end my life? I've established that I don't have the will or strength to continue and not only would everybody who cares about me be fine, but be better off? To clarify, I'm not thinking about suicide because ""everyone would be better off without me""(be that as it may) but because I don't have the will to continue; I admit it, I am acting selfishly and cowardly,but I am being honest to myself for once that I am not strong enough nor worth enough to continue, and that's what scares me. Thus it begs the question what is the right thing to do?"
555,Why?,"I was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder when I was 12, now I'm 21, so I'm used to telling myself that I'm probably jjust depressed and that I shouldn't make any rash decisions while feeling this way. But this is different. I feel almost blank. I have considered suicide on a near-daily basis for the past eleven years, but I've always found a way to hold on. Whether it was fear of death, or waiting til I tried something that I wanted to do, I've always held on, obviously. But I don't feel connected to anything anymore, I don't see this step I'm about to take as anything significant. I 'know' that this will hurt my family, but somehow I feel as if I don't 'know'. As if I've lost the capacity to feel."
556,Waste of life,"I think I've truly hit rock bottom... Not financially... But in life. Or I've already hit my peak, and its time to check out. There aren't to many days I don't spend alone... Drowning myself with alcohol... I don't have one friend left, infact I pushed pretty much every friend I've ever had away from me about 2 years ago. As for family... I was always kind of a black sheep... I may talk to someone in my family maybe 1-2 times per month for 3 minutes on the phone. There isn't a day that goes by I don't feel like a useless waste of f***ing skin... And really I have felt depressed for the last 3 years. I find it hard to smile... There's just no reason to smile anymore, or anyone to share it with... Did I mention I've also become severely antisocial over the years. I can't stop and talk to someone for two minutes, soon as I get in a conversation I'm looking for a way out. My mind goes completely blank... And I start having anxiety attacks."
557,Very scared,"I was with a woman for over 2 years, living together for about 2. I did everything in the world for this woman, and loved her with every bit of my heart. I never was abusive, and I never cheated on her, and I had done things that for here that I have never done for anybody else. only to find out she had been cheating on me, and she left me on Christmas Eve for the guy she had been cheating with. I was so distraught that I didnt even spend the holidays with my family. I had never felt so used, so small, or had such a feeling of emptiness. I am a very private person, and very rarely let my feelings be known, and I always thought of myself as being very strong emotionally, but I just couldnt hide all of this. People had never seen this side of me before, and I had never felt so weak. I tried to stay strong, and drug myself into work everyday, and then forced myself to go out on my nights off, and even started reading the breakup forums here, but nothing i did seemed to help. I began having anxiety/panic attacks again (which I havent had in years), and began to drink myself stupid. I tried different antidepressants, but they only seemed to make things worse. My job reminded me of her (I got the job while we were together), and I just couldn't take it anymore and quit, then I started drinking full time. I have never in my life felt such anger towards somebody, and I was really very scared that I was gonna hurt both him and her. I finally got to where i felt like I could control my feelings when I was around other people, and I hid everything for about 2 months. Just this past week every feeling I had been feeling since the breakup have come back x10."
559,i wish,i wish i had the guts to already end my life.
560,I find suicide interesting,"I'm being very serious and wanted to see if anyone else feels this way too. I am fascinated by people who have committed suicide and I enjoy reading about the lives they led, etc."
561,"A sick life, a saved life, a useless life","I found out two years ago that I was very sick with something that the doctors in my country don't recognize as an illness because it is gender specific and there is no research regarding gender specific illnesses here. I have always been taken advantage of by doctors and by family and friends, mostly because I was always ""out of it"". I have never been able to find the man of my dreams, have the friends I wanted to have, have the education I wanted or the family life. I have always been treated very badly at home by my mother who is mentally ill but mostly doesn't care about anyone but herself and is an oscar winning actress. She has managed to single handedly ruin my life and has gathered other family members to promote hatred to me. My former illness is brought on by stress, like all other illnesses. THe problem is that I was always told that there is absolutely nothing wrong with me, I am very healthy, or I am very sick and was taken advantage of. The illness affected my memory, my motivation, my life in every way. I had no idea that I was so sick. In this country they just remove organs and dispose of them without fixing the problem and it only makes people more sick. I have had so much trouble with work, no employer wanted to hire me because my skin was so pale that my lips were blue. I was so sick and when my dad passed my mom swindled all of my money from me. I had nothing left. I had to live with her, but that's the reason that she did it, she could care less about getting help for her own problems and always said that I was the one that was sick in the head, she just aims to hurt me and takes pleasure in my pain. She makes a point out of causing me so much grief that I shake from the stress and she just smiles and laughs, and punches herself in the breast then tells everyone that I am the one hurting her. Everyone I've ever known has told me to get away from her and out of her clutches, but I have given her all of my money and still continue to live with her 10 years later. She made it so that she owns everything and"
562,I feel I need to die,"DISCLAIMER: This thread is going to be nothing but me whining. It's going to be very long. I don't expect anyone to care, as it would be unfair of me to do so. Nobody has to read it, or reply to it if they don't want to. I'm well aware I'm a wreck, but I felt the need to vent and get some if this stuff off my chest, not that it helps much. I know I need professional help, but I cannot afford it, and I don't trust it, so this is all I have."
563,Researching suicide,I have no hope left. My life has become daily torture. I blew all my chances at life and now I'm nothing but a waste. The pain is unbearable.
565,I'm in a really dark place right now,I’m in a really dark place right now and I am thinking of seriously killing myself sometime in the next 24 hours. There is so much I want to say right now but my mind is in a fog and I feel like I’m not expressing myself properly.
566,An Empty Mind,Every day for the last three months I have been constantly plagued with thoughts of death as the only desirable future.
567,Losing Hope,"I have been depressed for four years. But now, its hitting rock-bottom. For a while, it was improving. I had people to help me, a game to turn to when I felt like cutting, and a place to go if things got really bad. But now, I don't have anything. I don't have a laptop anymore (my parents took it), my boyfriend is ignoring me and giving every excuse to not talk to me, and my friends have their own problems. One of my fiends told me to 'suck it up and move on' while another has a teen pregnancy to deal with. My parnts are no help, they tell me to deal with it, and delight in telling me how fat I am ( 5 foot 2 and 145 pounds), how Im useless, and Im just a one-upper. I'm losing hope, and every day is a strugle against a losing battle."
568,why do i feel so sad,"im 13 and i cut, i always feel like nothing, a nobody, i think it waould just be easyer to end it all , yu know wt i mean? plz if anyone has anything to say to help me plz do, and NO, I WILL NOT GO TO AN ADULT, so if yur going to say tht dont even waste yur time, i wont read it."
569,Has anyone here attempted suicide?,I'm curious what your experience was.
570,why??,"I am having a hard time trying to get the thoughts of ending my life out of my head.I am 35 and got into a bad car wreck 2 years ago and my life has been going down.I cant work and support my family,I can stand to be around people anymore.I don't know what to do anymore.My doctors have all told me I can not be fixed and keep giving me pills.I stopped taking the meds and am accepting the pain so i can at least feel something.I feel lost and i am so tired.I don't know if it is worth even trying anymore.I don't know why i am posting this,I guess I am trying to get this off my chest before I decide how to do it."
571,Need help! Feel like I have no value,It's been a bit of a rough year. My long term relationship broke up and I lost friends from the break up. I'm in my last year of study but am really hating it and don't have many job prospects. It's ultra competitive and there's a lot of pressure - my head is just all over the place right now struggling to get through the workload.
572,How long should one wait?,i wrote my suicide note when i was 23. i decided to wait until i was 40 - in deference to those who would say
573,I am scared and scared.,Hey everyone thanks for reading this....
574,How can I be helped?,"I think that there is no point to life. We all end up dead eventually, and careers and hobbies are just completely pointless acitivities to keep ourselves busy. I think it doesn't matter if you accomplish a goal or anything you desire to do because the feeling of satisfaction from having accomplished that goal will wear off eventually and you will set up a new goal for yourself."
575,Shall I bother to live on?,"For over the past 2 years, my parents have said that I am a total failure in their family and that my sister is perfect. In my GCSEs I had only 1 a* 5a 2b 1c and in As level I started off well with 2As and 1 B but at the end of the year, 1B 2C. From this, my parents have continuously shouted at me saying that I am an idiot, I am a failure, I have betrayed them, I am a liar because I say to them that I will do well but I don't before and after the exams. They hit me, curse at me, say that I might as well be one of those performing dwarfs in circuses ( I have a medical condition called achondroplasia )."
576,.,I quit.
577,Stop & read this PLEASE.,"Today is National Suicide Awarness day. I know you all feel like there's no way out but there is. I didn't think there was either. I went through everything for about a year, but everything got better! You are so beautiful and have so much to live for. Everything happens for a reason. You happened, you have a purpose. You may not know what it is yet, i still don't know mine and it depresses me.. But we have one. Who cares about the stuck up *****es that are making you feel like this? They're not worth your time. It's your life. You can overcome whatever it is you're going through. Message me whenever. I love you all. <3"
578,"I REFUSE to give up, who the f are you denial my place!! What keep you going?",What keep you going and moving forward?
579,I'm A Hapless Loser,"I feel like I'm a worthless loser. It seems like everywhere I look, people are richer, happier and more successful than me. Very few things make me happy. As a testament to how pathetic my life is. I considered going to yesterday's New York Giants game as one of the happiest of my life. I have lost all my family, am burdened by so much and just wish it would end. I don't want to die, I really don't. However, being alive reminds me of how terrible I am. I know some of you can relate to this. Thanks for listening and reading."
580,Killing myself would solve everything,"I am lonely, I feel bad about that, if I kill myself I no longer care how sad and lonely I am, so ill no longer feel bad about it"
581,Why does my heart feel so empty?,I don't know why I feel so numb about everything but I think I know when it started.
582,tonight is the night,I just got done typing up a goodbye letter for my wife. If my son has questions about his father when he is older then perhaps she can use it to provide some insight.
583,I just need a place to empty my brain..,"I just wrote a very large post, for about and hour and a half. My laptop ****ed up and its gone. The post said everything ive felt since I was 14.. Whats the point in writing it all out again?"
584,Hello,"I'm currently 17, almost 18. My grades used to be quite good. (A's and B's) However, we had some family issues when I was younger which caused my parents to yell at me. I wasn't used to this and it upset me quite a bit. My grades suffered from it. The chain just wouldn't stop. Everytime I tried to get my grades up i'd get demotivated. Whenever I brought a bad grade home I always got yelled at. To this day it still happens. I have asked my dad kindly to stop yelling and lower his tone. He doesn't listen. The nonstop mental stress has caused thoughts of suicide. I have completely disassociated myself from society. I've lost nearly all my friends, I don't know how to speak to people I don't know. I am constantly terrified of making mistakes. I feel as if he's ruined my childhood.. Has anyone had any similar personal experiences? Any advice?"
585,I need help. Or something. I don't know. I don't know what to do.,"I'm a seventeen year old girl. I don't know what to do anymore. I want to leave. I want to be done. I don't want to be here. I don't think I can do this anymore. I don't want to go into all of the things that are happening and have been happening. I don't want to be here. I don't know what to do. I want to runaway but I have nowhere to go. I want to leave. I hate myself. I hate the way I look. The way I am. I hate everything about myself. I feel like such a ****ing failure. A disgrace. My mom can't deal with me anymore. I can hardly deal with me anymore. I beat myself up everyday for every mistake I have ever made. Things have been so hard and painful my whole life. I don't want to keep going. The only things keeping me here are my dreams. But I don't feel like I can even make them come true. That hurts so much. I don't want to be here if I can't do what I've always wanted to do. I don't want to be here. I don't have any friends anymore. I've missed out on every ****ing highschool event. I go to a small charter school because I'm too anxious and unstable to handle a public school. I've been in and out of treatment and schools since sixth grade. I feel like such a ****ing loser. I'm still in the process of getting my license...I don't have a job I feel like a pathetic ****ing waste of space. I feel like a whiny, pathetic ****ing piece of **** for even doing this. My eating disorder is ramping up again. I just got out of a residential place specifically for eating disorders in July. Things were getting better until school started. It's my senior year. I'm missing three credits. I lost all of my friends from school. I'm ****ing infatuated with this teacher at my school. It's so painful. It hurts me so deeply when he walks by without looking at me. I feel so ****ing ridiculous. I just don't want to be here. I feel like anyone who reads this is just going to write me off and minimize everything I'm saying. I don't know who I am anymore. All of the bullying. It's so hard to forget the things that my piers have said and done to me. It's so hard to get over all of my mistakes no matter how big or small. I beat myself up every ****ing day. When I look into a mirror, my reflection changes every time I ****ing blink. I see a monster. I feel like a monster. I don't want to be here anymore. I cleaned out my computer...threw away items that I don't want my family to find. I'm just scared. I want to slit my wrists in my bathtub. It seems so euphoric. Please help me. I'm not looking for attention or a post saying ""please don't do it."" I just want some kind of help I don't know what to do anymore."
586,Is this a good reason to commit suicide?,"Should someone such as myself who is 30 years old, is a loser virgin, and who has NEVER had a girlfriend consider committing suicide? Let's face it, NO WOMAN is going to want some loser such as myself who is a 30 year old virgin. With that being said, I would like to say that I HAVE NOT remained a virgin by choice, but have lived in military towns my entire life which don't have much ""selection"" in terms of available single women. I feel like a complete FREAK at this point in my life. After I got out of the military, I had a manufacturing job and was subsequently laid off. I then began my undergraduate education and am now only a couple of semesters away from graduating. I've tried everything guys. I've tried online dating in Colorado Springs and have also tried talking to women on my college campus and none of them want anything to do with me as they ALWAYS tell me about their boyfriend when I try to talk to them. Anyway, I'm not going to kill myself anytime in the immediate future, but it is something that I have nonetheless contemplated as I am a complete failure when it comes to women. One last thing, it REALLY bothers me that I didn't get to lose my virginity to another virgin while in high school like alot of guys get to do. If I do ever have sex with someone then it will certainly be to a non-virgin which makes me hate myself even more."
587,Not sure what's stoping me,"After learning that my wife has been lying to me since the day we said ""i do"" and has cheated numerous times, I have become rather depressed and angry. A cheating/lying wife is no reason to want to die by any stretch but I seem to have had a dark cloud over my life and situations like these seems to have taken a toll on me. I get to a point where I can do nothing but stare off into space wondering what I did wrong to deserve the bull**** I am forced to endure every day. It also doesn't help that the one person who I can talk to any time I need a ""friend"" is the person who broke my heart. Other people in my life couldn't care less about what I'm feeling or have to say (which is why I'm posting here... I've got no one else to turn to). In the passed two weeks, I've learned that my wife has been lying and cheating since before we got married, my art has been rejected from two different art galleries with no explanation why and I'm so stressed that my daughter's usually funny toddler antics have caused me to have break downs because my stress is so high and my patience is so short."
588,"Before you act, think of your family.",I recently attempted suicide. You may or may not have seen the post here which was intended to be my last.
589,Should I keep waiting?,"I told myself before I started graduate school that I would end my life once I graduated- if things didn't get better. Well, things haven't been better overall (a few improvements here and there, but then things get even worse), so I've decided to go with the orginal plan. I could try to work on life, but I don't want to. I have no evidence that it would improve for good, plus I don't think I want it to. I've wanted to kill myself for over 22 years, since I was 10. I don't value this life, and it's time to finally do something for me. So why am I even waiting until graduation?"
590,Does everyone think of killing themsleves when they hit rock bottom..,"I think I have hit rock bottom, ive caused everything around me to crumble...and more then 5 times out of my day I think of ways to kill myself. The worse thing is that I am too scared to even try any of the ideas I have come up with. I am tired of seeing myself die in my head half of the day. I'm just exhausted."
591,Could use some guidance please.,"I feel like I am at the last of my rope. I feel disconnected from everyone. I am turning 40 next year and I feel stuck in a dead end job in property management as my career. I have no relationships because I have a hard time accepting the fact I have walls up when it comes to being intimate. I go through my day from beginning to end miserable. I have no spirituality/religion. I joined NA over 90 days ago and I am healthier than ever, but with this clarity I have seen I have wasted my adult life and I am super insecure. I wanna just die. I used to hate people like myself and often thought if they were that miserable than just go do it. I really didn't want this to happen to me, I made bad choices and feel overwhelmed. HELP!"
592,just need to throw it out there,"hey, im new to this forum, just needed a place to express myself and my situation."
593,My Boyfriend Says He Can't Live Without Me,"Hey guys,"
594,The shame and regret are unbearable,"My depression is worse than it has ever been. I lie awake at night thinking about how my life is a ruin and a waste. The little hope I used to have is now completely gone. I am getting older, I am no better, all I have are regrets over the lost life and potential I once had."
595,Feeling at the end of the tunnel,"My life never seems to be complete without a man. However relationships never work out for me. I find people to date, I date them, they leave me, they ALL leave me. No matter how loyal, how much I love them, or just be myself, they leave. I have determined that no man will ever love me and stay with me. This thought makes me life sad, small, depressing, because the breath of my existence is in finding a companion."
596,I,an't do this. I'm sick of everything i hcant handle tis anymore i- I'm done
597,Just want to end it,I hate every aspect of myself and I hate every aspect of my life. I am filled with regret. I wasted my life. The things that used to make me happy no longer make me happy
598,i dumped my friend but had to feel guilty,"for an 8 month period my relationship with my best friend became intolerable, i guess in short to describe it he was a narcissist and very selfish while i was codependent on him - he is a very religoius jew and i am not and he made me feel guilty i wasnt always saying the proper prayer for my father who passed away 9 months ago - although that wasn't the emotional reason why i couldnt stand him anymore, it was the rational reason why i realized i couldnt remain friends - the discussion of religion, my late father, and my personal beliefs were way too personal and touchy for him to use as bullets against me and to make me feel guilty"
599,Just not happy,"So I recently moved to a completely new area, hundreds of miles away from where I spent the last 26 years of my life to start a job. And I'm not happy... at all. I 've down here for a month and my job is kinda crappy. They lied to me about how long my training would be (an extra year) and huge problems with my starting. Right now I don't really do anything and I have another 2 months before anything changes. I don't have friends here. I'm a shy person and don't just go out and make friends without someone or something to help me."
600,Same as before,"As the title says, just as before, I am still terribly stuck. I've moved on to the phase of losing interest in all I used to love. I-I'm exhausted. Really, truly tired. I know I have to keep pushing on, butI really don't want to. I know I should better myself and try exercising more and making myself do things, but honestly, I really don't want to! I just- I have no more energy to do it. I'm kind of just waiting for some freak accident or something to come by and help me on my merry way. And yes, I am aware I'm being a whiny annoying little ***** but I'm done! I'm just. ****ing. Done."
601,wish i could be anybody else but me,"realizing i really have no hope for my life, for years i've been telling myself it will get better, but im the same person no matter where i am. I literally will zone out for most of the day and pretend i'm someone else, someone successful and well liked, and its like i'm living out their life in my head....it helps me to escape the feeling of emptiness I have. but eventually the fantasy has to end and then I just hit rock bottom and can't stop crying because i have nothing in my life."
603,So sad....please help,"This is probably gonna be a long one, so bear with me. I honestly don't know how to begin.."
604,My life has been a complete waste,I haven't posted on this forum in a long time.

606,I am at the fork in the road- should I live or die?,Hi.
607,I am not meant to be alive,"I'm so sick of life, or in my case, a pitiful existence. Anytime that I feel hopeful, or things start going well, I find out that I am wrong. It's just too much too handle. I am a fool for continuing to try. I am simply beyond repair."
608,I would jump out of this window right now if I wast sure I wouldn't live.,"I'm a worthless twenty year old college student. My grades have steadily been on the decline. I spend most of my days at the library, where instead of working, I just wallow in my loneliness. I'm in college where people are out-and-about and social. I have no friends. I've never been to a party in my life. Last Sunday I spoke a total of six words to another human being. That's how little contact I have with other people. People don't like me because I'm revolting. I'm lanky, very skinny, and overall unattractive. I'm sure I come off creepy to many."
609,Losing hope,"I'm not any better. Actually work has gotten worse. Now I have things to do but I feel completely inadequate. The other new guy does stuff and works on independent projects while I sit at my desk after I complete my work doing nothing. I feel like no one in the lab likes me and thinks I just sit there all day. My friends, the only aspect of my life I ever felt kept me going don't talk to me anymore. I'm too far away to be included in things. My mother called me tonight and perked an attitude and hung up on me... leaving me to want to just text her ""don't worry I'll wait til your planned visit on the 20th for you to claim my body."" I just don't see happiness in my future. I feel so alone, like never before, that I have nothing. I can't take life much longer."
610,tonight I die,"tonight i die,no turning back no apologies.my life as I see it left me by the wayside in a clot of chocking dust. A failed business 2 failed marriages one just recent after 18 years, a house forclosed , and friends and family that have seemingly abandoned me. little is left but the pain and that is one thing I cannot keep anymore. the rope is stung the deed will be done and in the morning no one will shed a tear for another fool gone"

613,Please help,Please help
616,Dont know what to do... i have 3300mg of quetiapine here and am contimplating,So i have attempted to jump from a bridge but was forcefully stopped.. it has ben over a year and everything is still so messed up.. i have no one i can talk to and feel so alone... im so close to just popping all these pills. but still have a very faint voice saying hold on.. but its hard to carry on when no one loves you and you feel no matter what you do its never good enough.. someone please help me before its to late i dont know where else to turn without seeing the judgemental eyes and people who just dont understand
617,What do you do when you're already dead inside?,"Let me preface this by saying that I'm not to the point where I'm considering taking my own life, nor do I think I will ever be at that point. But more and more, I just feel like there's nothing in this life for me. I feel like my existence is completely pointless. I have no motivation to do anything, nor have I had any motivation for a very long time. Even the simple things I used to find it enjoyment in, like music, none of it really does anything for me anymore. I have no one in my life that I feel I can trust or relate to; my family has greatly let me down, and I absolutely suck at connecting with other people and creating and maintaining friendships."
618,So... now what?,"""People think I just want to be different, but to be honest... I just don't fit in."" I read something along the lines recently. It might even be right. Amongst that quote, i'll pass one another one.. (or two) probably."
619,Just something to get off my chest.,Well it's late and I'm on the computer just thinking about things...
620,I feel I'm a burden,"I'm not writing this for sympathy, or any advice!!!!!"
621,"Suicidal thoughts, major depression, need hope?",I’m not sure how to do this or even why imp doing it. I have been thinking about writing down how I feel but it is too complex. I wish I had a way to explain people what is going on but I don’t. Well here’s the story in a short format.
623,I feel so lost...,"I've ruined the greatest thing that ever happened to me. My wife left me two weeks ago after five years together. I had an emotional affair three years ago and lost my wife's trust. I don't even know if it was an emotional affair, I was talking to her because she showed me attention. My wife tried to get over it but she couldn't and so she left me. She said she was tired of living in fear and of not feeling good enough. I can't believe I betrayed her like that and ruined us. We built a life together, I wanted to have babies with her. She is so much better than me, I wonder where I went wrong. How things could have been different."
625,The sad thing is...,"And maybe Im just generalizing here, based on my own experiences but I feel like the individuals who really want suicide.. who have become so overwhlemed and out of hope... they usually don't post on here or don't call the help lines because they don't want to be made to feel guilty or maybe they're just so apathetic, they've lost the motivation to. I only mention it because MOST people who do call those lines or who post on here aren't 100% committed to doing it, which is a very good thing. The fact that they still reach out means that they want someone to back them off the ledge, even if they don't want to admit it. Even those people who sound ""excited"" about the prospect of ending their life have enough doubt that they need to post on a forum to have it validated or refuted by others..."
627,My (ex) boyfriend has suicidal thoughts and blames me,"Hi everyone,"
628,"This is it, don't think I can hold on","This is it, don't think I can hold on. Feels like it's not worth sticking around so many failed attempts but this time I don't want to fail"
629,"Stuck. Very, very stuck.","So I guess to start this all off, Suicide has been on my mind for a while now. Never ceasing, never disappearing from my thoughts for too long. I just- I want it over with. Even with medication, the stress from life, work, school, and friends overwhelm me. Daily panic attacks keep me from sleeping Why not just end it and solve all of my problems? Well I'm too aware of the effect it would have on my family and friends and- well... everyone. I can't do that to them, nor can I keep living like this. I've been stuck between killing myself and moving on and dealing with it for my family for four years now. I kind of wish some accident would come along and make the decision for me."
630,I think I did it again...,"Hello all,"
631,cant think of an appropriate title,First off i should make it clear that i am NOT going to end it..
632,"I need help, someone to talk to, to overcome this feeling..",I don't usually post on forums like this because I'm the type of girl who keeps things bottled up and is strong for other people but now it's all got too much and I can't carry on this way
633,...over it.,i'm done.
634,Please help- need it to work,"Please help. I need to kill myself, don't try and talk me out of it. Problem is its so hard. I've researched and can't find anything that would work 100% on the first try. It has to work."
636,I just don't know what to do anymore...,"My back story with my ex and I is long and complicated but things have been looking a little better. On a side not, for this story to make sense, I am a Soldier in Afghanistan. So technically relationships are greatly frowned down upon but NOT illegal. You are just not allowed in the room of someone of the opposite sex. Which makes life in Afghanistan for a girl extraordinarily difficult. I met my boyfriend in Afghanstian but he was a contractor, not a Soldier. We clicked. He is one of the most amazing people I have ever met and just hanging out with him and being around him makes me happy. My team is horrible and they are rude and mean and being around him helps me find some sense of normalcy."
637,Parasuicide,"I feel closer to actually following through with suicide this time more than ever,"
638,how to kill myself painless,"well im 21 years old and i find out that, the girl that i loved and still love..is going out with another boy, and i cant take it anymore i just dont want to live no more so if some1 can healp me and tell me which is the best way to kill myself"
640,Thinking of calling a suicide hotline but can't find it in me to,"For a while I've felt suicidal but I've read helpful books, tv shows and movies that helped to dissipate those feelings. At one point I felt like I wasn't suicidal anymore and I found a new appreciation for life but it came back again. I started reading all the books in the library on suicide, going over every bit of advice that could help me. I felt like the advice was helpful and I started to feel a bit stronger but I still have thoughts of suicide. I don't have money for therapy, which is something else I've considered. It's something I think I really need actually. So I was sitting here looking at the phone trying to dial the suicide hotline so maybe they could help. I kept dialing the number over and over but not sending it. I started getting frustrated with myself because I couldn't bring myself to do it. I know I need help but one of the problems I have is with anxiety and I started thinking too much. I tried to look up people who have used a suicide hotline but I couldn't really find a lot. I wonder how you find it in you to do it."
641,My last day.,"Wake up, lunch with the only person I believe is a real human being, kiss her for the last time, buy a pack of cigarettes, an eight pack of beer and a bottle of extra strength painkillers. Get home, watch my favorite movie, call my mom, talk casualy and tell her I love her. Have my dad over for coffee, tell him I love him. Listen to my favorite songs, cry for what could be the last time. Now, I post on here."
642,Questions for moderators only,"What is the procedure if someone is suiciding online? eg popping pills, overdosing or other."
643,finally had enough,"I had posted on this forum two years ago after a really hurtful breakup followed by a lot of medical problems. Maybe someone will look those up. Welll life has gotten so much worse. I have continously opened my heart to people only to be abandoned and have them use me and throw me away like so much garbage. I need to take lovenox for a blood clotting disorder cause by a lack of will to live, trust me on that, i have takin five times my precribed dosage, im hoping it will cause another brain bleed and illl die. Everyonei try to be kind and supportive to treats me like crap. I do love myself but everyone has their limits. I hope i dont wake up. I hate the world thats been my life"
644,ugh,just so tired of it all.... things rarely go my way and tired of being hurt. that bullet next to me always looks so tempting and easy.
646,Life is not worth living with a 5 inch penis.,I am a 22 year old virgin who has never kissed a girl. My penis is a pathetic 4.75-5 inch length and 4 inch girth. It seems so pathetic to me to be a grown 22 year old man and have the penis of a 14 year old boy. I do not see the point in living life anymore with such a cursed handicap. I hate myself more then words can express for being so inadequate sexually.
647,Im thinking bout suicide,Hello to everyone ... I'm 31 years old and I broke up with my gf since December until now I always tought she gonna be back with me but in the last month I understood she never will be back with me.. I'm really sad about it .. And I don't know what to do it my life is a complete failure And I start thinking about suicide ... I'm really depressed about it!! I think the best way to end my problem is kill my self ... I'm in foreign country and I don't have real friends where I can talk about it.. More the days are passing more I think what is the best way to take my life !! Since I understood she will never be back with me I started thinking about what I did wrong and I recognize I been a complete as...le with her.. She loved me soo much .. But when u have everything u never really appreciate the simple things... Now I'm in this situation in my life where I don't wanna fight with anybody and I'm sick of everybody.. I have a job with big responsibility and I worked hard to get at this point but I'm not happy!! my life is a complete failure without her and more I see her happy with other people more I'm getting piss off about it.. I really care about it but I can't see my life with out her!!
648,A painless way to commit suicide,First of all I want to make something clear. Do not try to stop me from commiting suicide. I'm not posting messages on this forum to hear that people will be sad because I'm dead. I have a mental disease and I just can't be helped.
649,Could be saying goodbye over the next two weeks...,"Suicide is not new to me. I've had these feelings for so long I don't even notice the fantasies anymore. It's like anything else now that passes through my head. The first time I thought about suicide I remember it was a big deal. I couldn't believe I had just had a suicidal thought. Now it's just part of my day to day. My parents are going out of town for the next two weeks. I'm glad they'll be gone. I love them, but I hate being 26 and still living in their home. I'll like being alone for two weeks but I also wonder if I may finally act on these suicidal thoughts given this elongated alone time. The main thing that has always stopped me is not wanting them to find my body."
650,I'll be better off dead,Im living in a hallway of my moms ex boyfriends house I have nowhere to go I cant get a job Everyone want me out should I kill myself
651,I give up.,I really do.
652,I'm Tired,"I am in so much pain I don't know where to start. I am 37 years old and in that time, have lost both my parents, been screwed out of several jobs, am broke, have no ""true"" friends and for 10 years, had to shoulder the constant, continual, life changing burden of caring for an aging grandmother (who passed away this March)."
654,why should i live at all,i have been posting in enotalone forum for quite some time for i dont know what reason...
655,just tired of my self..,"ever since i was little i was a happy kid. but in reality i hated myself. now that I'm 18 i cant take it anymore I'm so lonely i have amazing friends and family but how can it be that i feel so worthless and lonely when I'm in a room full of people that i love and love me. some times i wish i an opportunity would arise where i can sacrifice my life in order for someone else to live. and hopefully wish that i mattered to them even if it was for that brief moment. i have thought about going to the military and just dieting recklessly. but i * * * in hate all those recruiters who honestly don't give a * * * * about who they are recruiting...why do i hate myself i honestly don't know. i used to weigh 215 pounds then decided to lose weight and i lost 58 pounds. and i still feel so lonely and worthless. i don't get it. am i missing a girlfriend, some times i feel like i can't even connect with someone. i feel just so dead inside. i do anything for that level of connection. i masturbate more than usual. i even looked for a hooker and paid 40 bucks. i regret it so much. how could i have sunk that low. at times i just wanna write a note to my family and friends and just saying I'm sorry i could never face u guys again. i still haven't made an attempt to kill myself, but have i come close. i was walking in the train station a little to close to the tracks and didn't even realize the train was coming and it missed by literally maybe an inch or two...i didn't even react didn't even care just told myself wow i almost died..didnt even care..can someone please talk to me Im losing all hope at this point......"
656,Some Times People Don't UnderStand,"I can't seem to do anything with out making some one disappointed or mad at me. No one understands what i'm going through at my house. My parents can't EVER seem to tell when something is wrong they don't give me any chances to prove to them that i am trustworthy. And this makes me so upset. I'll come home pissed and they won't ask me whats wrong or anything. I feel ALONE in this world i keep thinking that if i just kill my self now i might come back with a different life a new family, and some who cares. I'm the kid in school who every one pushes around , and i've learned that if i push back that i get in more trouble then they do and it makes me feel weak. Some times i wish life would end for me so i dont have to disappoint any one else. Even my brother tried to kill himself because he hates me and every one in our family. I've even made my self a whole new person and my parents haven't noticed. I used to listen to country music and soft kind of things, now im in to Blood On The Dance Floor ,and a bunch of new bands. I don't know what to do........"
657,I'm scared and need advise,"I have never posted anything like this before so please excuse me if I am unclear. I am 27 and have suffered bouts of depression since I was 12, some mild some more severe, one 2 years ago when I attempted suicide...the usual cry for help kind of attempt but I did felt out of control and completely removed from myself and the world around me.In recent months I have been getting the same feeling I had two years ago- Nervous talking to people (colleagues and friends) anxious at the thought of talking to someone or socialising, I get overwhelmed by tasks as small as making dinner, I make plans and cancel at the last minute, I am becoming more and more emotionally dependant on my partner which leaves me feeling worse when I think about how I can't seem to get through the day with out seeking reassurance from him. When I am not feeling low I am smart and fun to be around but I feel that is slipping away more and more. The people that knew me as fun to be around now know that I have this other side and that leaves me so insecure even when I am in good form and chatting away to someone I think to myself 'well they are know I'm a depressed waste of a person so what's the point in pursuing happiness'. As write this I realise how silly that is but it is what goes through my mind. I work in the 'art world', I studied a degree in art practice but I still feel so inadequate around other artists and curators, I want to be as knowledgeable as them and I get focused and start reading the texts (mostly philosophy) but I think I'm reading for the wrong reasons, it is like I am trying to become better by knowing more which is fair enough I guess but in the process of reading I panic that I have so far to go in order to be good at what I do so I stop and draw the same conclusion each time 'I am not smart enough,I should just give up now because it is making me feel like s**t'. I look around me and the people that seem happy are the ones that don't ask so many questions and accept what they are capable of and work within those limits.I analyse everything, each conversation I walk away from I play it back in my head and pick out the parts that I sounded stupid. I judge other people too, if they say one tiny thing that could sound ignorant, racist, prejudice or backward I label them as the thing they said. I then feel guilty and recognise how unfair that is and conclude that not only am I an idiot, I am unkind too. This goes on and on every day, I am feel so sad because I know under it all that I am kind and smart but I just can't seem to get past all these negative thoughts. I feel exhausted and just want to quit my job, break up with my boyfriend, cut ties with my family and kill myself. I am scared that I could actually do these things unless I get help."
658,Can't do it any more,Stress out
659,My little bro is suicidal and I don't know how to approach this.... :(,"I heard today through my little sis that my bro was saying he felt ""suicidal"". Just feel really sick to the stomach, worried, upset that he feels this way. I know how it feels and it's the worst feeling, the depths of darkness it's so frightful."
661,Please Help !,"I am at the end. i feel as though i have no where else to turn , how can i get over the issues i have with my self. I wish i never felt as though people always judge me for my personality or what i look like, how can i stop feeling like this. Please Help"
663,I don't know what to do.,"Well... My life is a mess since the day I've started to know what it is. My parents aren't married. My father says everyday that I'm a piece of you know what, and a useless. My mother hates my father. Since I was 10 she says that she can't stand his face anymore and want to leave here, but they had a conversation and decided that both of them would stay for a while because of me. He's not a bad person. He works hard, never did drugs or drink and stuff like that. Neither she. They're both ""good people"" speaking about education. Not academic education, but home education."
664,Needing some help at home.,"Okay, well. To start off I should probably say that as it stands right now, I am not entirely suicidal."
665,my friend is threatening to kill himself if i don't give him a chance.,"so there is this guy who i have known for like 6 years. we have been freinds. but he has been in love with me for 3 years. i didn't like him that way and never would date him. he always gets upset when i date other guys and never give him a chance. he says he is in love with me and that he don't want to be without me anymore and that i always give everyone a chance but him, blah blah.. and now he is saying he is going to kill himself. and that he means it this time and he is tired of living and all. he has issues. he hasn't been able to get a job etc etc and i won't date him. i actually have a boyfriend now for the last 2 months. he has been calling me a lot and leaving voice mails on my phone and saying that i should have been with him all along and that he is going to kill himself and if i don't talk to him and that it's going to be all my fault becaause i won't give him a chance. and said it will be on my conscious forever that a guy killed himself over me. what do i do??? will it really be my fault??"
666,I just want to lay down and die.,"I am 59 years of age and I have four confirmed bad marriages. It looks like I am headed for my fith. I never beat my children, abused them or put them down. I created one boy and raised two other children as though they were mine. As of now, has been this way for some time, my children want nothing to do with me."
667,Thinking about ending it,"Let me start with this - I don't think I could actually bring myself to end my life. I think about it all the time though. It haunts me. And for all I know I am capable of it, but I hope that I'm not."
668,by the end of this year....,"If I can't achieve my goals of having a job that allows me to support myself and/or have a girlfriend that loves, cares about me then I am going to off myself I am sick and tired of pain disappointment and emarassment any longer, I will no longer have to my two crappy and degrading jobs I won't feel lonely any more, no more financial, no more involuntary, no more dealing with my. Autism no more living with my at nearly 30 , no more pain or hurt ever again"
669,Tell us your reasons to stay.,So many threads here list reasons to end it.
670,I don't know.,"Lets start from the beginning...Which was when i moved to Ballin Public School in year 2. Year 2 through to year 6, was horrible. No friends. Got into fights because they initiated it. Got picked on by almost everyone even my year 5 teacher, by god did i wanna smash her head in. Worst. Teacher. Possible. Now i know its your everyday typical scenario but what i gained over those years, isn't very nice."
671,How do I stop,How do I talk myself out of hurting myself? My heart ache is more than I can take
672,"Yea, I think were done here.","Oh, what a beautiful day in the neighborhood!"
673,i cant commit suicide all i can do is sleep,"my father was diagnosed with brain cancer in december of 2008 ever since then ive been in and out of depression and now its taken a turn for the worse, my dad died 8 months ago in sept of 2011 and i have recurring dreams of him, my best friend who i relied on became such an * * * * * * * and has said hurtful things that i have dreams of hurting him, i cant believe im still friends with him he was suppose to be there to support me but he just used my guilty feelings of grief against me and took advantage of me to do him favors, ive never hated someone before but i hate my friend for putting me down while i was in the dirt,"
675,Would like some peace!,"I don't know if this is the correct place to post my self indulgent whinge, apologies if it isn't."

679,My story of my only suicide attempt,This has been very hard for me to talk about but I feel like I have to.
680,i'm feeling like dying???? pls help,iwanna die? wanna know method which kills me without hurting my organs which i feel like donating?
681,Ready for Death..,"Hi, If you read my posts i have a history of suicidal tendencies and attempts. I want to die, im in a place where i have nothing now. Im thinking about trying to rob someone who has a gun, if they awaken and shoot me, so be it. I recently spent time in the hospital because i tried to rob someone and they stabbed me. I was in the hospital for 3 days, had surgery and have recovered for the most part, only i suffered a fractured shoulder when it happened as well and that is still healing. Messed up huh?"
682,Well that went about as well as I should have expected...,"So a few days ago, I met this girl on a site similar to this. I was feeling down and asked for help. A few people responded to the thread, one of them was this girl. She suffered the same type of depression, sucidal and everything. She pulled me out of my funk, and for a while it seemed like a miracle just fell into my lap. She was so sweet to me too, She made me feel like a million dollars, dispite the fact that i'm a complete waste of human life."
684,why,i have the right to not want to be here anymore it doesnt mean i dont believe in God or that i need God to help me it just means im done its just not working for me anymore and since i cant take my own life i just want to be in the path of a stray bullet ... maybe this suicide by cop is worth a try in henderson they shoot first maybe thats why im here
685,The worst I've ever felt,"A lot of stuff has happened to me in the last couple of months and I've been struggling to keep a positive outlook on it all, it's got to the point where I just want everything to stop. I've never been the type of person who'd consider committing suicide or anything like that, but lately I've been feeling so low that I don't know what I'll do. At the same time I feel like I've brought it all on myself."
686,help,"this is my first post on this site so far, but to the matter at hand. im currently in college and going for a degree that i have only been in for 2 semesters now. i have always had to put up with a lot of stress and when i expressed that i didnt want to continue in the degree i was going for to my mom, she through a fit. i want to go for something that would make me happy but she mocks it and acts like want i want to pursue is nothing. ive been dealing with depression for a while now and had it just all bubbled up inside me, and with everything thats been going on with me and my family im at the point where im just done. i am having a hard time with the stress from my college, home, and just everyday life. i just am at the point where im ready to end it all."
687,To those that want to kill themselves,"Hi, thanks for reading this. I read a few postings in this topic and many of you have lost faith in your life. I understand how you feel because that's how I feel. I'll make this as brief as possible and then you can decide if ending your own life is still worth it."
688,Help...,"I really don't know what to do...everywhere I turn im a failure, my family tells me how useless i am the only one really there for me is my bf but i feel like even he isnt enough to help me..i am 18 years old and i feel like i cant take anymore, i was ran out of my school by bullies and teachers or police wouldnt help my family tells me i deserve it and i just cant take it, my mother is the worst about it telling me ill never go anywhere or do anything, im at the end someone please help."
689,Just curious,Whats the easiest way to do it ??
691,trapped and hopeless,"Normally I'm the strong one. Saving other people from themselves and putting on a brave face in bad times. I've always believed that suicide is not an option. Yet, I've struggled with self harm and suicidal thoughts for almost 6 years now. It used to be okay, because when it got bad I could check myself in to the hospital and get the help I needed. Now I can't do that. No insurance, no job. My means of financial support are my aging parents who can barely make ends meet with their retirement checks and social security income. I can't seek help on their dime."
692,Help me end my life!!,"Hi All,"
693,I want to die.,"I'm not really expecting people to rush to my aid or take me too seriously, but I thought that posting this would relieve a bit of mindclutter. Sorry if I don't explain things well, I don't usually express these things. Thank you for reading in advanced."
694,Goodbye Everyone,"I haven't been on here alot and its been about a month since I last posted, but I just wanted to say goodbye and thanks to the people on here for their help and words of encouragement. The truth is I'm just to far gone and my life has been messed up beyond repair to keep going. I plan on ending my life in the next couple months probably by taking some sleeping pills and driving my car off the road somewhere in the hopes of making it look like an accident. If everything goes well I wont wake up again. So again, I just wanted to say thanks and I hope you all have the courage and strength that I didnt have to get better and live the life you deserve. Goodbye"
695,Forum post of little significance,"It never ceases to amaze me how much guilt I feel from writing these. First I post it, then I have to think and anylize it. I wonder about things like, ""Did I say this right?"" or ""Was that clear enough"" and the obligatory ""What if I accidently write something that offends someone, and it completely ruins their day, even when they were nice enough to read it-"" UGH. This is insane! Even when I have help at my disposal, I can never seem to properly allocate it. I've seen a therapist for several years now. And I can never get myself to talk about things that still make me sad as hell, To a suicidal level. But the logic behind it is amazing, I don't want to make"
696,Thought about dying today...,Had another bad time where i feel like dying.
697,"Can suicide ever be seen as a justifiable, rational and acceptable choice?","Throughout my teenage years and up until now I've always contemplated suicide, it used to be a emotional draining and scary train of thought but over the years, the factor of pain, misery and sadness gradually started to fade away. From what I've noticed, it's extremely difficult to discuss the subject of suicide with people as their views are generally set in stone. They are usually always heavily optimistic, pro life and against suicide for reasons which seem to be emotionally fueled with occasionally a touch of fear."
698,Help for Depression,"Hello everyone,"
701,some advice needed,"My little boy is 10months old and his father, who was not involved through his own choice, has recently committed suicide. His family have also declined to be involved and it transpires that he told them all that my baby wasn't his and they believe this. His death takes the truth with it and I think they will always want to believe what he told them."
702,painless quick death?,i have got to a point in my life where I cant go on anymore and i was just wondering if anyone knew any quick and pain free ways to kill yourself? Dont give me any crap about people will miss you they wont ive been crying out for someone to care for weeks and my own mum wont even pick up the phone to me my friends do anything they can to avoid me i fail at everything my time is up please just tell me how i can kill myself quick and pain free i need to do it today
703,Fighting a battle that I cant win,"I don't know how much longer I can endure fighting this constant everyday battle with myself and the world around me. I'm almost 22 and have been suffering with crippling depression and anxiety, brought on by many reasons outside of my control, for as long as I can remember and its not going away with time. I've held on for years now believing the notion that things would get better with time and taken many avenues to try and get better but its all lead me to dead ends and right back to where I started. If anything its gotten worse and I'm drained from it, both physically and mentally. Two years ago, I had set a date and had a plan to take my life, but decided to seek help. This time around I don't think I'll have the strength to do so. It really is only a matter of time...."
704,Goodbye.,"You know, I""m so over people not believing * * * * i say. I've had this happen all my damn life! And now i get it on here too. Man, You people have no freaking idea about the situation i face, so why bother tryna friggin help me when you got no idea on the situation?!?!?!?! I'm sorry if this is harsh in any way, but dude, if you got something that's hate or something towards that, then don't bother bloody commenting on my posts. All i need is advice not people telling me it's not real. Oh and just so you know, i recieved an email from her today with a pic of her, so i know in-fact it's real. I've even had her friends bloody explain it to me! God, I'm so frustrated!"
705,Suddenly it doesn't seem such a bad idea,"I used to think suicide was a selfish and cowardly way out of a difficult situation. Now I feel guilty for all the times I said that when I feel like it's an option in my life now. I haven't researched it, nor do I want to do it, but I am so exhausted with fighting myself against giving up and always trying to pretend i'm happy and fine, I'm not fine at all."
707,unsure getting help is helping,"I have just started getting treated for depression. Talking to a shrink in the first time in years has made me realize just how pathetically debilitated my depression and anxiety I have been. I have done a lot of interesting things in my life, traveled, always been adventurous to find out about the way other live locally and abroad and was even a bit of an activist for awhile. My jumping around to get my broad view of life has left me with a lot of experience and no actual accomplishments. I am 28 so this is starting to seem like a mistake. Worst of all, I never really enjoyed any of it like I should have, I have always been depressed. For some reason telling a doc about my panic attacks, my evening spent curled in a fetal position, my fears just made me realize how messed up I am and has really hit me hard. I think about dieing because it relaxes me. I think there is an escape. I have just stared on meds and I fear that they will make my reassuring fantasy of killing myself seem more possible. I don't know if it the effect of the pills or just the shock of realizing how sick I am. Over the last year I have pushed everyone away. I have always been anti social and keep people at arms length. I don't have any close friends but I can go to the bar on a good day, chat ever one up, be charming as hell, even make plans to met up later with some of my 'new friends' and when the time comes I get gripped again with anxiety and I don't show. I am sure I come off like an ass, if I run in to one of me one night stand friendships, I feel awkward and just want to get out of the situation as quickly as possible. I have a husband but the marriage is very strained. He is extremely depressed and will not seek help. He refuses to go out with me and so he is starting to forget about the fun parts of me and only sees the upset, anxious and afraid to leave the house parts of me. I am sure that is not helping things. I just can't help shaking the feeling of being ill, tainted by mental illness, and ashamed I can't seem to help my husband. I often have hope, but sometimes I sink so deep in hopelessness I am afraid I will do something rash."
708,Suicide is Selfish,"Nothing grates my ears and sickens my stomach more than these three words lumped together. Especially on the internet when a person is in their darkest hour. Whatever the benevolent intentions, do people realize how rude and ignorant saying this is?"

710,Is there...?,Is there any actual proper way to kill yourself? Cause i wanna know.
711,hi,Life is in shambles... I try to lean on my best friend and she puts me off for social networking. I could really use some new friends.
712,Can you overdose on Xanax?,"I got a text at midnight from my best friend. It said ""I took 7 Xanax. Will I die? CJ (her fiancé) makes me feel like ****."""
713,slitting my carotid artery,I shouldn't because his family will be the ones to find me.

721,Having dark thoughts,"I know this is bad and i'm honestly not looking for attention (or, am i? i doubt everything i do lately). But, today, i've been having toughts about slitting my wrists and just watching the blood run out. It's really weird, it's a hot day and i know my blood would drain quite quickly. Whilst sometimes i don't want to face reality, i'm not sure that i want to die. But, then there's times that i really don't care and can almost imagine myself doing it somehow, for this world is full of brutes, unworthies and arseholes."
722,How do I keep my hope up,Hi All
723,I need someone to talk to...I am so lonely here...,"please can someone talk to me and help me sort out my life a bit. its all so twisted, i am going crazy."
724,I blame myself for my kid's stature.,"I blame myself for my kid's stature. She is so small only 4'7 or 4'6. When she was a baby, she always complained to have stuffy nose. I thought her to breath thru her mouth and it became habitual. Only to find out that it has side effect and her bone has fused early. My heart hurts everytime I see her. I want to go away but I have other children that I should also take care off. I am already psyching her that it is okay, that i know a lot of people with a height like her... but I am not okay. I feel I am a bad mother. I am a bad mother! Only if I can bring back time.... I told her to stop breathing thru her mouth.... because mouthbreather is bad for her health. Oh God! I hope everything would turn out fine when she goes to college and have a life of her own. That's also the reason why I want to stay on and be at her side when things go wrong. I fear so much of her future. I want to forget everything but how??????"
726,It's Hard,"Life hasn't exactly been fun for me so far. I had a very bad childhood full of emotional and physical abuse and one day when I was 13 a girl came to school with a bandage around her wrist. Rumors flew around class that she had tried to kill herself over the weekend and my first thought was fear. She came into the room and I saw the white bandage and could smell the distinct scent of ointment and something in my head just kicked in...I wondered what it would be like to slit my wrists...to die...to go to Heaven. From that moment on I flirted more and more with the idea of killing myself and, at the same time, I began to feel depressed. In no time my thoughts were consumed with suicide. For 10 years straight, every waking moment all I could think about was how much I wanted to die. Being socially awkward, I didn't have any friends, I never dated and, having social anxiety disorder, I was terrified to leave the house. I was quite literally trapped with my depression."
727,It's happening again.. full blast...,"I'm fighting it, and tomorrow I will be fine, but I know someday I will give in."
728,I can't cope anymore,"I live my now pathetic life,"
729,What to do when you can't force someone to live anymore?,"After over a year of constant battling, forcing someone to stay alive... What do you do when you no longer have the ability to?"
730,How do I help my suicidal boyfriend?,"We have been together 5 years. In the last 2 we have had extreme stressors in our life and I see now that we both became depressed, we did not recognize it though. My depression had the effect on him of making him feel worthless. His depression had the effect on me that I had to take care of everything- work, bills, chores. He has expressed suicidal thoughts over the past year and each time the plans got more detailed. 2 weeks ago after a disagreeable day he left out an empty bottle of valium and an empty small bottle of vodka. I freaked that he had OD'd and slapped him awake... then didn't stop hitting him. All my rage came out that he would actually do that and I kept punching him after he opened his eyes. He was not himself and we scuffled then he followed me out of the room with a gun in his mouth. I ran screaming from our home and called the police. I thought we would get an ambulance and he would get some treatment. Instead he was arrested on domestic violence charges, spent the weekend in jail and now there is a state mandated restraining order. None of which is helpful to our situation. Our biggest stressor was financial and now we have 12K in court costs coming our way. And he can't come home to me and our kids."
731,I need help,"I am a 20 year old girl and all my life I've faced an incredibly low self esteem. I have to work twice as hard to get something I want but I end up falling on the same line or even behind people who haven't worked as much as I did. I've nourished big dreams and worked and honed my brains for them but didn't succeed. My father and teachers told me that I am an intelligent person, but I don't believe them, because why would I never get what I worked for? Now I'm into my final year of engineering and as much as I wanted to come first in my class, I'm almost the 20th in a class of 60. I used to think I have got good concepts but I recently attended a recruitment program in which I didn't even make it to the interview, had to leave after the written test. Even now if I'm doing problems my mind just clams up and I'm taking endless time to learn things that I would've learnt quicker 2 years ago. Besides, at times I get jitters and suddenly break into shivers every 5 minutes, my whole body trembling. I don't feel cold, I just see visions of me failing and being kicked around like a soccer ball by all my friends who've done better."
733,I don't think I wanna keep going,"I am having a really difficult time right now, I have never reached out like this before but I need to tell somebody about this. I want to die. There is no reason for me to stay. I have nobody. I stay shut up in my room for the entire day and nobody ever wants to do anything with me and for good reason. I am boring as hell and have no good qualities. My personal opinion is at an all time low and the worst thing is that it takes nothing for me to feel this way. It is just the way it is. It's a matter of desire. I have no desire to stay in a place where I am so alone. I just really need a hand right now."
734,My friend may have (i think he has) ended his life,"I got a text at 8:37pm (about 9 hours ago?) I was asleep, trying to sleep of my ear infection."
735,Has anyone turned their life around after suicide attempt?,Has anyone been so depressed that they tried to take their life then recovered back to a happy disposition?
736,I just need someone to talk to..,I suffer from a major case of social anxiety.
737,I want to commit suicide,I am 19 years old. I have been thinking about suicide for a few years now with my first attempt when I was 12 years old. I have attempted suicide 4 times but almost all of these were a massive cry for help which I am most certainly not going to deny. I was abused in every way possible by my father from when I can remember until I was 11 years old and I have only just recently reported the incidents to the police and awaiting a trial etc. as I know I wasnt the only one he abused. I don't know if this is the reason why I am serioudly contemplating it now.
738,suicide thoughts,"Hi, i am not looking for sympathy i don't really know what i'm looking for. i have self harmed in the past and have been clean for about a year.. but right now i just don't want to be here anymore i'm 20, with no friends.. no job, no money i don't see the point in life anymore. i'm so lonely and can't shake this feeling of just ending it all. i always end up giving up college because i have aspergers and the pressure is too hard for me. i just want to feel happy and when i see therapists it only works for a few weeks"
739,Caught myself thinking about that...,"It seems like the pain in my life won't even try to cease - after being unemployed for two years I finally found a job I like, in a town far away from where I come. BUT - I'm not getting paid cuz' small businesses usually have that kind of trouble and I might wait a week or two, or luckily just a few days until I get my salary."
740,I am seriously considering this,"Wow what a depressing forum, but I understand."
741,My father tried to commit suicide this morning.,"My 72 year old father has been suffering from severe OCD, depression, anxiety attacks etc for years now and the past month everything has come crashing down all at once - he also was recently diagnosed with diabetes and a severe hernia that will need surgery in the next few weeks. In the past 4 months he had lost 80 lbs as well."
742,how do i,hi there
743,"No more, I've decided",My father mentally and verbally abused me my whole life but every time I try to talk about it with anyone in my family they always say that he was right to do what he did. He never hit me or sexually abused me so I guess anything else is exceptable. Every day my mom tells me that there's another thing we have in common (both good and bad) or that I'm just like him. I've done everything I can to not be like him but every year my mom says it more and more and she knows me more than anybody. I don't want to pass these traits on to any kids I might have but even if I don't have any kids I'll still be just like him. I've finally come to terms with the fact that I can't keep myself from becoming like him so it would be better if I just died. I have nothing in my life that I enjoy anymore. Before i was only staying alive for my friends and family but it is completely unfair for them to want me to stay alive only for their own pleasure. Every day is too painful and I'm ready to say goodbye. I'm tired of living
744,Dont wanna feel the pain anymore...,"So much has happened in past 6 months. lost my dog, who was my best friend."
745,I feel helpless to stop him!,It's not me who's the suicidal one. It's someone whose page I stumbled upon on another site (DeviantArt).
747,Advice on leaving loved ones,"Hey everyone, I am new here:"
748,whats the best way to kill yourself without pain,Im tired of my life.im tired.i cannot hang into this.i just wanna be gone...disappear in the woods and not coming back forever.i know it is selfish..i know.im tired.im hopeless and i got no one.IM all alone.i want to end this today.setting up everything so that the one whose left will not going to have problems with me leaving forever.
750,"I don't want to live, but I won't kill myself...",25 years old
751,I think that's it,I don't know why I'm posting on here. I feel like I'm an attention * * * * * or maybe my subconscious is panicking and this is the only way to cope with it...
752,i am thinking to overdose on my meds today,"I want to sleep and have things be over. If i live, it will just keep hurting. I'm tired of struggling with the hope that someday things won't hurt as much. i like the thought of sleeping and being done."
753,What if the problem is actually permanent?,"So I'm basically a joke to everyone I know. I'm basically a failure and a fool. My whole life I've been spacey and always had trouble with the simplest things like following instructions, conversations and I get confused really easily. I freaking hate it and I don't can't fix it. I've been the idiot and fool my whole life. It's not in my head either (which past therapists tried to fool me into thinking)."
754,Into thin air,"Sometimes I feel like this world is better off without me in it. I don't want to be here, only upsetting people. I don't think I can bring myself to actually kill myself, but I think about how much better it would be if I could just disappear. Just me and my dogs. No one to upset. No one to tell me I'm ""too much to put up with"". No one to anger."
755,It has begun... finally!,I'm pleased to inform you all that I have finally mustered the courage to begin the process of ending my life. I should have done this four years ago but...better late than never!
756,"i don't know, i think i'm done","i think i'm done. i can't take life anymore and i'm sorry to say that but it's how i feel. not sure why i'm typing this, no point really."
757,Trying to find the point in life...,"Struggling to find the point in anything these days. I'm crazy busy, have a great family and good life but I'm just so down & empty these days. I've lost two of my best friends lately (not died just not friends anymore). I sometimes wonder if it would affect anyone if I was dead. Life would just go on & it wouldn't impact anyone really. How do I get out of this....funk?? 2011 has been hard bc of my husbands illness & financial struggles but I should be handling it better. On the outside everyone thinks I'm great. I feel like everyone is taking from me & not giving. Like everyone is so self absorbed. Help! Rational words please!"
758,"Dissatisfied with myself, and the world around me.","First off- I'm somewhat ashamed that I'm even considering a permanent resolution to temporary problems. Furthermore, that I had the gull to actually reach out for help. Life is hard for everybody, why am I complaining?"
759,Suicide. The Wolf and the Caribou.,"When I was younger, I remember watching a nature show which showed a baby caribou being chased by an adult wolf through the Canadian tundra. Although the Caribou was young, it could sprint with lightning pace and was capable of outrunning the wolf. However, it didn't have much stamina - something the wolf was blessed with. Although the caribou left the wolf in its wake in the first 1,000 yards, the caribou couldn't sustain the speed and the wolf's superior stamina prevailed. Needless to say, the wolf eventually caught up with the caribou and the animal's short life came to an end. I don't know why, but that moment is just one of those memories I've never quite been able to forget."
760,I saved a life - now what?,"My step-father (of whom I've been close with for almost 10 years) attempted suicide twice in the past month. Once was in mid-October and the other was in early November. The first time, his method of choice failed (I don't want to write it on here to give others idea) and he called my mother intoxicated and crying explaining what he had just attempted to do. After he calmed down, she went and got him. A week later (after numerous ""I'm fine now""s, extreme regret and sympathy), my mom found out that he was planning on doing it again (wouldn't respond to phone calls). She rushed home and he wasn't there. She couldn't find him so she called me."
761,Is it normal to feel more relieved now that I have the means?,"I started thinking about suicide again lately, so I went and bought sleeping pils and also got my hands on a lot of heart pils. I am thinking that sleeping pills would make me sleep before the heart pills would give me a stroke."
762,What's Your Reason For Living?,What keeps you going on those days when everything just goes completely wrong?
763,I'm cold,"Well, not really sure how to start. Pretty much want to die just like the rest of you. I have a lot of money, wonderful family and friends, and people know who I am. So why do I want to die? Nothing traumatic has happened to me to cause this surge of depressed thoughts to overflow into my head. They just seem to be there. I still laugh, work out, go to parties and such but I need to force myself. I've developed this bizarre feeling whenever someone asks to do something with me. All I really want to do is sit there and be that blob of flesh, bone, and guts. Yup. That's me, but I guess all people are just like that. Why the hell would someone want to post a tyrannosaurus icon, or have the need to for that matter? Why can't a die already? Today I actually found excitement in looking down the barrel of a handgun. I wish I had a good enough friend that would pull the trigger for me, but they're all too concerned with their own mental happiness and forget to think of mine. Honestly this is the only thing I'm selfish about. If I could take the place of a terminally ill person I would in a heart beat. Well damn, I'm terminally sick in the head so I guess I'll just wait my own turn. I'm done now, I need to return to sitting and breathing. Hopefully the latter of the sentence wont be true for long."
764,Change....,I have took an overdose in the past. Today I feel so down and depressed.
765,The End,"*I'm crying as I type this, so please excuse any errors*"
766,Today might be the day..,Today is not a good day even tho it's my sis birthday I can't be happy ? I want to be happy cuz it's her birthday so I am just fake being happy for her. tonight is the night I think I am going to end my life not cuz its her birthday but because I can't stand another day feeling like this. I feel like no one understands me and that every has their life set straight while mines is just there with no meaning. I cry everyday idk is thier someone I can reach out for help ? I am so lost....
767,hi,is it safe to post here? i could really use a friend. or someone to talk too.
768,To All Those Who Are Feeling Lost...,"Before replying individually to some messages, I would like to post a general message on this forum, to those who are considering leaving us."
769,I don't see the point anymore and I want to die.,"I'm worthless, there is nothing good about me and I'm not special. I have no talents or anything to contribute of any value. My passions and interests are gone. There is no hope for me. No one really cares about me and I'm on my own. I always will be because I am not likeable at all. I feel ugly, both physically and in personality. No one can help me and I've got no one else to blame. It's all my fault, I can't help myself."
770,what's wrong with me?,"When I look in the mirror, I don’t recognize myself anymore. The reflection looking back at me only adds to my state of sadness. My eyes are sunken in and dark circles have begun to form, despite the tan that I acquired this summer. The tan only serves as a reminder of the downward spiral that I am riding. I was so happy and content a few months ago, and now I can’t imagine what that felt like. Going to bed at night is terrifying, because I know that sleep will only bring a sequence of horrible nightmares. I had so many painful dreams about my ex last night. I also can’t stop hearing the sound of a gun loading itself. Sometimes it is a handgun, but usually it is a shotgun. Click, Boom! Click, Boom! I don’t know what it means, but I wish it would stop. It’s been going on for so long now, that it has started to occur when I am awake. I only smoked 10 cigarettes last night, which is good because the recent norm has been about a pack a day. I hate the damn things, but they provide a very temporary distraction from my emotional state. It’s hard to believe that I feel this way because of a girl. It’s true that I miss her immensely, but there is something more profound happening in my chemically imbalanced brain. I am so sad and I can’t get out of it. I’m trying, but nothing is working. I don’t know what to do. I feel like I have exhausted all of my friends with discussions about this stuff, and I have nowhere else to turn. I’ve begun to have very unpleasant thoughts about my future. I had a dream last night that I found a gun in the woods. It was loaded and I wanted to do terrible things with it."
771,Please !,"Can anyone, please, help me ?"
772,I don't know what to feel anymore.,"Third time's the charm I guess. I think I've posted here a couple times these past two years, but I've always chickened out or just deleted them for some reason or another. Well, regardless..."
773,"Will it ever end, or will I end end it?",Hi Chuckles and anyone else who can relate to what this living hell is like.
774,My lack of trust of other people is starting to make me feel like dying,"I just can't get these irrational thoughts out of my head, that no one really likes me that I'm just some walking joke. The girl I'm interested in (who has always shown signs of interest back but its complicated) hasn't been able to contact me consistently cause her sister was in the hospital and her phone's been broken. I always ask her friend for moral support and he's always been a big help but he kinda ignored the issue for a week even though I just really needed some reality. I texted him a little bit ago saying 'I'm sorry I always get so supsicious I have aspergers and I've been doing research and it's sometimes linked to not understanding others motives'. He's one of her exes and her best friend and although she struggled with coming to terms that he doesn't like her like that anymore and thinks of her as more of a sister and she likes me too he's just been making things worse lately. After that he says 'Have you heard from her? her sister's out of the hospital I bought her a huge teddy bear as a recovery gift and I've been trying to contact her'. I couldn't help but blow up in his face not some jealous fit of rage or anything but just this intense amount of fear and anxiety. I was just telling him I wasn't able to be there for her and it makes me think she'll forget every nice thing I've ever done for her and she'll just forget about me and move on. This is completely irrational for these reasons: she just told me a month ago I was the coolest guy she knows and she wants to go out with me and be happy with me but I have to meet her parents first, her parents work on an oil rig they're out of town almost all the time, she just contacted me twice last week once to tell me her sister's out of the hospital then we discussed the parents thing a little and she told me they were home for the sister thing but she had no way of contacting me. I've just been telling her friend now that I'm sorry for blowing up in his face and I don't want him to think I'm nuts or anything and if he winds up telling her I've been a wreck lately just to mention I'll probably try to get some help. Despite any positive steps I try to take along those lines I just wake up some day thinking how can I even live day to day when I feel like even people that are close to me are keeping some huge secret from me?"
775,I'm giving it time...,"This isn't the first time I have thought about leaving in fact I attempted it during my senior year of high school and I best discribe it as the day I ""snapped"" It all happened during a day were I was rejected by my crush, then discovered I was failing a class, then I found out my house was ruled condemed and the state cut off our utlities. Later that night I drank lots of pain killers with intent of going to sleep and never waking back up again, perhaps looking like I died in my sleep. The second attempt I planned was to make it look as if I was murdered. But what kept me going was the fact my oldest brother didn't graduate and I was going to be the first to do so and I did. That didn't do anything for me in life. I can't complain because I was privided for, mom did the best she could working 2 jobs and fighting off cancer to support all 4 of us."
776,I Don't Know What To Do Anymore..,I suffer from an anxiety disorder.. and it's making my depression worse..
777,Severely depressed. Not working or in school. Thinking of ending my life.,"Last year was the end of a 4 year relationship. Since then, I have not been in school or working but simply living off of family money inherited. I feel as though I am a worthless person, I am sad, tired and alone all the time unless it is the weekend and I am pretending to friends I am completely fine. My weeks are spent in my bed doing pointless things to keep my mind occupied. I have plenty of ""friends"" but no true friends. My last true friend was my ex girlfriend but we do not speak anymore and I find it very hard to do day to day things. I have no energy, I am very depressed and I do not know what to do with myself. I am not motivated in any way, I have no direction, no future, no life at this current moment and all I have been thinking about lately is who will miss me if I was gone. My family does not see me too much and they know nothing of my depression, school, lack of work or any details of my life at the moment. Surely, they will not miss me. In fact, nobody knows any of this about me since I bottle up all these feelings for fear of being judged, made fun of, cast off, etc. I am embarrassed of my entire existence as a human and feel I have not done anything with my life but spend my families money, lie, and pretend to be what I am not. I am 22 years old. I have a lot of life ahead of me and I need direction, guidance and a new beginning but I do not know how to begin or where to start. At this point, I just want to pack it in and give up; end my life."
778,always seen this section and say id never post there,"I am at my wits end and the only reason its not done is my cat. I am totally alone , destroyed , medicaitrd in some form or way, see a therapist etc. Been on here s lot and seen the whole meaning of my life pass by like balloon in the wind."
780,Parents - How long would it take to heal if your kid committed suicide?,"Ok, I was planning that when I turn 30, I would commit suicide. This is because I feel that if I can't get things together before 30, I would never do it anyway. Retirement is just a couple of years later right?"
781,This is getting to be a little much,"Ok so ive had suicidal thoughts since i was 12 im now 19 and the thoughts are getting more often and worse. At first it was over getting picked on and i just thought instead of killing myself id join the army when i was 18 and get killed in action. Back then the thoughts only came around every once in a while throughout high school the thoughts became more and more even though i had a good life going i had friends played sports and no family problems. but for some reason i would always think that life had no meaning or no point to it. i though why live if all you do is work your ass off to get money to survive and that lifes purpose was to work just to survive the next day. but then i met this amazing and beautiful girl who changed my whole thoughts on life. she made me feel like the luckiest kid in the whole world i was able to tell her everything. i thought i would be with her forever and she said the same. she made me feel good every day and gave me hope for my life i thought i found out why life had meaning. she was the first person i told that ive thought of killing myself. she got me to tell my parents i was depressed but they dont know that i wish i was dead. well recently she broke up with me and i still cry about it i feel worthless. she pretty much took back all those wonderful words that made me feel happy. she said there is no chance of getting back together and i lost it. the only way i can even be semi happy now is to distract myself with tv, school work and golf, but the rest of the day where im not doing those things i just want to die. its not like i can keep myself preoccupied every minute of everyday for the rest of my life. and the break up is not the whole reason for these awful thoughts its just the feeling of worthlessness and life not having meaning again. people say youll get over it just stick with it but i dont believe them because the thoughts have been here for 7 years now. its become to much for me, the only reason im still here is the fear of surviving suicide and not wanting to have my parents bury me. But now the things that used to hold me back are seeming like less of a good excuse to not do it. These thoughts have affected my life to much they hold me back from doing a lot of social things and the thoughts just bring my mood down even moer. If im still here by the end of the year itll because of me not wanting to hurt my family."
782,I wish I am dead...,Why? I don't know. I just wish I am... I hate my life. I hate myself. I don't know why I am here. I don't know who I am. I don't know where I am going. I just wish I am... I just wish I am....
783,I want to kill myself !!!!!!,OK i am 15 and all of my friends and family is not wanting to talk to me. This all started out by when i was dating this girl Britney then we broke up and that was a big mishap so. then she i said something about how the guy is a bad guy yet i did not know that at first so then she stop talking to me but before all of that happened with Britney. My very close friends stop talking to me so i then stopped talking to them. i now find myself as a person that no one like/ loves and well tomarrow if nothing good happened's i like kill myself with a gun. FYI i do cut and i had tryed to kill myself 3 times now and my mom put me in the mental hospital so ya....
784,Ever FEEL Blue,Ever feeel blue
785,Can OCD return after I ceased treatment?,"I have obsessive compulsive behavior, and had it since I was a kid.Back when I was 15(I'm 21 now) it has gotten pretty bad(that is when I was diagnosed with it)."
786,I don't belong here,"Lately I have been feeling like I don't belong in this world. I am depressed and just want out. It seems like I have started college my life is no life. I really don't have someone to go out with on the weekends like I use to. I feel like everyone is enjoying there life while I am just here watching them have fun. I feel like if I were gone nobody would care. I need help I want to be like I use to be but I feel like I can never be her agian, I feel ugly. I don't know what to do !!"
787,Someone please help me....I literally do not know what to do,"I've never put myself down as one of these people who likes to open up about matters, in fact I much rather brush it under the carpet in the hope that the matter will disappear over night - but I've been told on numerous occasions that confession is good for the soul and I am hoping that this email will some how allow me take steps in the direction I want - failing that I am starting to scare myself in what I could be capable of unless I get an outsiders point of view - or at least something that tells me that I can become the person I want to be."
789,I have a plan. I have a date... and this scares me.,"I plan to enjoy my birthday, Christmas, and New Years... and at the end of January, after my lover skips town. I plan to hurtle myself off of the edge of the mountain i reside on. I know that I shouldn't be thinking this way... but I am and that frightens me. This is my cry out for help I suppose."
790,There is really just no point in living anymore,"Basically, I've had a hard life. With an alcoholic and abusive mother, to being bullied in school, to a severe eating disorder through high school, to being hated by everyone as some examples, it has all just messed me up forever. When I started university in a new country I thought this was my time to start new, I could be the person I want to be and could leave all my problems behind. I came and really put myself out there, was as nice and sociable as I could be to try and make a lot of new friends and to get my life on track. Yet somehow, no matter how hard I try, people just don't seem to like me? I honestly don't know why because I act just the same as everyone else yet they are all well liked and have lots of close friends but I always spend my life alone."
791,Frantic and hopeless,Never thought i'd be writing in this forum.
792,Why not?,"Is it OK to come here and whine? I was happy to be ugly for a while until some research I did pointed out to me what it actually means to be ugly. When you start to realize that you will be alone forever, and there's nothing you can do, it weighs on you a bit. Suicide is starting to seem like a better and better idea every day. In fact, it feels irresponsible to not kill myself. I have done some research into reasons to not kill myself and everything I've found has fallen into one of three categories."
793,Need legal information on how to arrange my death and funeral please.,I am currently a college student in Western Maryland.
794,Thinking about over-dosing today,"I have been thinking very seriously about ending my life for quite a while now. I'm thinking about doing it today. All of my problems would go away. Some might say my problems are temporary but they're not. I've had many of the same problems for quite a while now. I struggle with bipolar disorder and have tried meds and therapy, yada, yada, yada. My last therapist told me that she didn't see any problems with my life and she didn't know why I was there, so I quit going. I got laid off from my job in the biotech field 14 months ago and I've had one interview since then. I was living in a very conservative city, but after getting laid off I had to move out of my own apt. and move back home with family in a small town in a very conservative area because I couldn't afford where I was living with no job. I have a graduate degree and I went back for more education to finish a double BS in biotech and biology, and I was pursuing this when I was laid off. I'm about 2 semesters away from finishing. But, I've had a lot of problems with professors these last 2 years, harassing me in their courses, getting students to harass me in their courses, problems with them knowing personal things about me that I never told anyone at my school, my assignments suddenly disappearing after I turn them in. I'm also a lesbian and even though I haven't dated anyone in 5 years, it seems the status of my sexuality has come out as I've been experiencing a lot of harassment at the restaurant where I've been working as a server these last 7 months. I'm only out to a few family and friends and I've experienced a lot of rejection and lost a lot of friends after coming out. My family hasn't been supportive about it either. My mom acts like she's afraid to touch me or hug me any more and she always says, ""I don't know why you would choose to be gay? Why can't you just find a nice man to be with?"" The thought of being with a man is repulsive to me. After I came out, my mom called my grandma and aunt to tell them the news and then they told other family members. Everyone treats me differently now and I can hear them snickering about it at family get-togethers."
795,Attempted Suicide ...,"About 2 months ago I had a really bad time, a lot of stress with school, work, kids and my husband (mostly fighting with my husband) and a fight with a friend of mine.. I ended up going home and having a few drinks and got more depressed and wanted to go to sleep so I smoked a bowl, then took a few vicodin, then really just didn't want to wake up anymore so I popped a handful of xanax and paxils and about 4 more vicodin."
796,alt. suicide?,yes i do wanna kill myself but i just dont want people to have to deal with me doing it myself. Surely im not the only one who wishes and truck would run me over or get shot at a gas station or something of the sort?
797,I don't see the point anymore,"I don't know how to cope anymore. It's been nearly 7 weeks since I was dumped by my boyfriend of 4 years. We were living together and have now found our own places to flat with other people. I'm finding it near impossible to be without him. He was such a huge part of my life. I have attempted suicide twice since the breakup and tried saying goodbye to my ex but he wouldn't allow it and came to find me and he called the police. My life is just a mess at the moment. I'm in my last semester of university before I graduate and I have to keep my grades up to pass. I can't concentrate as he is always on my mind. I no longer see the point in doing anything as I think to myself, what's the point in living if I can't be with the one I love?"
798,I am an absolute ****ty human being and I don't deserve life,"I'm 25, unemployed, single, broke, in debt to my eyeballs....and I don't know where I went wrong or when I became the this...person I've become. I do know what I've done wrong, I just don't know how to stop myself from doing it. Like I know it's wrong and I feel bad doing it...anyway, let me explain."
799,Ready to give up,Pretty much every day i have felt like giving up. Hits me hard. especially today. Im not sure if i would actually try it soon. Its getter harder to bounce back...
800,"Dont want to live anymore, but cant kill myself","I;m in a tough spot. I have no interest in living, but cant kill myself. I dont know what to do"
801,Not sure what to do....,"So I found this site while googling whether or not I should go to inpatient treatment. I hardly know where to start, so I guess I'll start near the beginning. Also, I wasn't sure whether to post in the self injury thread or this one, but I think my biggest issue falls into this one. My questions are at the bottom."
802,Can't stand it anymore,"2-1/2 months ago I was suicidal but, obviously didn't end up committing suicide. This past week has been the worst I have ever had and getting away from it all would be really nice right about now. I have pain killers can take that would do the trick, but I don't know if I can because of my friends. My family doesn't care and my boyfriend probably wouldn't notice."
803,How do I help my friend?,"This is just hurting my heart. I'm doing everything I can think of, and just one of those things is to ask you guys for advice."
804,Learn from my mistakes,
805,There feels like no way out,"I could probably stop at the title alone, and it's painful to go into full detail about all the things that are hurting me to this point. I don't want to live anymore, yet i'm afraid to take my life. I wrote a suicide note which felt weird but i still have it weeks later. I feel powerless to confront those who hurt and wronged me....hell, it's hard to say that because i feel like I'm unfairly blaming people for things. But the thing is, I blame people for the wrongs they cause; it's my choice to take my life and i don't blame anyone for that. I just wish the pain would stop. Sorry for being vague but like i said, it is hard to say everything because i feel somewhat ashamed."
806,I feel nothing,"Hello, everybody."
807,i want to end it,"i want to end my life..there is nothing to live for. its all a blank..i am so numb..i feel like i am watching myself from outside and all i see is a loser.someone who has fu**ed up every thing in her life, made evry wrong decision, screwed up everything. now theres nothing more too live for. my parents hate me..i and my partner hate each other..i have no friends, no job, no life..nothing.."
808,I really want to kill myself now.,"I'm always alone, my parents are divorced and my mother doesn't come home from work until I'm asleep. I've talked to my teachers, social worker, guidance counselor and my mother. It seems like no one cares. Whenever I try to make friends it always seems like once class is done or when it comes to group activities they leave me out on purpose. I don't know if it's my generation but it seems I have nothing in common with anyone I meet. The kids I meet are always either into drugs/alcohol/fights or into getting ""1337 no scopes"" (whatever that is). Then there's these 11th/12th graders who make fun of me because I'm Asian and my passion for singing. I guess I could factor in that ever since I've gotten gangbanged and sent to the hospital I've become socially awkward. I'm always alone in my passion for singing and breakdancing, I never use to be like this until I moved. I want to move but I can't because of my horrible attendance. And yes I'm skipping school because every time I go to school I feel much worse then the previous time. I'm just contemplating about killing myself right now since it seems like nobody cares about me and killing myself won't really affect everyone around me. What's the point in living when I can end my suffering right now..."
809,So lonely I could die.,"I feel incredibly lonely. Idk what this feeling is, I've never felt anything as strong as this before. I just feel so empty and alone. Like, no one cares. No one wants to care. And I'm not worth anyone caring. I'd rather be dead because I wouldn't feel like this. I take sleeping pills before I go to bed"
810,I want to die,"I want to die. i've been here before two years ago, and i overdoesed. I never thought it would be here, but i've no choice, its better, its far better than living, and i have a son and i hate myself for thinking this way, but my life is nothing, like nothing!!!!!!!!!! If i didn't have him i would be dead now, but i want to be, that is slefish and believe me, he is the love of my life, but i can't stop thia feeling,m i've tried, i can't say and he is a strong person, i've created this amazing person, who is my life, but i know i'm going to hold himback, i've build him up and i'm going to let him down, cause i'nm weak, i'm weak and he deserves better than me, he's y baby and he deservess better than this!!!!"
811,I wished I had a gun,"Okay, let me explain what happenned."
812,this is it,ive always found some reason to hang on

814,I finally found a way,"I have waited along time for things to get better. Alot of difficult years have gone and Im still a total failure. I have made 3 worthless attempts, pills twice and slit my wrist once within the past few months, to no avail. now I finally found the best way."
815,My life is not worth living anymore,"I'm a 23-year-old medical student, who has been recently diagnosed with PTSD and serious depression. I would really appreciate if you read my story and gave me some advice regarding getting over these disturbing thoughts of killing myself. Because this is a long post, I've marked the section that has some information about my major childhood and teen-year issues with dashed lines. The more important section is the latter one, which I hope is not too long to read."
816,feeling incredibly low/suicidal over ex boyfriend,Its 4 months since me and my ex broke up
817,Continuous suicidal thoughts,Even if the ones I'm having now subside they'll only resurface again. I'm sure one day I will go ahead with it. There are only so many times you can want to do it and then back out. After a good cry things seem better but why do I have to cry all the time. I cry to the point of wanting to throw up and sometimes I do. I'm only 20 what sort of life is this. I've been going through a lot of pain over the past 3/4 years.
818,Dark thoughts,"Well never thought I'd be posting here, but I can't ignore these feelings anymore cause they are starting to scare me. I will have on almost a daily basis now suicidal thoughts. I think of how, where, and when would be a good time to do it. I almost have fantasies about going on some exotic destination for a vacation and living it up and then doing the deed there. I am shocked and surprised at these thoughts I am having, and I am really confused about it all."
819,I cant go on,"I dont feel like i can go on any longer. Ive got nobody anymore. Ive isolated myself by severing all my friendships. I used to have loads of friends but one by one ive pushed them away. Then i stopped talking to my mum, dad and brother about 18 months ago. Now my partner has left me. The less i talk and socialise with people the more recluse i become and the more depresseed i feel. its like a vicious circle. It just seems that ive been pushing myself back into this corner of isolation and now i have no-one i feel empty. My life has been really traumatic and i feel that ive ruined it by the things ive done and choices ive made. Im 34 years old now and my life is in tatters and i have nobody - not even my family. i dont want to go on anymore. i just want to end it all because theres no point. Ive ruined my life and think its probably better for everyone if im gone and not a burden on their lives. Nobody likes me anyway. All i ever think about is hanging myself to end it all. I think everybody dies one day anyway so wwhy not now. why carry on with this hopeless life being a burden and disappointment to people. i really want to go"
820,Laws don't help people like me.,"So I've been having bouts of depression and I want counseling, but I looked at my local laws and now I know if I actually told them what I was thinking they'd be bound by law to report it. I just need a little help, I'm angry, depressed and I feel so hopeless. Like there's no way out without facing some consequences I don't deserve. My life is mine, I'll take it if I want. But I'd rather just live well."
821,HELP my friend is talking about suicide...,"my friend, who I have been best friends with for 20 years, has recently graduated college. her family is not the most supportive, and the people she works with take advantage of her kindness. lately, i've been noticing her comments about suicide, hurting herself, and she says she has no purpose in life. it's usually when shes intoxicated, however, shes a shy person and i think this is when her true feelings come out. after talking to her tonight, i'm terrified, and scared of what she may be capable of."
822,Alone and feeling worthless,I am a 40 yr old woman with no kids andy today I was told I am going through menopause I feel less than human I hate myself I want to die please help me
824,Not alone? I am always alone.,"I don't know where to start or end this. One place to start: I hate myself,I always have and I have a feeling I always will. And I come to realize it more and more about how much I don't care about myself, and how I care more about others. You see my life is pointless. I've figured out that all along god never existed. I used to hope and doubt that god existed but last month something clicked in me. I told myself that all along I was looking for nothing, and now I can't bring back that feeling of the doubtful hope that I had in god. I hate it. I feel like I've figured it all out and I feel so empty now. I wish I hadn't...that's just another reason to give up life. Another is my social life...my friends are horribly ignorant people who laugh pointlessly at everything and live carelessly. I act just like them. All happy and * * * * . But honestly I just want them to shut the hell up and see reality. I'd rather be talking about politics and religion and all those innocent people dying in pointless wars everyday. I feel like I am wasting time, like I shouldn't be sitting here in school learning * * * * . I should be be out there in the real helping people through things like war and oppression. The people in the U.S are blind to the true realities of the world. And I'd rather die then just sit here and watch innocent people suffer. And honestly Ive been thinking about that a lot lately. Because I can't help. I am a hopeless nobody. I had dreams. But they seem so fictitious. I mean I'm in high school, I'm 16 and my dream was to become a trauma surgeon. It won't happen. I know it. My grades arent bad but to get a career like that you need to have perfect grades. There's so many reasons why though. Like how my love life is always because both of the guys I have liked are drug addicts. I can never find anyone to relate to and have a decent conversation with. And I hate sitting here and watch the world pass by me...and watch all my classmates succeed and stay happy like they always were. I want to die for so many reasons. I've been thinking of ways to do it. The least painful. I want everyone to see me dead. Because as much as they may say they care, all these friends only pretend they knew and make up fake stories about what an amazing person I was when honestly it's just * * * * that's covering up how much they hate me. They just say that stuff to make themselves look like they give a * * * * , but they just want other people's empathy. I want my parents to see my dead body and see that all these strict restrains they had on me werent ever from the better. This was the only reality they couldn't prevent from happening. They would surprised because I seemed like a such a happy person, despite the fact that I had a suicidal past. They would remember all the times I had told them ""I am going to commit suicide if this or that happens"" they thought everything I said was joke. They always did. They took me for a joke, and they always say that I am the worst thing that ever happened to them. It's always about my perfect sister... * * * * this bringing back * * * * I didn't want toremember...makes me want to * * * * ing kill myself this second. Besides...I do want to see what was always going on on the other sides ......ugh"
825,Tic tac.....,"I knew I wrote a note just a few days ago. I just saw the movie “To save a life”. And I just feel so sick.. The movie were nice, I kind of like it but it just didn’t caught me.. I didn’t feel that make me change my decision. I know, some day, soon, I’ll make it. I’m tired of telling me that “it’s going to be good” some day. It’s not. Tired of them telling me I just have to put in some work to make a change. There is no way to change things. I’m to ragged. I usually compare it to a shoe. Image you have a shoe that you brought at some low price shop. The shoe really bad quality that you’ll not be surprised if is broken the next day. When you had wear it for a long time its total tear in to pieces there is no way the shoemaker could fix it. Even if you try to fix it, it would only tear apart, cause of the bad quality. That same about me, I’m to ragged to fix. There are too many things that I just can’t fix. It’s hard to explain and some things have been there to long and have made too much of trouble. There is now way I could repair.."
826,Everything. Addicted and worthless.,"For the record, I feel stupid posting here. As if some random people on the internet will be able to help me. But this is a challenge to all you enotalone lurkers. Give me something, anything that'll lift my spirits or some sort of practical advice. Because this is the best I could do, my one last shot of hope, of salvation before I lose my mind and do something I'll regret. I can't talk to anybody because I would feel stupid. Everyone who goes to counselors is usually just butt-hurt because their ""soul"" mate left them for some schmooze. I don't know. I can't feel anything anymore."
827,Stuck between not wanting to live and hoping that maybe things will get better,"Hi everyone. I can't really discuss this issue with my family. I've tried with friends but it seems like they dont really understand. I've thought about ending my life so many times during the past 3 months. I'm 22 and 5 months ago my ex-fiance proposed to me a month after he moved to LA, California. He proposed a plan that i would move there in August after i graduated from college and did not want me to transfer out there before i graduated because it would make transferring my credits difficult. I didnt worry too much because I was confident that our love was strong enough to survive 6 months apart. I love this man more than i love myself and was happy when he proposed because i want to spend the rest of my life with him. We had also lost the baby that i was carrying almost 2 years before the move so seeing him so involved to want to marry me and start the family that we always wanted just made me so happy. 3 months ago I received a text message saying that he didnt want to be with me anymore without any explanation. He had began becomng emotionally and mentally abusive to me a few weeks before the breakup and then would apologize saying that he didnt mean to be so mean to me, and because i loved him, I still stood by him."
828,I don't want to be alone anymore,hey guys
829,The last straw,**** Warning: Lengthy post *****
830,That's it I've had it,"My first time posting here and let me just say, I WISH I WAS DEAD!!"
831,My son constantly threatens suicide,He's been doing this for 9 years. To say this has affected my health is putting it mildly. I do not know where to post this so I'm putting it here. I just needed to vent
832,Suicide by DUI?,"Hello All,"
833,Almost killed myself while abroad. Locked door prevented it..,"I was in Spain with family for the last two and a half weeks. I was miserable, had nothing to do, and drank very frequently while there."
834,This is my note,"All the times I've started one of these, I've never quite wrote what I really felt. I would hold back, either trying to spare feelings or not wanting people to know how I truly felt. The other day, I realized that if anyone does read this, I'll be dead. Why should I care what people think if I'm dead. I spent too much time when I was alive worrying about what other people think, no need for that now."
835,hate this feeling!!!,okay my first post...as you can tell by my name i have bipolar im 21y.o girl...got told i had it when i was 16 yeah young but i wasnt well...im on
836,"Life worsens, wants to commit suicide HELP","Well I am 18 years old and my life continues to worsen. I will explain a bit about myself and the reasoning behind my dark temptations of commiting such a terrible act. Ever since I was 11 years old I have suffered severe epilepsy to the point where I have grand mal (intense convulsion) seizures daily. My school has always been interrupted, constantly made fun of by other people. My memory is worsening and so is my hearing. I have had severe side effects from almost every possible epileptic medication there is and now I do not really see a point in living. Not only do I deal with seizures but I deal with other stresses such as my family which is extremely poor at the moment since one of my parents lost their job and a sibling which seems to have deep hatred for me; probably because they haven't matured and may be jealous of the attention I receive for having such a disorder. I still am not sure. But I hate my life. I have called suicide hotlines and everything but I truly just hate myself."
837,I want to kill myself-- not sure why I do though.,"For the past month, I have had on and off feelings of wanting to kill myself. The thing is, I could never bring myself to do it. I also feel like I have no reason to feel like this."
838,counting days,I am thinking about killing myself. My current abusive boyfriend has a set of knives that are stainless steel and so sharp you will cut your finger if you run it accross it. They belonged to his mom there a special edition knife set. The smallest one is curved that if you wanted to slit your wrist it would fall into the curves of my wrist all I would need to do is slide it.
839,I don't understand why everything goes wrong for me.,Out of all the people I was around I've been considered the strongest and most wise because mentally I could not be broken down in the past and
840,I Just Want To Die,I am a young lady. Thats really all you need to know.
841,Worried about ex,"Ok, my ex and I have been broken up for a few months and, although the breakup was really hard for me at first, I've accepted it and feel happy again--happier than I've felt in a long time, including most of the time we were together."
842,Can someone please tell me the world isn't that bad,"I think I am addicted to making myself unhappy. I try not to watch or read the news because its never good and it makes me depressed, but I can't stop. I'm drawn to the stories that will make me have a negative reaction. For instance, today I clicked on a story about women's rights in the military and I read all the comments people made. Bad idea because every other one was some sort of sexist rant. Things like that make me really upset, and hate men, or wish I was one so I wouldn't have to deal with these feelings. I knew beforehand there would be comments like that, but I read them anyway. I'm loosing faith in humanity. I'm not sure I want to live in this world. I don't think I would take my own life, but if I happened to die an early death it would be all for the better. I don't think i'm strong enough to survive in a world where people kill, rape, steal, and generally tear each other down. But all these feelings right now are a result of reading all that crap. I try to tell myself that there are good people in the world too, but on some level I can't let myself believe it."
843,I can't take this anymore!!! What can I do!?,"I've posted in here before so some of you might remember my story. Basically, I am almost 39 years old, working a crappy paying part time job, living with my mom, who has friends that treat me like * * * * . I have no hope for my future at all. I want to die now more than I ever have. The only thing that keeps me from doing it is the thought of my family crying over my casket. I don't want to do that to them, but I also can't keep living like this. I am at my lowest low right now. I am trying so hard to compose coherent sentences, all I wanna do is cry, scream, break things, run away, or go park my car in the garage with the door shut and take deep breaths. I honestly don’t know how long I can continue living my life. I can feel my entire body filling up with what feels like evil, it makes me feel sick, it makes me feel like I have thick black goop running through my veins, it makes my throat feel like it’s closing up, it makes my head feel like 1000 gallons of tears could come bursting out of it at any time…and there is no way to make all this * * * * go away!! I am stuck in my body, I can’t get out, and I can’t make all this * * * * get out of me! I can’t even cry right now because I * * * * ing live with my mom and she could walk in on me anytime!! * * * * !!!!!!"
844,how do i keep going,i look at my scars on my arms everyday....scars all the way down....double edge razor....60 plus stitches each arm... blood transfusion...one year ago...almost died...many times still wish i had...I don't want any sympathy please....I just feel my family would be better off without a mom who was depressed all the time....who can't get outa bed....can't shower...can't take care of them....
845,overdosing,"What would happen if someone took 20 seroquel pills that are 25mg each if the person is only prescribed 25mg a day? Just looking for a bit of advise, thanks"
846,I can't...,"I can't go on.... I've got no future, I've got no family, and I'm not getting any healthier.... I can't find anyone who understands... I've got mesothelioma... Stage 3 Lung cancer... My girlfriend of years left me because of this... She wants to be friends, that tears me apart inside... I'm alone... I don't want to wake up in the morning anymore, and when I do it takes longer and longer to get up... The aches are more achey, and the pains are more painful, and its becoming more apparent that I'm dying alone... 20... Alone... I've never even.. You know... Was going to wait till we got married, or at least I paid my car off and could provide a stable house... I guess this is it..."
847,Talk to me,"I tried to kill myself a few weeks ago. I don't mean thought about it I mean I really tried and it just didn't work. I know my posts aren't very pleasant here. But this is supposed to be a place where people offer support and I can just leave my troubles so I don't have to talk about them and mess up my relationships. I can't see a therapist right now; it's complicated. Not taht I'm unwilling, I just CAN'T. I have not told anyone about what happened though; I tried to talk to one friend but now I'm being ignored. I would just really like to tell someone what happened. I know it's stupid but it'd mean a lot to me."
848,If i tried again...it wouldnt be the first attempt,"20 years old, married and has a 9month old. The world is * * * * and the only reason i have not drank my self to death or overdosed is because of my husband and child but at this point i don't even know if i am good for them. My own family hates me and i cant get a good job. I cant go to college to get a good job because i don't have money because i don't have a job. Ever since i moved out of my moms house and got married i have come to reality with the fact that our world is just a * * * * cycle! Nothing fixes it because EVERYTHING is * * * * . I know my child and husband would miss me dearly but at this point i am no help to them, i am so stressed that the littlest noise makes me jump because my nerves are so bad, my face twitches uncontrollably, my emotions are so unstable that i am crying one second and laughing the next (serious). I don't even know why i am writing this, guess its caus i cant get my hands on any hard drugs, so i have to just stick around till then i guess...."
850,i dont know anymore,"compared to many people. my life is awesome. im a 15 year old boy, rich, have tons of friends, and yet right at the start of may i became depressed now a night doesn't go by where i dont think about what it would be like to kill myself. i have never been bullied, i have never been neglected or disliked and i have my 3 best friends (who are girls) i tell everything. i have so many things to be happy about yet im not enjoying anything life offers me anymore. i started doing drugs, and it didnt really change anything. it helped for like 40 minutes. so i stopped. now i spend each day putting a mask on. with my family and friends i act like the old happy fun guy i used to be. but at night when noone can see me i become depressed, sad and angry at everything and i just want to kill myself. at the start of may i also got insomnia and i havnt slept a single night this summer more that 5 hours. i only sleep 0-5 hours a night. and thats not helping anything. i feel like there is no meaning for my existence. im just another drugged up teenager who doesnt care about anything. my favorite teacher ever showed me a quote."
852,Die or what is wrong?,"Is a slightly confused at the moment. But not confused enough not to be ""clear head"" or could act rationally."
853,back to the bottom of my cycle....,"so i've realized (a couple times now) that i have an emotional cycle. its not a roller coaster because it doesnt start and end. it just goes round and round and round and there is nothing i can do about it. basically what happens is my life starts taking a downward turn. and not just like something bad here and there. its everything at once. my job goes to hell, my family starts acting like they dont care anymore, i cant find any friends to talk to, my depression gets bad, i loose my girlfriend or prospect of a girlfriend, i run out of money....and it all happens at the same time. what sucks is that after all this stuff happens everything starts getting better again. i magically have friends, my family starts being there for me, i get a new job or a raise, girls start just showing up my depression goes away, everything just goes wonderfully for a while. here's the catch. there is a perfect pattern that keeps happening (3 times now since i noticed it) there are 2 turning points. when my life starts going to hell it keeps getting worse and worse until i decide i want to kill myself. and not just like thinking about it. i have to come up with a plan and be just about to off myself when suddenly everything just falls into place and my life is wonderful. the turning point when things start getting worse again is when i decide that i am going to not kill myself. and these changes happen almost instantly. i mean its within 6 hours of me making the decisions that everything just flips around. so right now i'm heading down a bad spiral that is going to end up with me wanting to kill myself. oh and by the way i have tested this theory out last time it happened by deciding at the beginning that no matter what i was going to keep my chin up and not kill myself. but life just kept getting worse until i finally gave up and was ready to die. then that day i got a phone call from a girl and she wanted to hang out so she could kiss me. the next day every other piece of my life fell into place. and just as perfectly as that worked out as soon as i admitted that things were going good and i wanted to keep living... crap hit the fan within 12 hours. so now i'm headed back down the path to wanting to die and right now i want to just skip the part where my life gets progressively worse and just end the cycle and off myself. but unfortunately i'm a nice guy and for some messed up reason i cant shake the habit of considering other peoples happiness over my own. so i've been sticking around because my grandpa wants me to."
855,at the end of my rope here...,"i think that my depression comes from a different place than some others. i am not saying that i am better than them, because that simply is not true. i just feel that it isn't one of those situations that you can push through or hang on tight until it is over, because it never will be. let me explain: i have irritable bowel syndrome. it is bad to me, although i'm sure others have it worse. i am grateful, but the constant nausea, abdominal pain, and other side effects and making things quite unbearable. i have no social life. i've tried tons and tons of medications, none of which did much good. the solution would seem to be just go to the doctor and get something else, right? problem is that my condition prevents me from working, but i am unable to qualify for disability. that means no insurance, no money, pretty much just draining away at this point. my parents have been supporting me ever since and i'm 25 now, 26 soon, and i'm in quite a bind... and my insides are churning around, making it quite miserable on a regular basis."
856,Don't know what to do!,"Hi everyone,"
857,Fantasy of suicide becomes more vivid,Typing this on my phone. Bare with me.
858,I am at that precipice teetering on the edge...,I've tried calling all my friends... everyone is with family or their significant other. I invited them over tomorrow so I could have something to be accountable for... none of them can come.
859,I just want someone to be there.,Where to begin...
860,never been the same,"ever since I become older my beliefs have changed drastically for the worst. I used to believe in fate and everything having a reason for happening. Now I realize I make my own choices. Ever since I realized that I have been stuck, anxious and so unhappy. I liked the idea of ""God"" being there for me, helping me write my story as I go along. now nothing has any color, spark or anything. It all feels dead, meaningless, and pointless. I am ready to end it all soon."
861,Burden has ruined me!,"For many years, I had to shoulder the constant, neverending burden of an aging grandmother with dementia (who passed away this past March). This terrible onus just fell upon me. My mother died many years ago and my aunt was estranged from the family. Naturally, everything, from watching over her to monitoring her homes, to paying her bills and so on fell squarely on me. This heavy weight became so severe that I couldn't pay any attention to my own issues (professional like work, social like friendships and relationships and my health)."
862,Tired of Life,"I have seriously considered taking my life. Life is sheer hell for me. Im 15 and transgender and have barely any friends. Everywhere i go everyone hates me and makes fun of me everyday. My parents dont listen to me, I tell them i hate life but they dont believe me. They dont believe me when i say everyone hates me. They dont understand me at all. Every night i got to sleep thinking tomorrow is going to get better but it's worse then the next day. I never have good days and im constantly unhappy. My only friend that knows keeps telling me to tell someone but no listens. My parents are anti-trans and wouldn't accept me. I hate myself as well. I dont look female at all and growing too tall. I wish this pain would stop but it doesn't. I also have no dreams or expectations, I figured i wouldnt live past 21 so i have no future plans. As you can read my life really sucks. All i really want is someone to talk to. Because i'm really tired of life right now"
863,"This is it, I'm doing it","I suffer severely from depression and am addicted to cutting. I've been in a mental ward twice and the hospital four times for trying to kill myself. I can't live anymore... I just can't. I am 14 years old and have fallen in love with two girls, suffered, recovered and now I've fallen again. This time for a 20 yr old. We both like eachother and if it weren't for our age gap we'd be together. My parents found out how much I like him and have made me cut off all contact with him, his family and friends. His little sister is devastated, she loves me like a sister. I've ruined my relashionship with them completely. I have to be supervised by my parents in everything I do. The only way I'm wrighting this is by hiding in the bathroom with my iPod. This is all my fault. It's my fault my parents found out how much I like him because I'm not good at hiding it."
864,life is pointless,Everything is crashing my job my living situation and I pushed away the love of my life I hate my self I'm preying she is pregnant but she really doesn't want it how can I stay positive for a baby that she doesn't want to carry.I cant afford my counsler I'm just ready to go it all gets worst it never gets better just fake smiles for a few days I'm waiting for God but if a random person shoots me then its gods time right I just don't get it. I have zero reasons to try
866,Last resource,"I don't know what to do anymore. It feels like I can't go forward. Nothing is right anymore. Nothing at all. I'm back with my brothers and the abuse is too much. He keeps telling me how worthless I am, how I am the cause of everyone's problems, how I'm disgusting, how I should just die. And he's right. My aunt is with us... the one I keep trying to help, trying to hang out with... try to love. And yet she laughed at me. She agreed with my brother. I snapped. We were having dinner and I threw the plate at him. I then went to my aunt and yelled at her face that it wasn't funny. I can't stop crying now. I can't move. I can't leave. I'm trapped inside this life, inside this body I hate. I can't control myself anymore. I can't control my emotions at all. I want to die. I want a break. I want to just sleep and never wake up. I want to live inside my head."
867,how bad does it have to get?,"Layers and layers, years and years, heartbreak, pain, shame, regret, and everything. Therapy doesn't help. Nor do drugs."
868,I need someone to talk to/help,"I've thought about killing myself for a few years now, when I was a teenager, I didn't think I would live past 21 - since I always planned on killing myself by then. I am 23 and all I want to do is die. I have had my heart ripped out by a guy I loved and spent 2 and a half years, with I thought he loved me too but it was all a lie. I have nothing to live for now. My parents and family will move on, so I don't feel bad about leaving them, my friends will soon forget about me. So really I have nothing to live for. I have please my parents already by going to university and getting the education they wanted me to get. I have never been able to follow my dreams and do what I wanted to do. I don't even know who I am, what I like, what makes me happy. All I know is what other people have me to believe, I have no special talents, I'm not special, I'm just me mediocre in every way. I just need to find the strength to take my own life. Life has no meaning when you have no one to talk to, to confide in, to trust with your most intimate secrets. I can't tell my parents, they are too judgemental to understand and I'm pretty sure my friends don't care. I wish I could die in my sleep or something, that way I could be dead without killing myself."
869,Death.,"What is death ? The body stops functioning, gets hardened and all. But what is it that dies? The answers lies in knowing what is it that lives ? At the poing we can only assume about what would happen when death approaches us, a better thing would be to investigat what is it that lives ?"
870,My daughter's herion addiction,"To start, I have never done anything like this before. I am a very heartbroken mother, that doesn't think I can handle the pain much more. I have been dealing with my daughter's addiction since the end of 2008. She has been in rehab 3 times. She states she wants to be clean and live a normal life, but whenever she gets on her feet (usually 2 weeks clean), she blows it. She was just thrown out of her last program Sunday. She is now, for the 1st time, living on the streets. Everyone keeps telling me that I can't go save her or help her because it just sets her up for failure again."
871,i dont know what to do!,"hey im having alot of problems! pretty much my whole life has been crap ive been through adoption my father molested me when i was young. been raped, sexually assulted many times moved out with my boyfriend which we are probably almost done anyways my family has abandoned me for taking up for him my mom thinks im a * * * * . i dont have nothing to live for it seems like. nothing is going to get any better ive never had anyone that i could trust. i dont even have good friends that i could hang out with. if me and my boyfriend break up i dont know where i would go bc i cant go back to my family bc they all think that i turned my back on them and they are all very mad at me and probably wont ever forgive me. all i wanted was for my family to get alone with my boyfriend and it seems like thats never going to happen bc they keep tlking about him. i feel like im a bad person all together and i dont deserve to live anymore i hate my life"
872,Not sure where to go from here . . .,"I am in a dark place right now. Nothing in my life brings me any semblence of happiness. I recently got out of an abusive relationship back in May. I tried getting a job and failed miserably. I have no money left and I had to move back in with my parents. My parents are mentally and emotionally abusive and they're toxic to me, but I had no choice. It was either move home or live on the streets. I have no friends that I can talk to. They're all busy with their own lives and none are willing to listen. I have no one to support me. I'm completely alone."
873,"entertaining the idea, feelings of worthlessness.","This is something I can't believe I'm writing out, but I'm feeling so hopeless."
874,I wish I'm,I feel like giving up. I'm tired. I don't think I can make it. I feel like dying. I feel hopeless. Worthless. I wish I'm dead
875,I don't know what to do.,"Two months ago my girlfriend of 16 months broke up with me out of the blue. I had been having a very difficult time with finals for my senior year of college, but everything had seemed fine until she didn't come home until 6-7ish in the morning two nights in a row, which was very unusual behavior for her. That's when she told me she didn't feel like she wanted to date me anymore, broadsiding me completely. She had said she wanted to figure out what she needed in her life at the moment, and I was willing to respect it, however brokenhearted I felt. I was really busted up that day, and moved out to stay with my parents so that she would still have a place to stay. I managed to hang in there for a week while one of my friends came up to help me through it, but a week later on graduation I woke up to a Facebook status telling e she was in a new relationship. A relationship with a mutual friend, who we had also been planning on living with. I've been on a downward spiral ever since. All of my long term plans had included her, and now I've found myself shoved aside for another guy. Everything that I used to do to amuse myself has become as appealing as eating ash. I see a therapist weekly, and have been for the past three years, but I find that it helps less and less. I feel like a complete waste of life, I can't motivate myself to look for a job, have any optimism, or even get out of the house. I feel like a walking corpse, and the desire to kill myself has done nothing but grow over the past two months."
876,don't know how much more i can take...,"i've been teetering on the edge for some time now and i can't take it. i don't know how much longer i can hold on. i'm in such physical and mental agony, it is excruciating. doctors can't seem to help. i don't know what to do. i have nothing to look forward to, and i dread the mornings which is when i feel the worse. i try to sleep a lot but i wake up off and on throughout the night with pains. i've seen about five different doctors, and still nothing. i've been to the hospital a couple times, even to see a specialist, and i'm seeing a surgeon tomorrow, but day to day it is intolerable. i don't know what to do."
878,I need advice please...,"Hello there,"
880,I wish human euthanization was legal.,"I'm so depressed, that I find myself useless in today's society. I don't have kids, and I'm thinking that I'm never going to be well enough to raise any. Sometimes I find joy in life, but it never lasts... it doesn't lasts more than a day."
881,whats from here,"i lived a LONG 19 years i have experienced almost everything but yet i find no satisfaction in anything except pain of my own or others. sometimes i dont feel human like its not real any more im just a walking zombie. the only thing i had was my girlfriend and after our fight today shes gone for sure. today i was so high before i realized to myself ""this is it this my pleasure"" and i dont wanna be a junkie but if went clean i would kill myself or someone else im positive i tried .when i was 14 i was rushed to the hospital after i stabed my self in the leg 4 inches deep and lost 3 pints of blood but the thing was if a near death experience didnt help me value life what possibly could??"
882,It doesn't matter if you love him or capital Him,I'm feeling particularly depressed tonight after seeing my friends beautiful wedding pictures. How come I don't get to have a beautiful wedding and lose my virginity to my husband?
883,Boyfriend just tried to arrange a suicide pact with me,"My boyfriend (shall refer to him as Z) has a lot of issues and so this has lead to depression, and occasionally leads to him contimplating suicide, and I am the same. We got into a fight tonight over my last ex, in that Z was comparing himself to my ex due to certain areas of our relationship. He suddenly began to feel useless and a waste and pain to me and to the world, I tried to cheer him up but failed, and he began wanting to committ suicide again."
884,The person that loves me is constantly breaking my heart....,"I just got married in Jan of this year. I have had a crappy life and I really thought that I had found the person that I knew I deserved. I LOVE HIM!!! He is so good to me most of the time. He has never hit me, screamed at me or called me ugly names. The problem is my family. He doesn't like them and I don't think that he ever will. Anytime anything comes up about my family we end up mad at each other. My family has put me through hell for a long time, but they are my family and I love them. My husband thinks they take advantage of me and treat me like a doormat. He doesn't want my kids to hang out with my parents because he thinks they let the kids go hog wild and are bad examples. I feel like he is driving a wedge between my family and myself. I just don't know what to do. I can't live without him or my family, but I can't keep going on being stuck in the middle."
886,i think tonight is time,I messed up and I hate myself for it I really don't want to go on anymore
887,It's funny....,"Well not really funny, more like really disgusting. I'm talking about life. I am so fed up with this pain I have to deal with day after day, and while I know I am responsible for me, it's other people's words and actions that have caused so many wounds. I truly wish I had the courage to take my life....I have a pair of scissors and I tried to cut just now and I used to cut often, but I lost the nerve to do so every since I struck a nerve in a my arm. But the physical pain feels better than the emotional. I want the hurt to stop, but it won't."
888,I cannot stand my toxic family,"Actually, I hate them very much. Sorry for posting again today, but this is too much. One reason why I want to die because I'm around people who are so full of themselves. They're petty, nitpick and find fault even when there is none. If I could leave and get away from them, I would. Really, if I had more courage to kill myself that would be better. But just as I was feeling a little better after another bad day of not being dead, my aunt ruins that with her petty nagging. I would love to stick to these selfish idiots.....I know this may sound bad, and I really don't care, but I hate them all."
889,Trying to Find Something,"I have had a rough go of it lately. In recent weeks, I have contemplated killing myself more and more. I don't want to die, but everything seems so overwhelming, it is hard to take. At my darkest moments (which have been frequent recently), I try to come up with one thing that keeps me from making the ultimate choice. I say, thank God for the baseball season and the New York Yankees. If it wasn't for my love of baseball and my favorite team, I don't know what I'd do or how I'd react. I want to try and stick around to see them win. I know this sounds stupid, but if I can inspire anyone who reads this to find that one thing (anything, no matter how simple it may be) to keep them around today, tomorrow and hopefully a full lifetime, I would be happy. I know how hard it is for all of you struggling. However, please try and find that one thing that brings some joy to you and latch on to it. I know I have and hope all you can as well. Peace."
890,To Everyone in the Suicide forum. Please read below,Do yall think that suicide is the way out of the problem that were all are having ?
891,I just need someone to reply...,I have done so much personal growth...but it only seems to drive people away from me.
892,The advice people give us are all LIES!,"I've been reading through some of these posts, I posted in this forum myself a month or two ago. I have realized something. When people give us advice, it isn't true...just because somebody says everything is gonna be ok, doesn't mean it is. They can't tell the future, how do they know things will get better for us? They also tell those of us who are unlucky in love, ""You will find someone someday!"" well you know what, i'm almost 40 and I've been told that since I was in high school! It's getting ridiculous now to hear that time and time again. I can't have kids much longer, when is my someday going to come?"
893,Can anyone relate?,I joined this site as a sort of last hope that someone could relate to the way I feel.
894,i give up,This has gone from bad to worst come to find out she did have a miscarrige and now there's a chance she could be pregnant again she doesn't even want it that's the last bit of positive I have and the women that would carry it doesny even want it my job is crashing I have no were to live and to know a women that was told she might never be able to have kids can lose one and still not want it with me we don't have to be together but come on I can deal I wanna die I.swear
895,I've Had A Front Seat To Suicide,"Okay, I can appreciate the trenches that folks are in when contemplating suicide but I've had a front seat to suicide twice so in a way, I have direct experience to share. Hopefully, this will be of use to some of you."
896,it finally hit me tonight...,"...like a ton of bricks. I am alone, and I always will be. Maybe this is just another of my many unanswered cries for help. I've spent almost the past year in therapy for depression and anxiety, and I guess it's not working. I thought the meds would help, but no. I thought now that the weather is getting nicer, it would help, but that's only temporary. I try to be positive and likable at work, but I guess it's not helping. I still have no friends, and haven't for years. I'm just tired, tired of being alone, tired of not being normal or even knowing what normal feels like. Tired of seeing everyone else live perfect lives, while I walk alone through life. Tired of being ugly inside and out. I'm done."
897,Failure,"I have been thinking of the way to kill myself for a few weeks now. There is driving my car into the river, jumping off the building, shooting myself with my ex-boyfriends gun, popping a ton of pills, or just start slicing. I don't know how to handle this anymore. My job means a lot to me but I can't help them. I don't even want to be here."
898,I want to die.,"I'm contemplating suicide. Have been for a while. The only thing that's stopping me is I don't want to hurt my ex, but now the pain I am living with is starting to outweigh my fear of hurting him. This scares me."
899,its my fault,i lost her from being dumb and now i hate myself i dont want to be here and now im confused she says she loves me and im her everything but she cant be with me right now i put my hands on her i cant even look at myself in the mirrior im a bad person and i think the world would be better without me i serch my whole life for love i find it and throw it away i just want to end it
900,For those of you who can't get out of depression,
901,Tempted to commit suicide,So basically I've been suicidal since I was 11 I'm currently 16 and have everything planned on how and when I'm going to do it. I want to get help but it's impossible to do without telling my parents. They would say that I am faking it. I suffer from social anxiety so that makes everything worse since I have no friends that could help. I feel like things aren't going anywhere and have given up on trying to behave like a normal person. I can't remember the last time I didn't wish that I wouldn't wake up when I fall asleep at night. I also have depression that has been getting worse to the point where it's hard to smile anymore. Not sure how I would go about getting help or even if its worth trying.
902,This summer just feels like the right time.,"I know that I'm depressed, and have been for quite a long time. But I also know it's not getting better. Suicide has been in my thoughts since I was in high school. It's a thought I've never been able to get rid of. The thought of death is calming, and at least knowing I've have the option of suicide has been relaxing in a way."
903,Of forfeit life and nightmare unending.,"It should be stated first before even starting to parse into thoughts outside of what is considered typical for you humans, that is it no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society."
904,why should i live.,"i'm only 14 yet im a burden on my mother, i got beat by my father, i havn't spoke to my brother in a year and we hate each other.. i used to get bullied and still do, i have tried to kill myself but i can't do it.. i really want to but i can't.. it's come to this though, my dad left a gun in my loft and it's quick and easy to do, the attempts i tried to do was by hanging myself but i can't do it.. i can't go through to pain, i just want it quick and simple unless somebody will convince me not to, i want a reason why should i live, i've never had a girlfriend, i'm fat , hardly any friends , * * * * in school and tons of people hate me, i just can't deal with this anymore somebody please help me.."
906,I hope someone can suggest another option,I'm finding it increasingly difficult to continue living my life with the absence of hope.
907,Need to get thoughts out,"I'm male, single, 30 years old. As far back as I can remember I've had this feeling I was going to die young, and most of that time I thought at some point it'd be me doing it to myself. So now I'm 30, have a good job, have 2 dogs that for the past 2 years have kept me from getting worse after my ex of 8 years left me. Suicide has always been there and big events make it worse. I got through 2yrs ago because of my dogs. But now I feel that's not enough. I've asked my ex to take the dogs this summer. Its almost like I want things to be all taken care of if I decide to ever call it quits. I don't have much, no kids, I'm only close with my dad and that bothers me the most how he'd be affected. Cause I knowledge he'd be devastated. My mom and my sister I really don't care howd they be affected. I just don't see the point to this anymore. I go through the motions of life and really just want it all to be over. I don't if I'd ever be able to go through with suicide, but the thought of it seems to give me some kind of relief. I have been to therapy, but it only gives me a short term feeling of relief, like a day at most."
908,extremely discouraged and thinking of ending my it,"Hi,"
909,What If I Really Am Useless?,"I've been unpopular all my life. And I don't just mean ""the popular kids picked on me""... I mean people I called friends picked on me. Even my very best friends could barely stand me."
910,Suicidal guy who doesn't want to kill himself...,I’ve heard somewhere that suicidal people who “don’t say anything” are much more likely to kill themselves than the people who actually do talk about it.
911,i looked at methods today,as sad as it sounds i was hoping the world was going to end today (im sure you guys heard about it) i was sad when it didnt and even know she is saying positive things its only making me more confused i looked at methods today if i do it i will use my shotgun
912,1 battle at a time,im still fighting with the want to end it but i will give you guys advice
913,It's a little late..,"It's a little late, and I'm posting for moral support once again because I feel as if I'm left with no other option."
914,No chance,"No control over my own mind, my own faculties. Suicide is the narcisstic, wuss' way out. But I sincerely want to end it. Only escape from my mind, which decided today it did not want to share my appreciation of life, just reminded me that it cannot will not cooperate today is the last."
915,I feel trapped and don't know what to do,I feel like I'm the only person in the world with this problem and it's killing me. I am a closeted bisexual 22 year old guy. Only my girlfriend and best guy friend knows about this. Both of them are straight.
916,Why do I feel like this?,"I feel angry, frustrated, annoyed, unfulfilled, delusional, insane, alone, depressed, sad, stupid, worthless.."
917,Sorry but it's all too much,"I thought I had gotten through most of this pain in my life at one point, but I was wrong. Everyday I wake up wanting to die. I have a toxic family, I'm unsure if I will be going back to school in the fall, and I can't get past a broken heart, just to name a few. I know there are other people on here that are hurting, and I am very sorry, especially since I'm adding my own pain to this forum. But it hurts too much to live. Sorry if this didn't make sense, I'm really upset right now."
918,no hope...,"This constant isolation. This constant battle for reputation and purpose in modern-day society. This constant feeling of watching and not participating, it's like time is non-existant for me; the days, weeks, and the years just blend into the next to formulate a never ending sequence of blackness and hatred. I have slowly deleted everyone from my life, the hopes and aspirations i once had as a kid whilst under the influence of sheer delusion have wilted away infront of me as i grew older. I start everyday with my vision distorted by this general feeling of meaningless and insignificance in all aspects of everyday life. People make me physically sick and weak in the stomach,all everyone wants is what they can get from you or you can do for them. i have an ongoing resentment of the human race in it's entirty because of greed and selfishness,everyone is soo fake. I am unable to socialise and to form bonds with others, i doubt if theres is a bright future for an almost blind(lost most sight to glaucoma) constant * * * * -up who can barely(severe stutter) speak in this world,22 and lifes just unbearable and the future looks bleak . I wonder why i even bother to continue. * * * * it, * * * * everything."
919,Since I was 10... I have wanted to die,Hello all.... Since i was 10 years old I have wanted to die. So many things have happened to me. I could say that I have a beautiful family. A wife so beautiful that even angels comment. I have 3 beautiful boys and 1 amazing little girl. They make me so happy but this feeling of wanting to die never leaves. Just the other I took an extension cord and tied it up to a ceiling board downstairs. I stood there for several minutes wanting to tie myself up.
920,How far does the rabbit hole go?,"I sit here, depressed. Depressed as I've been. I've always known this place and am familiar with it. it doesn't make it any easier. My heartaches and sorrow seem a part of my identity. I know pain is temporary and is supposed to fade, but it's all i know. it seems that for this pain to go away, death feels the most logical choice."
921,numb,i just wished i could die right now but i am a coward
922,Lost hope,Ive lost all hope. I don't know who to tell so I'm posting it here
923,the demons are winning,"I honestly don't think I was ever supposed to be here. I don't fit in, maybe because I was never supposed to exist. In the wild only the strongest survive... I've never been strong. My life is so ridiculous it's almost funny. Shame no one will really remember me."
924,How do people prepare for suicide?,"I still don't know how to do it, i have a lot of ideas in my head but don't know how to do it. I wanted to donate my organs after an overdose of pills but i was told they end up useless after dead. Also, i don't wanna suffer and believe the pills are the best option, but will any kind of pills will work? my aunt only has for blood pressure and for maybe diabetics i believe. Has somebody in here ever tried it before? i dont wanna try it and end up still alive at the hospital and be seen as a mentally ill person, knowing how my mother is she will try to lock me up in some kind of hospital"
925,A Final Realisation,"Hello,"
926,nothing else left,"ive been self harming daily, and my anti depressants just dont seem to be working anymore. After finding out that i have nerve damage in my arm from self harm, my mum insisted on having me hospitalised for a short period of time so i can 'fix whatever screwed up things are happening in my head'. I cant stop thinking about different ways to kill myself so i can stop being such a burden on my family and friends, and im scared that one day i will snap and go through with it.."
927,The break up was the last string.,"So after a 2 1/2 year relationship with a girl who i was going to marry, things came to and end. She doesn't see a future together anymore. This is the last string i can deal with, i have nothing else left that makes me happy during the day. My furture goals are no where in sight, i hate the place ive been stuck in for the past 4-5 years. And i have thought about just ending it now. I am a firearms owner so the way is very easy. Whats sacres me is i wont give my firearms up to family to keep them away from me. So i know im not just feeling sorry for myself, and its a thought that might happen. My family doesnt know what im feeling and i wont tell them, i dont want the spot light on me. I'm so torn between this choice. I try to stay strong during my days but it hurts to much and for to long. I'm tired of the little up's and the major down's, im tired of hearing whats meant to be is meant to be, and things will change. It just seems like everyone is talking about the future and that the present just sucks. I just want to relax."
928,I don't know what to do.,My life is getting worse each. My family has fallen apart. My bf of 2 yrs cheated on me 5 months ago..and i just found out. He tells me im perfect and he didnt know why he did it but he can't live without me. I love him and I don't trust him. I feel so alone. I just don't want to live anymore. I try to be decent and in the end everything goes to * * * * . What's the point of living? I don't know what to do.
929,I feell like life has no meaning,"I m tired of life....of my obsession with my ex....of him not loving me the same,but loving me just as a friend with benefits.....of seeing him with his new relationship and telling me he misses my passion ....of telling me we are fantasies....but no future...he said one of us will get tired of this situation one day...."
930,Still not over it after 18 years.,"When I was six years old, my dad killed himself. Everyone tells me I am better off, and I believe them. From what I remember of him, he was always very angry. He never really gave me much attention except to yell at me for something. It was very rare if he ever actually played with me. Whenever I cried about something, if I were hurt or something he would get impatient with me. If he was at home, and I wanted to be with him, he would get impatient with me. I only have a few happy memories of him. Sometimes I kind of wonder if he resented me. Him and my mother only got married because he got her pregnant with me. Plus my mom had my older sister, so he was doing the right thing I guess by giving her a father and staying for my sake. However, from what I've heard he didn't really want kids at that age. He was 21 and my mom was 20."
932,Thinking about it...,"I feel so alone, and each day it seems to get worse. My mom passed away suddenly just a couple months ago, and on top of that my closest friend seems to be pulling away from me. I don't feel like I have anyone to talk to anymore."
933,Breathing Out,"I think about my death all the time now , every day in every way I hate myself,I don't want to be a part of sosiety anymore. I want to be committed. I don't want anyone to feel for me, the only way to get out is to die. I am getting closer everyday . How do I get myself locked up , this is the only way to protect me. I want to leave this planet. I see no future sorry I really am"
934,Evidently not Stanford Material,Just got my rejection letter the other day. The only think I could think to myself as I was opening up the package was the inevitable thought that all of my hard work for the bast four years of rigorous undergraduate hazing (academic not greek) was for nothing.
935,"I feel worthless, mom says I'm better off dead, dad says no one will love me","For the past three years, I have been dealing with on-and-off depression. When it's ""off"" I feel like super woman. However, when it's on, it's crippling. It completely takes over my life and I become completely unmotivated to do anything productive, to see anyone, to to take care of myself, etc. During these periods I feel absolutely worthless, inadequate, and hopeless."
936,planning a will before suicide...,"umm.. so, people that have thought of suicide, have you ever written out a will, living will (in case you fail and end up brain dead/ a vegetable in the hospital you can be sure they pull the plug on you for good and not save you), maybe make burial or cremation plans. Just wondering how you go about the will since I read you need witnesses when you sign it and to make sure someone fills your last wishes.. which you can't really cause then people would suspect you are going to kill yourself and try to stop you... Not that I really have alot, but I would like whatever savings and values I have sold and put towards my pets or if they are no longer around donate anything left to charity or something."
937,"It's on again, like a light switch..","Here I am again, verging on tears and searching suicide methods online. Literally within the past hour, after I had been taking photo after photo of myself and being horrified at what I saw."
938,"I want to kill myself, right now","I want to kill myself very bad. For the whole day it's all I've wanted, my own death. And I want to do it myself. Right now I'm feeling horrid, miserable, and lower than the lowest. I can't stop crying, and recently I asked my step-mom to just hug me because I just feel so sad, I burst into tears about it. I told her earlier how I felt, how I want to die. She didnt know what to say besides, ""I love you,"" and things like that. I have this feeling in my stomach, I want to cut myself, I want to kill myself. I don't know if this is because of my depression, or if it's just intensified because I'm getting off my period. Right now I dont even want to be wrigthing this, I want to be cutting my skin and I want to bleed. I'm having little visions of how I can kill myself, and I looked up on the internet ""the best ways to kill yourself"". I just want my misery over, and to be truthful, I dont know what I'm depressed about even. I just am... I'm so sad. Theres this feeling in my stomach, I want to die, I want to kill myself right now... I'm 13 years old... and I've already had to much of life and my depression to want to live any longer. My friends are frustrated... some of my family are frustrated... But that doesn't really help. I feel so hollow... so ready to die... help? Do I even want help? I don't know, I just know I'm scared of death, but I want to die. :sad:"
939,I want to die.. I think,"I want to die. Nothing in my life makes me happy anymore. The people I love, don't love me back. My family wishes I am someone else then I am. I'm not saying there's nothing in the world that could make me happy, it's just that all the stuff that makes me happy does not happen. I'm not incapable of having fun, but the fun is just temporarily. When I go out with friends I enjoy it even. It's just that I feel like I have nothing to live for. I use drugs, and I enjoy using them. I don't like to work or to study, eventhough I'm not dumb."
940,Help; Don't Know What To Do?,"My parents, they hate me. They let me get connected to something, like swim team, for example. Then they take me out of it, say I get a second chance, then BOOM no going back. When I cry, they only punish me more."
941,Depression,I need help! I am and have been depressed for a long time because I want to be a fictional character from a video game so badly and I have even considered suicide. What do I do!
942,i can't take it,"on the outside, things look great. Working, great relationship with my wife, house, dog, not bad looking, intelligent."
943,Help with talking to suicidal friend?,"A good friend is always trying to convince me why her suicide is a good idea. I have spent about two weeks constantly attempting to talk her out of it, but I'm worried she's not getting better."
944,Haven't been here i awhile...,"Tomorrow it will be two years since I last really contemplated suicide. Sometimes I wish I had the guts to have gone through with it. Things haven't gotten any better, and while I know my family has done much for me in my life, they are one of the biggest problems I have to deal with right now. I tried calling a crisis number a few moments ago, I guess mainly because that's all I have at the moment as far as convenient support, but it felt awkward talking to the other person."
945,Does anyone understand?,"I'm new to this forum, and i found this website through a search engine.. I guess i need someone to talk to. I feel so alone."
946,just so tired...,"ive struggled with depression and self injury for the better part of 6 years... sometimes it gets better for a while, but i always end up back here...and i'm just so exhausted. i know i have people in my life that love me. i know that it would hurt a lot of people if i killed myself. but i also know that people grieve, and move on. i feel like i'm toxic to the people i love, and that i'm always going to be the problem. i have no-one else to blame for feeling like this, just myself. and i'm just so very very tired of trying to make it through this. these last few months have been especially hard with things going on-- bad breakup, death in the family, mom in and out of hospital, etc. i found a guy who is a lot like me and we really hit it off, but in the last two weeks he realized hes going to move accross the country in the fall for school, and so he doesnt want to be close to me either. i can't help but think that i'm never going to find what i want in life, or be able to be happy, because i'm the problem. anyone who sees the real me ends up leaving. i just never feel at peace anymore. i'm always upset. and i'm always overwhelmed, and exhausted. i don't know if i'm going to pass this semester of university, and my parents will be so upset with me for that. but i just can't seem to get anything done, because everything feels like it's going to crush me. i just want to sleep and not wake up. speaking of sleep, i can sleep for 13 hours a night, or sleep through most of the day and night without a problem. i'm just so tired of living... tired of failing, tired of working so hard when nothing pays off...."
947,Why am I even here?,"I just don't know who I am anymore. I've lost any and all control I've ever had of myself. I'm constantly trying to make myself the best possible person I can be, both mentally and physically, but am failing drastically. I feel like a total let down to everyone I know. I'm starting to think that even my own boyfriend, the only person that's ever shown any sign of interest in me what so ever, is starting to fall for another girl."
948,Reincarnation?,"Am I the only on being punished for a past life I don't know about? Every problem in my life hasn't been my fault, or perhaps 10% is my fault as I can't be blameless or guiltless. I don't understand why I have been cursed with this painful and ugly body, and I have always tried to be a good person and help others and the environment and animals. Yet, I have this terrible body, and everyone takes advantage of me, or disrespects me, or puts me down in some way. I don't know why no one will love me. My family doesn't, not even my mother. Everyone seems to care about themselves more than they care about anyone else. Why are people so selfish? I hate humanity, including myself. It makes no sense to me. And people always talk about bad karma, but where is the good karma? It doesn't exist."
949,Scared of Everyone,I've never quite felt like this - like ending it. I feel hopeless
950,Getting worse!!!! ---need advice please,"Hey,"
951,"I have Tried, and i have tried and tried","I have tried so hard, im 31 now, i have had a life of sucesses, but mostly failiures. It all started when i was young, my parents split up in front of me, and i ended up in therapy, i was 7. My dad is cool, but judmental, my mum is angry all the time, even after 20 years i still cant get it right."
952,I don't know what to do anymore,"Well I don't know where to start since this is my very first time going online to get help.. I guess I should start by saying that I have suffered from depression and social anxiety for as long as I can remember. Both have gotten significantly worse during these past few years. At first, I didn't know who to go to so I spoke to my bestfriend and told her exactly how I felt. She was really a great person. If it wasn't for her, I think I wouldn't be here right now. She was very helpful. But several months later, she made new friends and completely pushed me out of her life.. I was so hurt because she was the first person who I had ever been able to trust so much. Once again I was left alone. I have made many other friendships but I keep to myself now. Soon after I felt like I was digging myself into an even deeper hole. I started using drugs(meth, ecstasy,and several other junk) as a way to feel ""better"" but of course I only made things worse. A couplemonths ago I stopped using drugs. I went to a therapist. I lied to her about my drug use. And many other things as well. I find it hard to be able to pour out your feelings and pretty much anything to a complete stranger. She said she couldn't help me because I wasnt really cooperating. Although she was able to figure out that I was depressed and had SA. I honestly feel like there's no one to help me. I feel so alone. I'm always constantly thinking about committing suicide (by the way, I used to self harm as well. Now I have a bunch of nasty burnt scars on my arms) the only way to escape those thoughts is by sleeping. But that's only a short escape because unfortunately, I always wake up and feel just as I had before. I've been thinking about hurting myself again. But most of all, I just don't wanna be alive anymore."
953,I fail,I cant take this anymore.
954,I have tried to be as descriptive as possible so it's quite long. Please help me,"I'm eighteen years old and my ethnicity is Korean. My parents got divorced when I was around four years old. When i was younger, I had severe eczema (a non-contagious skin disease). It was so severe that my lips were literally covered in dry bloody scabs and every part of my body would fall off like dandruff when i rubbed it. Some kids in elementary school picked on me because of that. I had to always cover my mouth with my sleeves whenever in public to @ least hide my lips. I was always alone in school and had some teachers come up to me and tell me to go make some friends. I was always self-conscious and had social anxiety. I would even be afraid and nervous when the teachers come up to me, thinking that the kids would make fun of me over that fact. I always had so many things going on in my head simultaneously. I was a very quiet kid. Too quiet to the point where I wouldn't say a single word in group activities. In school, I never successfully pulled off an activity which required me to talk in front of the class and even introducing myself to people was something i just couldnt do. i would just sit there and wait until the teacher had realized that I have very severe anxiety and just give up on me and call the next person up. I was very abnormal. I had never seen or even heard a kid like me in all my life. I feel like as though I am not human, but literally a deformed trash."
955,It's like a circle,"Starts with a straight line,"
956,Opening up,"So I'm not sure if this is the best forum topic to write this on but I have thought about ending my life because of it. I just want to know that I'm not alone. When I was 10 years old my brother raped me, I'm just wondering if there is anyone else out there that has something similar to that happen. I'm afraid that I might have ptsd, I have flashbacks all the time. Anyone have any advice on how to deal with this. Or even how to tell my parents that this happened? I'm afraid they won't believe me. I also don't know how to tell them because its easier to hate a stranger, how can they hate their own son?"
957,tired of fighting,"my life is a mess. keep getting downhill. just as i thought it is picking up it goes further down. i am so tired. so tired of fighting. i want to give up. i lost everything. my job, relationships, everything that mean something to me. i am all alone, depress and lonely."
959,"ive never felt this low in my life, all i keep thinkin bout is ending it all","ive never been this depressed in my life, the past week has been hell. im so pissed off all the time and depressed, i have anxiety constantly. i take medicine but it obviously isnt doing anything good for me. i cant deal with this pain any longer. i feel so alone. im losing my mind. im always depressed and that pisses me off even more. im flipping out on people and i dont mean it im jus pissed its so hard not to flip out like that. im just tired of my life, im not living im just existing. i cant take it anymore!!! what did i do to deserve this? im just a piece of shyt, thats why nobody cares. something has to give, im done, i cant live like this anymore. k it"
960,"My friend is going to choose to die, and I don't think I can stop her.","She's in her mid-late teens, her life has been a relatively constant stream of abuse and pain."
961,My friend's boyfriend killed himself after mine died....,She's now with one of his friends. She was with him for 6 years from the age of 16 til 22 and knows nothing else. Everyone can see that they shouldn't be together.
962,I cant take this anymore,"I dont know what to do anymore. I feel so alone cause i dont have anyone to talk to. I want to be dead and gone from all of this. My life is hell everyday, every hour. I cant put up with everything anymore. Im depressed and stressed out. My mom and her boyfriend have been fighting for 2 days straight, to the point where i thought someone would call the cops. I cant take the yelling anymore. They finally stopped and now i have the worst headache in the world. I already have myself to worry about and all my problems, then i gotta deal with their drama. Nothing will ever get better, it just keeps getting worse and worse. unfortunately i have no where else to live right now, so im stuck with all of this, i cant do it anymore im tired. I have so much stress it feels like a thousand pounds on my shoulders. I cant live like this, im so alone. Nobody cares, i know everybody says that but there is nobody that cares how i feel. I have a whole bottle of pills that knock you out like sleeping pills, i think bout just swallowing them all and just falling asleep and never wake up. Nobody understands what im going through right now. Im suffering and it hurts, and i feel stupid admitting that. I give up, the pain is too much for me to take anymore.. If you knew how i feel inside then you would understand why i want to be dead. No one should have to feel this bad. God must really hate me."
963,So I was thinking........................,"This is the perfect time to die. I don't see any point in living. I never asked to be here and f**** hate being alive. Everything and everybody is a major disappointment...... I know life is unfair but my life is f****** ridiculous. There is no 'good advice"" or advice that is going to make me change my mind so don't waste your time with that cheesy bs."
965,Why I want to kill myself,"I am almost 17 years old. I'm from Eastern Europe. I am an orphan and up to 14 years I lived in an orphanage. Then a family came and adopted me. I thought I was lucky and I'll finally be happy. My new parents took me to England. Here my father raped me several times and then sold me to a pimp. For over two years I've been forced to prostitute myself, beaten, tortured ... A year ago I tried to kill myself . I failed and because I tried to kill myself the pimp have put me into a cage where I spent a week only with water. A month ago I managed to run away to escape. Now I'm in another city and hide in an abandoned house. I met an old woman that I help with little things and she let me on the computer. She does not know my history. I believed that everything will be fine. But every night I have nightmares, I'm afraid of any man who looks at me in the street. I can not resist anymore. I think I go crazy. I don't have a friend or a person to tell my problems and my fears. I think that the only solution is to try again and to succeed this time."
966,What am I thinking?,Here lately i've just wanted to end everthing. It's like nothing even matters anymore. I have no reason at all to stay on this earth. Sometimes I wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up just always feel that comfortable and peaceful. I just want to be numb. I don't want this pain anymore.
967,Sold stuff bought ticket in puerto rico,Well the countdown has begun. Should I stay in pr or should I do it In the states?
968,Thank you ((((hugs))))),"Hello everyone,"
969,"suicide is my only option, trust me","Ive had plenty of time to think about this and i feel low enough to the point where i want to take my life, and end this. Its never going to get better. Im already going to counseling and taking medicine, and it does nothing. Theres no light anymore, i have no hope. Everything is negative in my life. I dont wanna be around anyone anymore cuz its all just all lie. Im just putting on a front whenever im with anybody, they dont care how i feel so theres no point in showing anything and just act normal. Im tired of being lonely and empty, i feel like i dont even belong on this earth. Im tired of feeling anything anymore. i cant take this pain and suffering everyday, i have nothing left, no will to even try and keep on going and hope things get better. Im not meant to be here, i dont belong anywhere. I have to do this, i just feel like its what i have to do. I dont want this life i cant do it. Everyday i think about ending it all. My life is so messed up, my life is all bad since i was a baby. The damage has already been done, theres nothing anyone can do to change the things that ive been seen or been through. I dont have anyone to be there when i need them. I dont have any trust or faith in anyone anymore, all i have is myself. Thats why i need this to stop, i cant live any longer feeling like this."
970,The positives of my suicide,I am going to die.
971,Im a Ginger and want to kill myself.,"Im sick of all the hate I get anywhere I go. All the friends I have eventually left me, and ive had multiple people tell me that Im an attractive guy aside from my hair color. I have no freckles, but I get made fun of just as bad. I happen to drive a red car and that makes it no better. Ive went on one date with one girl, and I think she did because she felt bad for me. Ive been hated and teased all my life."
972,Emotional blackmail?,"About 15 years ago my younger cousin would threaten to kill herself whenever her boyfriend who was her high school sweetheart tried to break up with her. They have been married now for a while and have two young kids. Her sister, another cousin of mine, also threatens to commit suicide if her family doesn't financially support her while she pursues her dream of becoming an actress in LA. She now has a child who she is grooming for show business. My theory is that my cousins threaten to commit suicide because they are spoiled brats, endulged, and throw tantrums when they don't get their way. I even think they may have personality disorders. I don't believe they would ever take their own lives. However I would like to see my family call their bluff and institutionalize them fir a couple if days with their next suicide threat. People in my family are actually afraid of them. They believe these women have strong personalities and that's why they get their way. Now they have kids of their own and their children throw temper tantrums beyond what would be normal, screaming, kicking, throwing stuff."
973,a little hope but i just dont know if its enough,"Where do i start, hmm gee i guess here:"
974,self harm,"Ii realized near the end that there was nobody that gives a crap. I never left a note. Thought about it, realize if end it, what good will note serve. Biding time now. P.S life sucks. Mind anyway. Luck for those suffering."
975,Is this enough?,"I've been thinking about death a lot lately. I'm not really depressed or sad or anything, I just don't see any point in life. I don't believe in a god, an afterlife, or anything like that. It all just seems so meaningless. What difference does it make if I die today, or 60 years from now? I'll still be dead, and those 60 years won't have affected anything. I just don't feel like putting up with another 60 years of bull * * * * . I have 100 tablets of tylenol/acetaminophen (500mg each, 50,000mg total), an 8oz bottle of robitussin DM/dextromethorphan, and 60 caplets of aleve/NSAID (220mg each, 13,200mg total). If I were to take all of that, and then drink a few beers and some vodka, would that be enough to kill me, or would I just pass out and wake up in a hospital screaming in pain?"
976,I need some new advice,"Hello all,"
977,2011 will be my last year of torment.,"I think I'm done. Can't cope with life for much longer. All these up and downs, feeling confident one minute, like dirt the next.. I've just had enough, I simply hate everything about myself and that's never going to change. I'm constantly being faced with people so much more fortunate than me and I can't * * * * ing take it! I've had to listen to my cousins boyfriend go on about how he was featured in a teenage girls magazine and just hearing that * * * * ing made me feel like jumping out the nearest window. I am not who I want to be physically, and there is nothing in this world I can do to change that so what other option is there really? Nothing that's what. My hatred of myself has prevented me from even pursuing a normal life. I opted out of moving abroad for college cause of it, I don't socialize due to it, I just don't have anything close to a normal life. I'd much rather end it, and leave with some dignity. So * * * * it, final year of my life approaching. Cheers and * * * * you miserable piece of * * * * of a body."
979,need someone to talk to- hours from suicide,I have decided to kill myself tonight. But there is still something inside me that needs to ask for help and get out and I have run out of options of people to talk to and confide in. If anyone is available to talk could they pm me or let me know. I am feeling pretty scared at the moment and im not sure where to turn.
980,how do i know.,"i visite this site often , it makes me feel less alone. also id like to post my own story.. but i am scared.. how do i know it wont be traced back to me , by using my ip adress? i dont want anyone else knowing in my region about how i think ."
981,I can't find any energy.,"I can't find any energy to ever want to do anything. If I could, I would just sleep all day every day. I'm really unhappy."
982,All Alone,My days are getting slimmer with no hope i tried to go to work at 2:30 am and i just couldn't do having panic attacks and crying almost for 3 hours! I have no one to turn to and not a feeling inside! It killing me i can't pick up the phone and call my ex! its been really hard not being able to talk too her last time was Friday but i didn't text her at all Sat or Sun!

I love her with all my heart but hatred is setting in for her after her leaving me when i needed her the most! My depression is why she left and she says she exhausted but why do people leave when they know you need them! I stopped talking to friends cause most them in alcohol and drugs and she was my best friend my girlfriend my happiness!I feel like my soul is gone and it just my body present! I keep staring at my mothers pills or the balcony outside to hang myself! I am dead already wish it was real
983,Can't think straight,My depression is getting worse after my girlfriend broke up with me little over a month.She left me cause she said she is exhausted and i neglected her needs but she still says she loves me but now she is dating someone new!She had her own issues and i supported her through her tough time and was there for her until my world was crashing down on me and i was overwhelmed with everything in my life and depression hit me! I never meant to neglect her i didn't even realize i was doing it! It is taking a lot outta me that she left me cause i wasn't getting better!I supported her and when she got strong she left and couldn't be there for me! I can't do this anymore all i wanna do is go away and not live another day! Its not all just cause her its everything in my life! i just have no more strength or will to live! I needed her and she left when i needed her the most! I think daily about killing myself and i have gone to therapy in the past and it seems to never work! My life i feel is done and nothing better or good will come
985,Religion + Homosexuals,"I'm a seventh day adventist. While I do not attend church, I do believe. My Bible teacher said that homosexuals are allowed in heaven only if they do not engage in homosexual acts."
986,This isn't going to be any different to any other post at all...,"Ok... I just joined, because I'm feeling not so good."
987,Exit stage left...,"I won't go into much detail but if you want the details I have another post. Basically my ex left me after four years. Now she parades around like we never happened.. I gave my heart to her and she stabbed it.. She ended it claiming she was the problem and that she wanted to soul search as a single and would talk to me when she calmed down, and now.. it more like its just to go off and becoming a * * * * . Its just not her, I feel now like I have never known her. What ever she was to me and what ever love I felt for her is dead, shes dead to me and I am dead as well. I found out she was a smoker... what the hell? I hate smoking and after four years she could never tell me!? Makes me wonder if that disgusting piece of meat was also cheating on me behind my back.(probably.) On the surface she was awesome to me and supportive but now I see her as an impostor she used me... Its like shes saying, ""Yes lets use the guy who was dieing of cancer to further my own personal gains yippee"". WHAT A MONSTER, How can she have become this evil.."
988,What is the point?,"It's got to a point where I just don't see the point to myself. I can't stay in a relationship for more than two months, I always muck relationships up. I can't sleep anymore because I'm constantly having nightmares so I look a mess the whole time. My work is failing because I don't understand anything and I'm so tired all the time. My body is completely wrecked because I'm constantly eating and I've lost count of how many scars and bruises I have. So I can't attract the people I want. I've spent 5 years of my life under the thumb of a girl who mucked me about and never knew what she wanted and I have to see her 5 days a week and I hate it. The guy I want to be with I can't be with, and my childhood is so mucked up I can't understand it. My friends are getting fed up of my constant moodiness and the fact that I always need them there for me because I'm pathetic when it comes to looking after myself because I always end up doing the wrong thing. I don't see the point in my life because it's not going to go anywhere. I'm losing the ability to see a future."
989,just about there,does anyone know of any suicide prevention chat rooms or websites with live help for people wanting to commit suicide? i just really need to talk to someone right now.
990,Please help me...,"I'd never really do it because I'd feel too guilty about hurting all the people in my life that I know would be effected for a long time, whether or not they really loved me. My story is posted as ""Sexually abused and want to be normal"" or something along those lines. I can't act on it but don't want to be alive. I need to stop crying all the time. My head aches. I don't expect any sympathy...I just wish I was worth as much to anyone as the people that get nice replies."
992,I hate myself,"When I think of my future I see nothing. Pitch black. I just turned 22 years old and I have posted on this site for 4 years now about the same issues. I hate my life. Everything about it. I am envious of almost every person I meet these days. I am an alcoholic, if I have a sip of alcohol I end up blacking out by the end of the night just to mask this * * * * I feel everyday."
994,I finally have the courge to reach out.. i am here( v long post),I am kind of new here.. well my id is new.. i have been following this forum and i am happy that the advice on others problems by the valuable users also helped me in one way or the other...
995,I think I've reached my breaking point,"In the last 2 years I've suffered a serious injury, legal problems, financial issues, being assaulted and injured and I was broken up with 3 times."
996,The black dog is back,The crippling feelings of worthless are back.
997,just a thought,I've often thought about telling everyone I was going to move to another country and I may never see them again. Just so no one would blame my death on themselves.
998,I just want to take this gun and shoot myself tonight...,"I don't know why but I went out with a man last night and I'm not sure if we had sex. I feel like a * * * * . We drinked a little too much and I'm not sure what happened. He texted me and said that we did nothing more than kiss, I woke up in his bed but although I was fully clothed, my vagina feels sore. I think I might of fell too, because I have bruises on my legs and my breast has finger prints. I feel like dying tonight."
999,Suicide now?!?,"Well it's nit that I'm depressed because there's nothing wrong with my life I have a loving father and mother a great sister but I'm bored. There is nothing to do I don't like this way. I want to see what happens I want to know about other things Im just curious I have been bullied but that's a long time ago I have looked into ""life"" and figured out everything I don't think like others I can see things others can't. I need some answers soon like NOW....before I jump"
1000,Sad me.,"I am lonely. I am so, so lonely. I think everyone in the apartment is suffering from it."
1001,I need to be dead more than anything - but guilt is keeping me trapped...as ever,"I hate my life. I hate myself. I hate my family. I hate humanity and all who are part of it. It disgusts me, it disgusts me to BE human, it disgusts and sickens me that I continue to exist."
1003,not sure why im here,"u have never done anything like this before, usally i suffer in silence cant be bothered to talk to people and the only person i learnt to trust let me down. from a personal point of view like so many people here before me i want to die cant be bothered with all the polotics think i have decided on how think my next thing is letters."
1004,exbf put gun in his mouth over the phone last night.,"Last night was horrible. It was probably the worst night of my life, and I've had some bad ones. I've had a lot of terrible things happen to me, but I can't even imagine behaving the way my ex did."
1005,I'm going to kill myself this weekend,"If my best friend doesn't see me. This will have been the fourth time she's not followed through with plans because of her own little world, and I've just been so depressed lately that I need a friend, or just someone, who I know IRL to actually act like they give a crap about me. She never knows what to say anymore...yet I'm the one who knows just what to say to her when she's contemplating suicide."
1006,Pathetic,"I feel so alone in this wretched world. Actually, i am alone in it. I have no one. I look in the mirror and all i see is this pathetic little idiot cursed with breath. I just wanna die and leave it all behind."
1007,So sick of everything,Nothing in my life ever turns out right. It's just one bad thing after another. It's led me to not want to do anything.
1008,I have nobody,please talk to me
1009,My cousin committed suicide but has been revived,This happened a few hours ago my grandmother found him hanging from the closet. He was purple. My cousin Alex began Cpr while my grandmother called 911. There was no response as my cousin was dead. The ambulance were able to revive him. I'm still waiting on the news as to where the hospital is and what his current status is. I know that if you hang yourself there is a great possibility that you will have brain damage. I'm assuming the belt or rope whatever used didn't snap his neck because it was done in a closet. Does anyone know the time you have before you actually get brain damage? Hopefully he doesn't end up paralysed or a vegetable. All my grandma cares about is his needs and him all about him. If he doesn't pull through she's going to croak. She literally will have nothing to live for because that's what is keeping her going as of now. Does anyone know the time frame? I'm assuming he was dead for more than 5 minutes is there brain damage?
1010,"I Can't Take this anymore, I Feel like im going crazy","Just to get to the point,i feel like im going crazy and i don't know what to do.I walk in the mall,i walk in a school,i walk anywhere i feel like everyone is looking at me,i think everyone hates me,some people even do look at me from head to toe and give me this weird look.Sometimes i can't even look at people in the eye out of fear, i wish i was tougher but im not, i feel weak inside,i feel worthless my inferiority complex is getting the best of me these days.Had a girlfriend and i couldnt get it up, so she dumped me because of that, i know im not making any sense but my mind is everywhere right now,inside im hurting this pain i just want to let it out into a violent outcry maybe not by word maybe by violent actions, yet i do not want it to be that way.I don't want to hurt myself, feel like demons in my face all the time maybe not directly but through people, because it does seem everyone is against me, even my brother today told me i need help because he thinks im schizophrenic however you spell it.Sometimes i do want to leave this painful world behind,but i do want to experience what it is to be free, free on the wings of destiny, of purpose,of worth yet im stuck in a dark tunnel not knowing where to turn just hoping on the other side i will see a light i can runto, corny as it is that's how i feel:sad:"
1011,I just want to end this life of mine..i cant do this anymore:(,"Im 24 years old will be 25 this year... I feel sad, alone and wish I was never born. Today my dad said im a failure i let him down and im the eldest and he feels ashamed when other people ask him what are your kids doing and he says nothing. Actually im working for him, i failed school...never got into college..have no qualifications. Ive done the odd computer course and office admin course but struggle to find a job so im working for my dad. I am so depressed...everyday is a struggle for me...i feel like a shattered glass and each morning i have to pick up the pieces before i can get myself together and go to work. I am grateful for my dad giving me a job ,its just that i let my parents down..i feel like a failure and im too ashamed to tell anybody i failed school. The real reason i failed was coz i was more interested in a stupid guy who i let influence me into bunking school and i never really study for my examz and he didnt care if i passed.. im not with him anymore though.."
1012,I feel like I cant fix me anymore and I suicide is all thats on my mind,So at this point I have chalked up the disorder and came to my senses that I am just way too depressed for anything.
1013,Ending it All,"It's past the point of trying to feel better. I'm tired of everyone telling me i'll feel better etc. Well they don't know what it feels like to be in my shoes. I would have a few days I'd be ok, but not anymore. I hide in my room when I'm at home, and I hate talking to my parents when they come in my room to talk to me. I'm so shady towards them. I'm losing the relationship I had with my parents. I don't want to see them, or anybody else."
1014,cut or fatel wound,I dont want to be alive. I bought a surgery scaple off a medical site to slit my wrist or fately stab myself.
1015,Too worthless to read,Please don't waste your time Reading this. I'm only writing it because I'm an attention-seeking cow who is so self-centred she doesn't realise how hard others lives are compared with hers.
1016,Just tired...,Thinking about dropping out of school again. Haven't been back for two full semesters yet and I'm already tired of all these f-ing people. Tired of being so lonely all the time; constantly dwelling on how and why I've never had a girlfriend.
1017,Am I crazy? Is this Post Traumatic Stress Disorder?,"I'm going to skip some details, but my Dad used to be"
1018,"Well, hello there Mr. Bottle of pills...","So I guess I can vent here. Nothing will be solved by doing this, but hey."
1019,Is there any point to my life? Is there any real reason for me to keep living?,"I'm a 24-year-old guy who has been clinically depressed since adolescence. That would probably come as a surprise to the people around me. I've never really felt like doing much of anything. I always did well in school and have always been able to make people laugh but it's like, to use Eminem's words, ""this f*ckin black cloud still follows me around."" A while ago, a girl I was in love with in high school told me on facebook that she ""still"" loved me. That was news to me since I never knew she had feelings for me in the first place. You know what I felt when I read that message from her? Not much. She put herself out there, thinking she's reaching out to someone normal but instead she's reaching out to me, the headcase she had the misfortune of meeting many years ago. I have feelings for her and I think about her all the time."
1020,"If You've Ever Considered Suicide, Please Read",I'm not usually the best person to come to for advice. I have trouble dealing with my own problems to focus on the needs of other people. It's hard for me to reach out to others. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to tell them.
1021,Starting to debate with myself if it's worth it...,"I keep going through bouts of suicidal thoughts and depression, and until now, it seemed to be getting better. Then I found out I missed two finals because I got the dates wrong..my GPA is barely hanging on to a 2.0 as it is. I've fallen into a really bad slump again....I feel like I'll never be good enough and that I should just end this failure of a life. Maybe it's a stupid reason to get like this..but this is how I'm feeling...what should I do?"
1022,I dont see the point,"I thought my feelings of suicide were gone but I guess not. Im sick of being unemployed, broke, and unhappy all the time. I cant even afford a $1 holiday card to give as a gift. I rely on family to get by. Bills are piling up and I dont know where to turn. Sure I've had a few jobs in the last few months. I'd sit through all the training and then just up and leave within a week. I don't know why I do this to myself. I just walked out on my 4th job in 5 months last night. What the hell is wrong with me? Why must I feel like a prisoner of my on mind? Why can't I control my thoughts? I just want to be happy like everyone else I see around me. Sometimes I cry for no apparent reason. I dont enjoy the things I used to like playing my guitar or listening to music. If we are all going to die anyway why should I wait in this prison?"
1023,I really messed up..,So I have been caught smoking weed again by my mom. My two older brothers are heroine addicts ad they started out smoking weed. My mom thinks I'm going to be just like them. I care about my mom and I can't stop smoking. I am 16 and I'm considering running away or hanging myself.. I don't really see a reason to be around when all I do is hurt the people around me. Anyone have any suggestions on what I should do?
1024,Last night's text,Originally posted in the wrong place...
1025,convinced that I'm done here.,"Hey all. never thought I would truly consider this in my life but here I am. I don't even know why I'm posting, I cant figure out what I want from other people."
1026,Feels Right,"Hey Everyone,"
1027,Death is the only option,"I am 19 years old. I have researched suicide topics before and I always hear stuff like suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem or that I have so much to live for ETC. When it comes to me these people are wrong. I have thought about suicide since I was 11 years old and literally every day since starting high school at the age of 14. How is that temporary? I have thought about suicide for nearly half my life and there is no end in sight. I picture myself hung up in the garage, belt around my neck all the time. I imagine if I was able to find a gun I would have been dead a long time ago because I am to scared of getting hurt or someone finding me before I die if I try to hang myself. As for the second thing of having something to live for, I really don't. Some people will be like oh you are exaggerating but I am not just gonna make * * * * up. I constantly make lists of why I should kill myself and they are like three pages long. First of all I have never had friends. At the moment right now I have one friend. Yes, one friend who I hang out with occasionally and two other guys I text but hang out with like twice a year. My parents tell me that I just got to try talking to people more but I literally can't because I have nothing to say and when it comes to girls my voice gets shaky and I end up looking at my feet. I have never kissed a girl let alone having a girlfriend. My favorite things to do in the world is play sports. I played hockey and I was the worst player on my team in the worst division. I played baseball and I quit after grade six because I got one hit all year (dead serious) and never got to pitch because I couldn't throw hard enough. I am a ginger (don't even act like it doesn't matter, 99% of girls find that very unattractive), I have acne all over my body, I am obese and tried to lose weight by changing my eating habits and working out, didn't work and now I can't afford a gym membership. I took a year off after highschool and worked at * * * * ing walmart for the year as a cart pusher even though it was only part time because I was to scared to get a real/new job because of my fear of new people and learning new things. I currently go to university, but its off campus for the morons who didn't meet the requirement of 70 %(Thats how dumb I am) to get into the actual university. I am currently getting 60's while only taking three easy classes, it is clear that I am not going to make it after this year and I have wasted my parents money. I cannot go into a trade because I am very afraid of screwing up and showing my idiocy to people. I can barely do simple tasks. The only things that used to make me happy were watching/following all major sports and listening to music, those things don't even make me happy anymore. I take no interest in watching hockey/baseball/football, which I used to do all the time and I don't even dl music anymore, I used to have 2000 songs. Sometimes I just sit in this chair with my computer on staring at the google homepage for hours. To top it all off, I am the black sheep of my entire family. My one younger brother (grade twelve) has a girlfriend, is skinny, brown hair one of the most popular kids at his school, great at sports and plans to be an electrician right after he graduates. My other younger brother (grade ten) is also skinny, TONS of friends, blonde hair, and gets 90's. I have eleven cousins and all of them have tons of friends, are all skinny, good at everything they do. My seven older cousins all have great jobs (two engineers, two mechanics, teacher, speech therapist, Business), they all have clear faces, NO red hair and funny enough they are all in relationships longer then a year, the majority live with their boy/girlfriends. I also wake up every day feeling like * * * * and with a big headache. I got glasses after complaining of headaches because my right eye is weak and I was apparently straining it, the glasses helped for about three weeks and the headaches reappeared. My body aches constantly and I am always tired no matter how much I sleep. I am never going to be able to make friends, get a girlfriend who genuinely likes me and that I genuinely like, all of a sudden become good at something. I am not even close to my siblings and I see my cousins, aunts and uncles literally three times a year. The only people who will be sad to see me dead are my parents. My siblings/cousins/aunts may care for a little bit and then just forget. Approximately 30 people might show up for my funeral and just my one friend (maybe). People say that suicide is a selfish choice, but the real selfish thing is to expect people to continue living a life they hate every day. I wake up every day thinking ""is this the day I finally kill myself?"" and I go to bed thinking ""Damn do I ever wish I was dead"". I literally thought today was going to be the day I was gonna hang myself. I was gonna get it all set up and was going to call the police seconds before I was going to kick the chair out from under me so they can find me dead instead of my parents. I know this is long and I doubt anyone reads it... it also looks like it was written by someone with the mental capacity of a second grader (not surprising), but my end is near and I am hoping that my lifeless body hangs from the roof of my garage by noon tomorrow. Goodbye world."
1028,"woman I know, told me she tried to commit suicide... please help",I wrote a merry christmas text to all my friends today.
1029,is suicide the only option I have left?,"It's the day after Christmas and I'm feeling pretty down. I just realised how much I dislike my family and spending time with them. They don't get how I'm feeling, and if I told them I'd be out on my ass end of. ](*,)"
1030,I need help..,"Nothing in my life is bad, and I'm not even the type of person who looks like they would be depressed at all... But for me every day i wake up is just another day of hell.. I dont have anything specific to complain about, I'm just not happy.. I have a constant aching feeling in my chest and my stomach from being upset all the time.. I get sad and upset to the point of making myself sick, literally. I just don't see a point to life anymore, all we do is work our whole lives then die in the end. I would have killed myself already, just like my dad did, but i know it would kill my mother.. [no pun intended]. It would devistate her just like it did when my dad killed himself.. But I'm not happy.. And I hate suffering every single day just to make her happy, because every day i wake up and feel a little worse than before."
1031,I should be happy but just can't find peace,"A break up of a relationship of 7 years due to me cheating and then ending it. 4 months of begging to get back together, a move into a spare room at a friend's, then moving home with parents."
1032,What should I do?,Last night my boyfriend and I got in a fight.
1033,What's the point?,My question is: why should i continue to live?
1034,Please Help I Want To Die But Can't Do It Alone,Sice i was about 10 years old i was told i suffer from autism.
1035,anniversaries,"A long time ago, I walked into a WC intending to kill myself. It didn't take, and the recovery in the hospital was agonizing. I was hooked up to six machines (maybe more) and denied access to the bathroom. If I did have to go, it had to be in front of a security guard. A tech came along at some point as well, telling me he was going to catheterize me for a urine sample. I knew it wasn't his idea so I told him to tell the head nurse to go have sex with herself, then I sat up and forced out the amount they'd needed. I'd learned what I was in for if I ever decided to try again. Adding insult to injury, a few people I knew, who hadn't been there, told me they doubted the legitimacy of my suicide attempt."
1036,"Don't want to die, but feel like I need to...","It just seems like I'm out of options. I've tried therapy and meds, getting back into exercising, taking an interest in new things. I've tried to put myself out there in hopes that something might make me feel better, but nothing really does. The anxiety and depression continue to linger over me. Everything about my life sucks, and I feel like I'm stuck. In other posts, I've talked about my job and how I'm not satisfied by it. I wanted to go back to school, but to do that I would have to quit my job. I tried working and going to school the first time around, and it didn't work out for me. Seeking treatment throws another variable into this, because if I quit, I lose my insurance, and won't be able to get treatment. I'll sink deeper into depression, and there won't be any point in anything."
1037,Cant do this anymore...,"please bear with me iv never done this but have no one to turn to, im currently sat listening to some sad songs...basically iv been with my partner for 3 years, they have been rocky as last year i was heavily on drugs and alcohol, i vowed to her to get clean, i havnt had a drink or any drugs since febuary 2010, weve been through so much and last night, she tells me she doesnt think were working out and that she doesnt love me anymore,a week before christmas, after so many talks on how were gonna enjoy christmas this year, now i live with her, and she says i need to move out, a week before xmas...and dont get paid till 23rd...i cant do this anymore, iv had so much bad in my and no good, i know it sounds like im being a big baby, but im so down i really dont see the point, and i work in a call centre, am i sposed to go there and be happy speaking to customers all day? i cant even put a smile on my own face never mind speaking to them...iv lost everything..please help me...i dont know where to turn"
1039,Nobody cares,"I tried. But at this point I'm far too tired. Feel like I'm 80 although I'm a pathetic 30. Really wish I could go back in time and erase me. I don't want to cause pain, but really don't want to live. It all seemed simple, but it's not, not even a little. I loved everyone, but let's face it, they don't. None of them. Good for them. Hate me, it'll do you good later you sick people. It's okay. I gave it all I had. Even if I had the power to change the world, I'm just far too disgusted about how selfish people are to care anymore. Just don't have it in me anymore. I hope you all find the peace and strength that I never could."
1040,good bye,"tomorrow, I will kill myself. Let everyone know that I love my kids forever. I am just to tired to carry on any more"
1041,what now?,"I have a forum on LGBT explaining my situation. Long story short, I fell in love, he found out, and now hates me. I'm not really emo, I've never cut before. At times I'm just fine, but other times, I wana fill the tub with warm water, lay in it, and slit all the way up my arms, feeling sweet release. What could there possibly be to live for? What now?"
1043,donating my organs,"so i've been thinking about suicide a lot (every couple of days/weeks for over a year now, maybe even two years). then i thought to myself if i just die it would be a huge waste. so if i sign an organ donor card, after i die at least i can make a small contribution to the world."
1044,Had enough of living!!! Might trigger !!!,"I am not coping anymore. 6yrs ago I was gang raped by 4 guys and as result I became pregnant and HIV positive. The attack was a very violent one and they were going to throw me into a resevour so I didn't tell any1 but I managed to get away. I was coping but I am now suffering with flashbacks, panic attacks and nightmares, I just want to die I have tried many times in the last 3 wks but unfortunately I am still here. I have recently been diagnosed with ptsd. Feel I cannot go on anymore because the rape was my fault, I went out and got drunk in a short dress and heels so must have been asking for it. Don't know what else to say. :sad: ](*,)"
1045,I lost what I think is the love of my life,"I was with this girl for one year and I loved her very much. It's been 7 months since we last spoke. She has a new boyfriend now and has been with him for 4 months and loves him. I love her still. I miss her, I miss our memories."
1046,Ricinus communis beans or hypothermia or Potassium chloride,"Hello,"
1047,apparently being myself is wrong,Ok I am new here.
1048,Just really lost,"I don't know what's wrong with me. I feel like I have no control over my life right now, I just turned 19 and I realized that I don't have my license, I don't have a job and it seems like everyone is treating me like a child. I can't go anywhere with my friends because I really don't have any, since I graduated from high school I've lost contact with everyone, I'm really too shy to go out and make new ones or I don't even know where to start. I feel like I'm way too weird, that I'm completely different from everyone else and most of the time I can't go anywhere because I hate myself so much. I've lost about thirty pounds in six months and I'm not sleeping because the thoughts of being alone and not having any real plan in my life is killing me. It scares me that I'm thinking of actual plans to off myself, I've never thought like that before and everyday, the feeling seems to get worse and worse."
1049,I feel done with life,"I am only 10 years old to start, and I feel that I am the most piece of crap son there ever was. I just act like I hate my mom, but I know I love her very much on the inside. I feel like the world would just be better without me. At school I am just that other new kid to pick on. I just really need to talk to someone, but I can't call anyone (I don't want my mom finding out) and I don't feel like going to a therapist is the best for me, so I decided to go to the forums, I don't feel totally like I want to commit suicide yet but I have been thinking about it.....haters please listen to this, if you reply to me telling me I am a * * * * * * or to young I need to drop my balls etc. Just know that you pretty much just made a ten year old boy commit suicide...so that will be good for you. Please reply"
1050,My Life is Forfeit,"I've thought of committing suicide for years now. Ever since my first love tarnished my heart back when I had just turned 17. I'd always been more advanced in terms of thinking than my peers for a long time. Most times, this led kids to judge me harshly when I was much younger and to counter this, I was purposefully act like an idiot."
1051,I've decided,Hi
1052,Help me!!,I am sixteen years old and i have struggled with depression since i was 5 and my parents go divorced i have recently lost a good friend and i have not had a girlfriend or my first kiss yet. recently i have considered suicide again and i need help i want to stay but i may go deeper. please help!!!
1053,Beyond the point of no return...,It's a weird feeling knowing that you want to die. Yet most people won't act upon these feelings due to one thing and one thing only - FEAR.
1054,Just Lost Someone,"A man I met 2 years ago that was a huge mentor to me killed himself today. I don't know any details, except that his wife left him yesterday. This guy taught me so much about the career I'm in now, and I had even been thinking about asking him if I could come stay with his family for a few days to help as an apprentice at his studio and learn more from him."
1055,Im so lost,Everyday seems to blur into one. i seem to be doing the same things over and over. trying so hard to impress those who just simply turn away. and when they all turn away i am left to ponder why im still here. i think why am i still here and my answer is i dont know...
1056,I can't think of anything that would make me enjoy life enough to go another decade.,"I always seem to come back here with a bigger problem... I'll admit straight up this is a checklist of reasons for me to stay alive, I'm just going to explain my situation in each category and see what you have to say. Obviously I'm biased toward suicide, but of course most people reading this will be biased against suicide. I apologize I've been up all night and this post may not be edited the best and I may not mean what I've typed as harshly as it sounds. Anyway..."
1057,I'm just tired of living so lonely...it hurts so much.,"I've moved to Minnesota from California 2 years ago, and during that time I had a break up that really messed with my perception of dating and human contact, and I got kicked out of my dad to live with my mother who could care less but was court ordered to take me."
1058,I am out of options,I have been trying so hard for the past month to overcome my ever growing need to die...I have talked with so many people and it just isn't helping...I have received so many negative suggestions and remarks that I really feel like I am suppose to die...I have many ideas on how to do but mostly that's just what they are I suffer from a few different mental health issues and have not gotten any better..now i am without insurance and cant see anybody for them and can receive no medications...I am spinning so out of control that death seems so much better than suffering any longer...I am out of options as to what I can do anymore..seems nobody cares about you they tell you oh it gets better but when in a hundred years?...no it does not get better for me as I have dealt with this since I was in 9th grade so guess what?...I am tired of fighting it...I dont know what to do anymore
1059,"I'm so tired, I don't want to exist.","I'm so tired of everything. Nothing is wrong. There is absolutely nothing wrong, so why am I so tired? Something snapped in me at the beginning of last year. I just... I don't want to be alive. Nothing is wrong, everything is fine. I have friends, I have loving family, school isn't a problem. But why does it feel like so much of a chore... so much of a burden to attend? It was always fine in the past. So why now? I've lost all interest in anything. I feel so alone. I'm doing my best, but it's not enough. I'm trying hard and I'm doing my best, but now I want to sleep. I want to sleep forever."
1062,Inside myself is a dark place where I live all alone ...,Another day is ending here.. Ending the same way as the one before and before.... and before.. Young woman crying herself to sleep.
1063,An Answer Delayed is Not An Answer Denied,Life is meaningful. But only with a meaning. Your life is meant to have meaning.
1064,support groups... another resource you can use!,"Hello everyone,"
1065,"I don't want to live,but..","I have friends, and family but they feel so fake.What I mean is that my friends don't feel like real friends and my family doesn't support me they say I have no hope no future, I'm too stupid, or I'm going to end up in a take out place and serve hamburgers. I'm tired of life, I don't have any motivation. I went to a therapist but they don't help me at all. I want to end it but I feel pathetic turning to suicide. I cry on a daily basis I don't know what to do anymore."
1068,The not so easy easy option,I am a coward and have thought about suicide but never done anything about it.Am scared I will fail and have to face the humiliation and stigma.
1069,Should I go on?,I've been contemplating suicide for awhile now.
1070,"I don't want to rant on how I'm going to kill myself, I am not there yet, but I",I need someone to talk to.
1071,Suicide Pact,I have no reason to live anymore.
1072,*Please Read* For those thinking of committing suicide.,My Director's son just recently committed suicide. Words cannot express how much my heart hurts learning of this. Mind you I've never met his son but I still feel for his father and his family. Please know that taking your own life no matter how much you're hurting affects everyone even those you may not directly know. Life is precious.
1073,Can't push forward,I'm so very tired of walking through this endlessly dark tunnel with no light at the end of it.
1074,rip joanne + steve,
1075,I'm worthless,"Everything in my life has gone wrong. I have been unemployed now since February and haven't had any luck in finding a job because I get very bad anxiety attacks when I go out in public, so I rarely leave the house. The anxiety is actually the main reason why I had to quit my job as a delivery driver at Papa John's. I have a condition called Asperger's Syndrome which is a mild form of Autism, the only area of my life that it impairs is my social skills. I have horrible social skills at best and it has led me to develop severe social anxiety, so as a result I have no friends and spend all of my time at home and I'm a very dependant person, so much so that I still live with my parents. I've attempted suicide twice this year, but my parents haven't found out about the attempts. I did see a psychologist last year, but it didn't help. I've had depression since I was 12 and I've seen a total of three psychologists since then and was even put on prozac for about a year, but nothing ever works. I have nothing to look forward to, my life is worthless, all I have to look forward to is being alone and misunderstood."
1076,feeling desperately low and no light at the end of the tunnel,i dont know who to talk to or where to turn all i know is i feel desperately low and can see no light at the end of the tunnel
1077,going to do it,ok lets see how complicated i can make my life. im a girl in England and 14 years old but sometimes it feels like i feel my life is already over. I googled the word lonely this morning and found this site and i feel like this is where i belong. I live in social care as my family arent able to look after me (if you can call them a family!) and i split up with my boyfriend as all he eva did was hit me and tell me im worthless and not good for anything. Ive never had any proper friends and no one eva says anything nice about me. I dont want to live anymore because i know theres no point. im unhappy all the time and all i want to do is cut myself and hurt myself so i can see the blood and know its hurting in front of me. is there anyone feeling like me? i dont think so! so all i want to do is finish it all. ive made up my mind and no one is going to make me change my mind so dont even anyone try. so ive made up my mind and now i just want to find out the best and easiest and most least painful way of killing myself. I sometimes think of jumping off somewhere and it will all be over. but then i tihnk I want to take an overdoes so they can find me and realise how guilty they should all feel. I dont want to be found when i haven't died as that would make things just worse. But I dont want to die alone. I want to do it properly and I want someone to show me how or tell me what I need to do. My family wont care and its not surprising as they never did care when I was alive so let them feel guilty about what they did to me. that is all that is left!
1078,I don't deserve to live...,My life is just meaningless.
1079,No Purpose,"Well where do i start really? Has anyone ever had the feeling that their life is nothing more than a pathetic, meaningless waste of space with no purpose? It's the feeling i have started to develop about my own life over the past weeks."
1080,I hate everything about it,"At my age I'd never think I would be jobless living with my parents who just went bankrupt, lawsuits against me for my debt, not able to go to school because I can't afford it and all the while screwing up the best relationship I have ever had in my life because of my insecurities and depression. I don't want to live without this man and I feel like I have no purpose in life. All I do is mess things up, all on my own. I hate myself, I don't feel a purpose to live anymore."
1081,It's getting worse and I don't know how much more I can possibly take...,"I've been really depressed for as long as I can remember... I guess it's kind of a part of me now. But lately I think it's getting worse. Much worse. The past few weeks have just been a roller coaster of emotions. They come out of nowhere. Some days I'll feel on top of the world. But most days I have no motivation and my world is grey. All I can manage to do is write. It's like I've got this huge black cloud looming over me and theres no way to get rid of it... It's like I'm stuck in my own misery srticken world while everyone around me is living their sound, happy, shallow little lives. Obsessing over homecoming and boys and clothes and the biggest dilemma they face is who they're hanging out with that night... It just frustrates me so much how they can be totally oblivious to everything else besides themselves and whatever drama may be going on in highschool... While I'm stuck, with this horrible isolation and lonliness from everyone, sitting alone and quietly staring off into space, everyone else is all social and I just can't be like that."
1082,raped by teacher,"when i was 9 i was raped by one of my teachers, and for the next 2 years until i left i was abused by him. i have never been able to hold down a relationship, i don't like sex and don't like to be touched. now in my mid 40's i know i will never have a normal life. i've felt depressed and suicidal to some extent ever since i was raped but it as gown worse in the last year or so. some nights i take sleeping tablets, more than the prescribed dose hoping one day it will be one tablet to many"
1084,Randomly down,"I've already tried professional help, but it made everything worse. What used to feel ""fake"" is now suddenly real."
1085,Im having a hard time!!!,"So here I am again, months and months into taking medications that is suppose to cure all, right? NOPE-it’s not working (NEVER DOES FOR VERY LONG)-it did for a little while but now I feel like I’m back to where I started. I hate life, I hate myself. I have so much anger that I want to crash my car into a tree, but for what I don’t even know. What the hell am I so mad about? Why do things never change for me?"
1086,I wonder how much is enough..,"I wonder how much of your life you should spend living for others.. I imagine myself on my deathbed, old, with my children and grandchildren.. This is the time of your life when you usually say ""I had a good, happy and fulfilling life, I can die now"".. Except that isn't the case.. I will never have a child of my own and happiness is nowhere is sight... for years.."
1087,whats the point,"My ex broke up with me a few days ago. Im absolutely devastated. I have been on antidepressants for a year, but this is a major trig. I cant live without him. I just cant. We were meant to be. How can he say its over?? Everything was perfect according to him...i cant go on..."
1089,Just need somebody to listen,"I don't even know if information on ENA is safe anymore.. (well if it ever was).. but this is the internet. Regardless, I feel like I just have to tell *somebody* since I can't tell anybody really and I keep going around acting like things are fine now."
1090,I need help!,"I don't mean to put a downer on peoples day/night...but I don't know where else to turn! I am in a place I really don't want to be! I think about suicide and self harm alot, and constantly want to make the real world just STOP! I'm scared because I've cut myself alot lately, and can't stop crying...I need help! and I don't know who to ask...Sorry if my text is depressing...help me anyone?"
1092,I'm only sleeping...,"Hello,"
1093,I need to commit myself,"Hi, I'm 26. I called the local psych hospital, and they said I would need $3500 to admit myself for 3-4 days. I just need to do it. I need to go, get away from the outside world. I have had thoughts of overdosing, but I don't WANT to kill myself. I just don't want to LIVE this way anymore. I've thought about this for a long time, and now is the time I think I'm ready to go."
1094,URGENT! A possibly suicidal friend,"My friend who I love very dearly has been struggling for years with depression and self-sabotaging behaviour. She at times drinks too much, and has got into trouble on many occasion. I've watched her go through this for years but for me the final straw came a few weeks ago when she got very drunk at a party, got quite abusive and made several misjudgements, just acted in a way that not her and not acceptable. I didn't speak to her for a week because I wasn't sure what to tell her. I recently sent her a message detailing why exactly I was upset with her and that I was worried about her self-destructive ways and that I wanted to help her get better. Now she has just sent me a message saying how sorry she is that she has ruined everything, and how few up she is with her own behaviour. To be honest her message sounded suicidal. I don't know her address as she's recently moved and I can't get through to her on the phone or email. Who do I contact about this? What do I do? I'm worried sick and would go to her house but I have no idea where it is, and not sure anyone I know does either."
1095,Feelings of suicide,"I feel like this a lot. I'll be passing a river and i think i could maybe jump in, or i could just stab myself... I don't think i can actually do it, which makes me feel worse. I feel like i'm stuck being alive."
1096,Lack of hope again?,"Well, A few months ago a girl I was seeing had told me she just wanted to be friends. We were dating for about a year and I took it very hard. I stopped my life. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, I had a vomit bucket in my car cause I would randomly vomit. I was so depressed. The whole time I did go to work. I do sales and this has been very challenging. The stress of making quota and talking to people I've never met and that don't want to talk to me is challenging. I was contemplating suicide. I couldn't go on living with the pain I had been feeling. I started couseling and was referred to a psychiatrist. I have been put on many medications (seroqual, Lemitian(?), and some other anti depressent.) These meds have allowed me to get sleep and start to feel a bit more normal. I still have a lot of pain but it seems to be more managable. I havn't told my friends that I'm on meds for depression. I feel shame in this. I also have been trying to avoid drinking cause I know it only makes things worse. this last weekend I went out both nights with fiends and I lost self contole and drank. They were dinking and I joined them. Yesterday I felt horrible, I was betting myself up for doing this. I was filled with guilt and shame. My mood was low and I was feeling soy fo myself. The weekends are the hardest. this is what I have been doing for the past 10 years with my friends. If I stay in I feel even worse."
1097,A reason to live.,"Most nights I would turn off the lights, listen to music, drink a few beers and just think about a good reason to live one more day. For a long time this worked. The reasons I thought of gave me strength and hope. But lately I'm having a hard time finding a good enough reason. For years the part that wanted life always won out against the part of me that wanted death. The light always won over the darkness. But now that light is starting to fade and the darkness is building in strength. I'm loosing the fight that I have fought for so long. But now I'm just tired. So very tired. Most of the time I feel nothing but numb and sometimes I feel fine. And other times I would feel sad, sadness so overwhelming so powerful that I think I'm loosing my mind."
1098,I just want to get my story out and I hope people will listen to me and give me advice.,I'm just going to be straightforward with you guys:
1099,Not Dead,"im sorry if any of you thought i was died, but unfortunatley im still here. not that any of you really care but i thought i just walk by and say hi. im currently recovering from a severe mental breakdown. and yes, i probably shouldnt be on here but, i just had a memory flash while serving the web, and forgot all about this forum. anway, sorry for my spelling mistakes, as im pumped up on drugs at the moment. feeling very weak. can barely walk. i doubt anyone remembers me anyway. so yeah, bye"
1100,New,Hello all...my names Santino and well I'm new to the forums. That said I hate to dump all this out their but what the hell might as well. I've struggled with depression/anxiety since the ripe old age of 9-10 on a daily basis. I have intense thoughts of suicide/homicide to the point where its crippling. I can't sleep anymore unless i'm physically exhausted. All I want is to die...I'm sick of life and I think my final days are upon me. I just want to watch the world burn. All day these sick thoughts that i don't even want to get into run through my head. I've been in and out of psych wards since i was 14. I've cut myself had past suicide attempts so on and so forth. I thought about hanging myself but i'm more of a gun shot to the head type of guy which luckily my dad has one. Well just thought I'd throw that out there. All thats left now is to get my hands on that beautiful little pistol (which is locked up unfortunately but i'll find a way to get it if it kills me...haha) and write up a note. Guess I'll burn in hell for all eternity its better than this life for sure. Later
1101,"I really am in a hole - NO HOPE, PURE EMPTINESS","No, I don't have a problem with friends nor self-esteem nor with a boyfriend dumping me."
1102,Life vs. Death,"I truly cannot remember a time in my life where I was happy. Each day is exactly the same for me; wake up, work, sleep, repeat. Friends are nonexistent, and my family has nothing to do with me. I have tried to change this- I've tried to make myself a better person, but this only led to people taking advantage of me. I turned to God for help, only to have nothing to show for it. I guess I'm only living for death."
1103,Wish I could just sleep around the clock,"Ok, I have decided I just don't want to be here anymore. I can't kill myself (yet), as that would kill my mom and I would not do that to her. Thoughout my life (and I am not young), I have thought about ending it all many times. But I took a vow I would NEVER do that while my parents are still living. So instead I have opted for a slow form of suicide, which is to say I smoke cigarettes and drink a lot of wine."
1104,How do I tell my boyfriend I won't be here when he gets home.,"Iv tried for the last 3 years to be happy and enjoy life but nothing works. I don't think I'm cut out for life, I'm tired of this lame circle. Eat sleep work. I'm going to kill myself tomorrow. I just don't know how to tell my boyfriend I'm leaving. I just can do this for another 60 years. I'm done with life."
1105,I'm going to do it.,"Well, I haven't been on here in a LOOONG time, heck I don't even know why I'm writing this, but then again, I don't even know why I do anything anymore. I've decided that I'm absolutely 100% sure that I'm committing suicide. I'm done with struggling in a world and society that doesn't want me and didn't want me in the first place. I used to think that I could perhaps live maybe those 50-60 more years, but as time goes on it just becomes all that much more unbearable. It never stops; every time I think my life has some glimmer or hint of hope, turns out I was wrong and I'm back to square one."
1106,one year on?,"so this time last year i was in hospital recovering from my first attempt and here i am one year later still sure im not going to get old,slightly better off friend wise,still no family to talk too,still punishing myself,still lonely."
1107,i have to end this insanity,"im so stressed out and overwhelmed with everything, i cant live this life anymore. my life is meaningless, and nobody cares about me what so ever, and thats a fact. i have to end this insanity i dont know what else to do"
1109,At lowest point. Grasping at will to live.,"I can barely put together a proper sentence right now. I've just discovered a female american student who has been staying with my family, who I have become very attracted to, has been seeing a guy. This guy just turned up at our door at 12.30am, to with I answered, asking for said girl."
1110,just life...,"Lately, I've been feeling like absolute ****. I just got denied a job I had my hopes on. I literally spent weeks on it and got denied. I'm currently unemployed. Did a few odd jobs here and there for a Temp Agency in my area, but I need ""static"" work."
1111,Thinking a lot about death and an end,"I'd like to start by saying I am aware of all the reasons why suicide is not the answer. Regardless, I still find myself thinking about it constantly these days and need some help to get through it, I guess. I have never before considered it more seriously then I am now."
1112,Hang On!,"Believe me, I've been suicidal for 4-5 years at least. It happens every couple months and I think long and hard, and I've suffered from panic attacks a whole lot in those 4-5 years (As recently as this last November up until the end of May). The girl I was living with just dumped me a month and a week ago, then I found out she was seeing someone else 3 weeks later, then I got laid off."
1113,Suicide after parent's death,"Hi all,"
1114,people can act so low !,"ive just read about the lowest thing that can happen these people should be ashamed please read on,"
1115,Why am I even alive?,"I'm 31, been working the same job for 5 and a half years, sure I don't like it, but it's a job. I still live with my mom when I should be married with kids. A number of my friends have houses, are married and have kids already and here I am afraid of life. I always get screwed over by women since I was 13, which makes me hate them even more. I can't leave my comfort zone because I'm scared. All of my friends are busy so I don't hang with them very much. The same band I've been with off and on for 10 years and haven't gone ANYWHERE. My only older brother is estranged from the family and doesn't care. My dad and I don't get along either. I don't even know why I'm still alive. I cut daily and think of ways to die."
1116,"I am troubled, Please help!","My girlfriend broke up with me because she ""lost feelings"" for me."
1117,My life is over..,My life is over.
1118,Will I Be Locked Up?,"This morning I was crying, asking God to let me die. I am feeling a bit better, but I have been like this on and off for the past few years. Today I was serious contemplating ways I could end my life like using a knife, suffocating in my closet, or jumping off some overpasses near my house. I don't think I could go through with it, but it was sort of a relief to think I had options."
1119,I don't know what to do anymore.,"I'm 18 years old, fresh out of high school. Throughout my entire school life I never really felt like I fit in. I was always different than other people. I remember in first grade I was so shy I used to sit and talk to the yard duty teacher during recess. I've stayed home hundreds and hundreds of days because going to school was unbearable. I later recognized this as social anxiety."
1120,I need freedom,"I need a perfect way to die. Please help me. I tried jumping, pills, and hanging. Didn’t work for me. What I’m I doing wrong. The pills just made me throw up. Hanging just knocked me out. And jumping I don’t even want to remember that."
1121,It's me again,"I wish this is my last post, my life is really over now. I always thought that I will kill myself because I'm sick of being hurt but it turns out that I will kill myself out of guilt because I hurt a lot of people. At least my death will do a favour"
1122,Done with this.,"I want to start by saying that I'm not sure why I'm writing in the first place. I guess I am just really sad and really, really alone right now and I want to express myself."
1123,Im done,"Well I have reached another rock bottom in my life and I am really tired of it. I have thrown hints left and right to people to say hey i am thinking about killing myself i need help or someone to talk to...but all i get is its ok, you will make it through this, your strong...you will pull through things will get better. well thats all fine and everythign but I been done this road before. Last Oct. I tried to kill myself, cut my wrists and taken a bottle of pain killers...dumb me I sent out a mass text message before I took the pills so my friend showed his head in just as I finished drinking my last beer and finishing off the pill bottle. I was extremly angry that I didnt get to finish the job because someone else stopped me.....so here I am again almost a year later. This time I am deployed and no one really seems to care much...so I set a date an it seems like the stress has lifted off my shoulders. I have written my will and ready to transfer all of my money into my loved ones account. Now tell me why I shouldnt go through with it? Do you really think I am going to tell people I want to kill myself after last time I was taken to the local Mental Hospital by police? Held there for 3 weeks? Just because I attempted to kill myself? Well this time I will not be stopped by anyone...got a date set, eill done, finances in order ready to go from this cruel an heartless world. Everyone seems to think that it is ok to sneak around your partner and cheat and this an that. Well im tired of putting my heart on the line in this mordern screwed up world..Goodbye."
1124,Best friend and love of my life left me with nothing...,"Hey,"
1125,After Attempt !,Last week in april of this year I attempted to kill myself by slitting my wrists but I failed obviously. I butchered my wrists and now I have many scares on both wrists and im obsessed with covering them up. I am out of work so I dont do much but still go out and thinking what the hell did I do ???
1126,Unsure,"I don't even know why I'm writing this. I shouldn't feel like this, my life isn't bad, but..."
1127,Maybe just need to talk...,"I don't really know where I should start, so I guess I'll just start talking. I'm tired. I'm so tired of fighting with my wife and so tired of working until 3 in the morning every night and I'm starting to worry that my life is never going to amount to anything. I'm a psychology graduate student, so I recognize the classic signs of depression. Even so, I can't help but feel that the only way for me to stop feeling like a completely worthless bastard is to kill myself. I've cut myself in the past (first was accross the wrists, second time was after I learned something of anatomy and cut myself accross the radial arteries), but I realize now that I didn't have the conviction to do it. So fastforward 10 years, I've been married, on drugs, divorced, off drugs, and remarried. I'm now trying to get my doctoral degree, but I can't seem to get my * * * * together. Everthing I do seems to turn to * * * * . My wife criticizes me and says (as of tonight) that I'm worthless and she wonders why she married me. She's probably right in a lot of ways. She works very hard, but she can't understand that just because I do most of my work from home and on the computer, my work is killing me. I'm smart, but I'm having such a hard time keeping my eye on the ""prize."" I don't believe in God, so no help there. My colleagues joke about killing themselves on a daily basis, so I'm sure they see my comments in much the same way - as a joke. I initially thought this would pass, but I find my thoughts drifting more and more to the loaded gun I keep in my closet. Normally, this would be a fairly innocuous fact, but lately it's begun to lurk in my mind like a hateful fly. I know it wouldn't hurt...it would be over in an instant. It seems so easy sometimes, especially since I started drinking heavily. I don't want to hurt anybody or put a guilt-trip on anybody...I just want to stop feeling like this. I've felt this way since I was probably 15 or so, and I'm 30 now. I want it to stop, but I keep thinking that surely things have to start looking up soon. It's so hard though, when even your closest ally accuses you of being no good. I wish my dad was here. He always knew what to say. Thanks for listening, faceless strangers."
1128,Im Alone,im 15. i live in Ireland. I am suicidal. Its so weird. I used to think i had friends but now ive come to the realisation that i really havent. this year in school i got really close to alot of people and they thought i was happy cz some of the time i was. i told a couple of the girls about myself(about me being suicidal)
1129,Pat on the back,"I would like to say, for all of you that make it your job to save someone from suicide, how human of you! You have little resources stopping suicide over the internet, but you do it any way. You take it as your personal job, to let that one person that came here for help, know he is not alone and to guide him back onto his path. When I watch the world around me, I sometimes only see the negative things around me, but when I come here I see the good, the possibilities. If someone says there is no more good in the world, remind them of these posts here, let them read the next 1000 posts on this site. This is another great example of how great the human race is and what we could possibly be. Everyone pulling together and caring more about another human being and giving your time and your support and your advice and your empathy, it makes a difference. I just want to say thank you, I have something to live up to."
1130,Numb,"I woke up this morning to a phone call from my old high school. I graduated this last year, so I was really confused why they would be calling me. I guess this morning a really close friend of mine committed suicide by swallowing handfuls of over-the-counter Tylenol and Ibuprofen and the guidance counselors were going through her cell phone and calling all the contacts."
1131,i need some help....,"i have a history of depression, self harm, and attempts of suicide.. thought i'd give a little background there.."
1132,Life sucks and am planning to go to god,"people I'm useless can't get a job , can't get a g/f , had a fight with someone on the tube broke his jaw and nose and he barged me."
1133,Threats in an LDR,"I'm in a long-distance relationship, which is challenging enough without any added stress, but my girlfriend lately (and with increasing frequency) has said she'd kill herself if we ever broke up. I try to bring the discussion back around to how we both should want to respond to the demise of our relationship, if it ever came to that, but that suicide threats have no place on the table. I asked her if she'd want to be in a relationship in which I stayed more out of fear than out of love, and she said, ""I don't care. If you can't have me, no one will."" I've never been involved with anyone who said such things - nor do I have a lot of experience with depression or other mental-health concerns. Are there any effective strategies for dealing with this?"
1134,"My goals,are ""impossible"" to achieve,suicide is the only way??","Well,I dont even know how to write this down ."
1135,im sick and tired of being alone,i can't take it anymore. i've had it.
1136,A lost friend,"I guess the only place to start is at the beginning, I come from a family of drunks, my parents were alcos and so were my relos anyway in 5th class in school I met this girl named Leanne and she was really kind to me and she used to share her colouring pencils and textas with me and I have never forgotten her and how kind she was and now I'm like 48, when I was 16 I was in the main street of the city where I lived and out of no where she was there in front of me, she kept turning to look at me and all that and all I ing did was stand there, I was so shy, I missed her enormously when she moved away but for the short time I knew her she left me with a lasting impression, if a 11 or 12 year old could really love someone I loved her but was to shy to tell her how I felt."
1137,It's done!,Loose ends all tied up.
1138,Cant see a reason to go on.,If you do not see a future for yourself and can’t escape the mistakes of the past is there any point in continuing?
1139,why should I bother anymore?,I havent had any friends after the age of 11.
1140,Lost it all,"Lost it all in a span of one yr...my law school career, my health ( dormant herpes has now activated to show it's ugly head just as I embark on a wonderful relationship) i have nothing now. I am nobody now. No man will want me. My dreams of happily ever after were just within reach. How cruel life can be."
1141,being bashed by everyone except from my son,my lady and i recently broke up. I am very hurt but I am hiding it with a fake smile. She was my first everything and I am lost if she was the best i will ever get. I ask myself everyday if another lady would want to treat me better.
1142,No turning back,I've made up my mind. I may even blame myself for not carrying out the inevitable later down the track because I know that things can only get worse. I have zero self esteem and it shows up overtly whenever I talk . I appeared foolish when i tried to talk to people and no one will ever take me seriously. I can never achieve anything in life be in work or in a relationship. I was stupid enough for a female colic to take me on an emotional roller coaster ride. I have never forgiven myself for falling into her manipulative trap and I have put myself in a damn awkard position in the office. I do not wish to see her face.
1143,Major depression - dilemma,To make a long story short:
1144,The fallout of suicide,"I just found out my brother killed himself. He borrowed a friend's car on Father's Day and never came back. They just found him in a ravine - he shot himself. He left behind parents, sisters, kids, grandkids. He's led a very troubled life. I want do-overs and I can't have them. Rest in peace, brother. You are gone, but won't ever be forgotten. I will see you in Heaven some day. I'm sorry you wouldn't or couldn't come to me for help."
1146,doing what they keep telling me..,"I don't usually join forums, but I have nowhere else to go, and I have nobody to speak to about this."
1147,i am alone,"i know igo to sleep havin taken many ibuprofen pills in the hope i dont wake up .i cut my self in hope one day ill go too far but no one would notice ,its sad looking up your friends on facebook and seeing their successful lives, i have two notes ready i know where and when i read the lovly bones or watch what dreams become i think there is a better place,its gotta be better than this no freinds ,family that dont care and only call when they want something,wish id never been born.i gave up drinking after the first attempt and even after that no one bothered i know its up to me to get help but my doctors a pratt who id like to punch and if no one else cares why should i?"
1148,no more,my last near miss was the closest ant most serious yet
1149,please help me.,well there are a couple of things i have issues with but ill keep it as short as possible.
1150,demonic epiphany,Im at the end
1151,Suicial thoughts about appearance,"I'm really beginning to lose hope as to ever developing a proper sexual relationship with a girl. I feel so goddamn ugly and rejected, like i'm damaged goods or my face was a birth defect. Nobody ever wanted to go out with me, and people on the internet keep telling me I'm ""average."" Who really wants ""average"" anyway? Can I pretty much just forget about ever having love at this point? How come all my friends are able to do it, but I can't?"
1152,Am I suicidal?,I know that sounds like a really weird question.
1153,Ive had enough,No matter how hard I try I just can't attract anyone
1154,"Up down, all around, it's useless.. no.. I'm useless",I used to be worth something. I used to be worth a lot. The bullying and abuse knocked me down. The rest of life tore me down.
1155,Does anyone know where andi8172 lives?,"Im feeling desperate, I dont know what else to say to him, please help me."
1156,everythings going wrong,"not like anyone really cares anway but this time its no more bull****, im leaving this world for good. everything in my life is going wrong, everything is starting to slowly decline, everything is starting to get worse. its all over. im giving it tuesday. nothing ever goes right anymore. i could list more than 50 reasons."
1157,"*Pfft*, why not? Don't care anymore...","hThis post is specifying that i don't care anymore. But, i must if i'm taking the time to write."
1158,I cant gain control over my life,"I cant gain control over my life, I cant cope with losing my girl 7 months ago. I cant seem to find work after applying at over 50 jobs going to 4 interviews. I cant take out a loan to live off, my car is about to break down. She said needs needs time to get over her ex that left her over 2 years ago but its been 7 months since she broke it off."
1160,worst day of my life 1 year ago.,"okay, I know many people will probably ignore this,as there have been so many posts on suicide recently, and obviously they take a lot of empathy and emotional wellbeing out of those trying to help. But I need to post."
1161,I need to get away,"I feel that I need to get away. Take myself out of my home environment, travel, go somewhere. However, I also feel that if I take this time to reflect and try to fix myself, I will get even more lonely and depressed. I feel that no one is able to help me but myself. I have been living this way for almost 2 years. I need a divine intervention. I pray to God and go to church every week, yet I am still in this whole. I have the urge to just pack up and go to the beach and live out of my car for a few days, just to know I can survive... I just want to take off somewhere and get the he!! out of dodge! I do have a therapist appt next week, but it's not going to change anything..."
1162,im to tired now,my body aches.. my heart hurts.. its that empty hollow cold broken feeling...
1163,Not willing to hold out much longer,"When I was 18, I decided that if I wasn't able to enjoy my life by the time I reached my mid-20s, I would end it. Right now, I'm reaching that point, and I'm fairly certain that 2009 will mark the end of my life."
1164,"Feeling hollow, lost, alone","I feel like this could technically go several places, but considering the subject, I decided it ought to go here. Please bear with me; I may make this overlong. I am terrible about getting to the point."
1166,Suicide is Painless,Hello
1167,farewell,"well the voyage begins in about 6 hours, why im even bothering to come on here i dont really know. i guess i have no one else to talk about this to. firstly, some of you have been very helpful over these last few months, i thank you deeply for that. others, people like ""bugbug"" have given me abuse (yes, it happens even on a suicide forum). all i can say to those people is, thanks for pushing me that one step closer and giving me yet more reasons."
1168,I want help and my parents won't let me,"I am 17 years old and I have been suicidal since thirteen. The feelings are so bad now, I feel as if I should be in the hospital, but my parents won't let me do anything, not even a hotline. They say that since if I do anything I'll end up in the hospital, which is what I want, but they claim they can't afford it, but I know for a fact that it's only a couple hundred for two weeks, and they make ten times that in the same period!"
1169,Need help...,I've decide criate one account out here because I know I'm not the only with suicidal problemas and the people will anderstand what I say...
1170,wow,"I'm alive. I don't freakin believe it. You'd think a 3 phase could supply enough amps to kill, but it just knocked me out for a couple days and burned the heck out of me. God damn. Anyway, it hurts to type."
1171,I am going to kill myself if I can't find a release...,"I need to get away, just drive and take some time to myself. I don't have much money and no family. I was thinking of going to a beach somewhere, but don't know if I can do it. Are there any things I could do to just get away from here and spend some time to myself somewhere? I can't stay at a friend's house because no one has time for me. I need to remove myself from my surroundings and judgmental people and just start new."
1172,How do you tell a friend you're not ok?,"My friend doesn't realize how bad I'm really feeling. I think sometimes, she doesn't know how to be here for me. I'm just not ok right now, and I really need to see her. I haven't seen her in over a week, so it's not like I'm being selfish... I told her I had a really bad night last night, that my mom hurt me bad, and I said I would really like to see her today... I really want to tell her I don't want to live anymore, but I'm not going to. I think it would make me feel better to just see her maybe meet for dinner and have a drink or something. She told me she is at a conference and will text me back... I know she can't read my mind, so I'm trying not to hang on every minute she's not available. I don't want to seem desperate, but I also need to reach out to her and make her realize that I need her right now. How do I tell her I'm scared, that I need her support and that I need her to meet me somewhere? I just need to be with someone right now... I don't want to scare her away... I don't need much, just for her to listen and to be able to be with her for a bit."
1173,I'm not sure.,"Well, I don't know if anyone can help. I've basically wanted to die for over 10 years now. I can't say that I'm depressed. I'm pretty happy, really. I'm 39, I'm dating a model 10 years younger than me. She's beautiful. Last year I went around the world, saw so many things. I've had an incredible life. Everyone I love is still alive, and cares about me deeply. No deaths in the family, really. I was married for 10 years, one of the best in the world in what I do. Now I'm on disability, so I get paid pretty good money to do whatever I want. Which I do so many different things. Socialize, have fun. I have a huge support system of people who really care about me. I really care about them too. Anyway, for the past 10 years or so I've been pushing people away, and at the same time I've been making amends. I'm pushing my girlfriend away right now. I pushed my wife away. I've pushed away the people who love me. Not outright. Just by making sure everything is even, clean slate. Then I make it up in my head that they are all bad people. Which they aren't. I accuse them of things they didn't do. Anyway, I don't think that I'm doing that because I'm crazy. I think that I'm doing it because I want to die. Which I do. Maybe I am crazy. But, I want to die. Basically I just don't want to be here anymore. I don't want any lose ends when I go though. I guess that I'm just not happy, in my life I've gotten and done everything I've ever wanted to do or get. I'm still not happy. I still just want to go away, vanish. I've tried every psych med out there. I've had electroshock. Nothing helps. I'm not whining, I'm not being a Primadonna. I just don't want to be here anymore. I do everything you are supposed to do, it doesn't help. I've tried everything. I'm actually getting close to a point now where I could consider everything in order. I don't know. I've thought about changing careers, doing something else. I've tried a lot of different things. Maybe being a musician? I'm horrible at that, maybe it would be a challenge? I don't know. I'm not really sure. I've been trying so many things. I still am not happy. I think that 'not happy' really isn't the description I'm looking for, because that implies sad. I just don't see any reason to stay around. Maybe I am sad right this minute, but most of the time I'm not. Still, always, I'm on track for sewing things up and keeping things even. I guess that inside I'm always sad. I just don't know why. Maybe I'm just paranoid delusional. Maybe thats whats making me sad. I don't think so though. I think that I'm keeping everyone away because I want to die. I'm so confused. I've been to so many doctors, on so many medications. Nothing helps."
1174,What are ways to kill yourself quickly,if you don't have a gun or anything to overdose with?
1175,I make a mess of everything and over it.,Hey guys
1176,I don't know whether I can cope with life...,I posted on this site earlier about my doubts about going to college. People gave me some advice but deep inside of me...I wasn't convinced.
1177,I want go.,"I have always loved nature, travel, art, dance etc... but those things cost money and we don't have alot of it, I am very close with nature and I never get tired of traveling, infact it drives me up the wall to stay in the same place but cause my mothers sick I get to go pretty much no where and I'm always in this small apartment and I bearly ever get go for long walks cause of my grandma thinking I'll get kidnapped and by law I have to a parent with me from 9am to 3pm (some where around that time) I have no friends to go with me, mostly cause the kids around here arnt the best people to hang out with so I'm pretty much a loner but that dosent bug me, it's just that the things I love more then my own life have been taken away and the only hope I can find anymore is my dog, I just want to travel and be myself but at my age with a sick mother and an old grandma and they both hate going anywhere, I'm stuck here, I would run off and join the circus if I could but theirs no where for me to go."
1178,yesterday,Hi
1179,Nothing anymore,Latly it just feels like theirs no hope for anything when im a person whos always been happy until a few years ago and even then it was not this bad...
1180,I don't think i'll make it...,"I have never thought of suicide before...until now. I have had so much crap thrown my way this year. Starting with the most horribly painful break up and my father suddenly dying almost 4 months ago. Everyone else is married or getting married, having babies or finished having babies...i feel like like is flying past me and i'll never catch up. I feel like i have no fight left in me."
1182,One good reason.,Give me a good reason not to shoot myself in the head.
1183,Why do most people seem to spontaneously stop being suicidal as soon as their teen years are over?,I seem to have missed that particular boat.
1184,quick and painless,"I cant stop hurting, I need a quick and painless death. I lost my girl about 6 months ago and its never stopped hurting. I left town a few days ago which she knew about and today just told me she loves me and wants me to come back be with her and be safe but now im thinking its just a con, i i havent seen her yet. and now i just did something really bad and its a matter of time before im found and put in jail for 15+ years. My life fell apart and keeps falling apart. I just wanted to see my friend i didnt think it was a felony. im tried of the hell im in I just want it to go away, a week ago I went on the wrong side of the road and challenged an 18 wheeler, the only thing that stopped me was the though of everyone talking about it, since then I decided im better off going into the mountains of KY where I wont be found for 50 years and by then thell be nothing left plus ill just be missing not dead. ill never feel for another girl again and ill never be free."
1186,Had enough of you all,"making my life one long misery, yes im talking about you society. I wanna try and somehow vent my anger by typing this. who am i trying to talk to, its society, you stink. Everyday, i go through enough, pain and anguish. But oh no, you all like piling it on, as you go about your boring mundane lives, not caring about you you hurt or upset. People, or should i say humans have reached a thin line with me. Im sick of you all. Daily i struggle with Many disorders, exhausting debilitating ones, such as Schizophrenia, OCD, bipolar. But i always find people couldnt care less about how they hurt you. Regulaly, i get called wierdo, ugly, creep, freak, loser, crazy, every sterotypical, ignorant name you can think of. So here i am, with my final message to you all,"
1187,No further forward,It's been some weeks since I posted in this section and I have been mostly absent from this forum since then while I have tried to work through things.
1189,"me again, life sucks",sorry if you people think i post to much but i really need help.
1190,suicidal anyone?,I wanted to share my story and maybe it will help others who are suicidal.
1191,Worth a Shot.,"So, i guess the reason I am here in the first place, is I am thinking of suicide. Now before you judge me, this is not a cry for help, nor is it a reach for attention. Theirs just a certain safety and anonymity in posting on a random thread, lost in the sea of the inter webs. Almost like a dirty little secret that no one i know in real life knows about. But all of you reading this do."
1192,I just want the pain to go away,"I just want this numbness, this pain, this bleeding inside, to end. Life is getting worse, the days are getting longer, the nights colder. Then end is no where in sight. What is the point of waking up day after day to a boyfriend who hates me, a mother who I constantly disappoint, a brother who hates everything about me? I feel enslaved, opressed by this world. And I'm exhausted. I just want to sleep, but I just lay in bed, chest tight with anxiety, stomach twisted in nervous knots, mind cluttered with a whirlwind of swirling emotions. I just want to die. I live on the 29th floor. my dad killed himself 8 years ago when I was 13. Why can't I just jump and end this pain?"
1193,Struggling.,I have had a pretty up and down couple of months and now i am really struggling to find any hope in my future. This is the closest I have ever been to ending it.
1194,I've had enough,Hi everyone I'm new here.
1195,Please pray for me,For those who are religious please pray for me that I will have quick painless death soon.
1196,I'm just kinda lost...,"I'm not really sure what I'm looking for...I typed into google ""I don't want to kill myself"" and I found this site. Truth is, I don't want to kill myself in anyway, but some times I want to disappear. I don't want to exist anymore."
1197,I don't know where else to turn,"I've been feeling like this (Hopeless, worthless, helpless) for maybe about 3 years, maybe 2. I was in an emotional abusive relationship, and I think that was the start of these feelings, because before then, I didn't feel anything like that. I was a relatively happy young adult."
1198,given up and need some peace,hi i don't really know how to start this off but my depression started about 6 yrs ago.. i don't know why or how i think even as a teen i had problems fitting in and i never really had anyone to talk to.. it started affecting my studies and pretty soon i was really overwhelmed ... i was so stressed to the point that i took 25 tylenol pills and ended up in the hospital i had to stay for 3 days until i was evaluated by a psychiatrist... i graduated high school doin pretty well but then i decided to go pursue a law degree and about 2 yrs ago the depression resurfaced.. cause i never really dealt with my issues i just buried myself in studying and spent most of my time alone tryin to avoid people because of the shame of what i did.
1199,Reasoning and Method?,"I feel like there are many reasons why I should kill myself. First off, and most importantly, I am in an insane amount of debt that I will probably not be able to pay off for a really long time. The main thing that bothers me about this is that I haven’t enjoyed my life for the most part for the last 10 years, yet I’m going to be paying for all the * * * * I did for the next 20. It doesn’t feel worth it to me. Secondly, while I know Aaron(my boyfriend) loves me, I feel as if I am a burden upon him. I am always depressed and have a hard time enjoying myself doing anything. He was right when he said I will probably never be happy. And all the more reason I need to stop bringing him down. I wish I could talk to him about how empty I feel but every time I do I get the same “I’m going to break up with you if you don’t cut this * * * * out” speech. So now I’m scared to say anything for fear I will loose him, the only thing in my life that I have left. But for the most part it is excruciating to deal with these feelings. I have trouble sleeping every night and I usually get up and cry in the other room so Aaron doesn’t hear me. I know that I cry too much, but I feel so depressed. He basically thinks that I just cry to get attention and to make myself look like a victim. I’m not a victim, I’m just not a worthwhile person. I have spent many years trying to find ways to be ok with myself, yet I’m still worthless to me and everyone who knows me. Which is very few people. The only person I have a real relationship with is Aaron, and the rest of my family I have absolutely no emotional connection to and just visit them out of obligation, as I’m sure they do the same. I used to think, well at least I’m decent looking, but now I’m just a fat ugly woman. I’ve gained 70lbs since I stopped taking Ritalin and I feel so discouraged that I will never have a normal body again. I used to love sex but now I feel so fat an unattractive that I have a hard time enjoying myself while doing it. I have to imagine myself as someone pretty and desirable. Since I just learned that if I die, student loan debt does not transfer to the next of kin, I have nothing really stopping me from killing myself. Of course there are issues with doing so. First off, how to do it. I’ve tried drugs and they don’t work, I just end up sick and look stupid. Cutting myself obviously doesn’t work since I sliced my hand in half and I still didn’t die. I’m thinking of gassing myself in my car in the garage. I wish I had a gun, that would make the choice easy. And I also don’t want to do it in Aaron’s condo. That would be extremely rude and selfish of me. If I do it, I should just leave here and Aaron could just think that I ran away or something so he wouldn’t have to know I killed myself. I really don’t want to hurt him and that is the hardest thing for me, but I know he’s right, I just * * * * on his good moods, I drag him down and I am insensitive to his needs because I am so absorbed in myself because of my loathing and self hatred. I’m going to think about it some more and hopefully I can come up with a plan by the end of this month. If I don’t get a job soon, I’m going to have to kill myself. It’s my only choice. And don’t try to tell me to go get help. I only have $30 to my name, 140K in debt and bills that have piled up for months, and I haven’t had health insurance in over a year. I can’t afford it and I am not going into some inpatient thing. They don’t listen to you, they hold you involuntarily, they just try to shove pills on you (and not even the ones I want) and send your way with a nice 7k bill to follow. I am merely posting this to see if anyone else has some good ideas on how to kill yourself."
1200,Waiting patiently for the end,"I just don't see the point of living anymore. I don't seem to be able to take the actual steps towards suicide but every night I go to bed and pray to anyone who may be out there that I don't wake up in the morning... And every morning... When I DO wake up, I feel filled with disappointment that I need to live another stupid, painfull, pointless day on this Earth."
1201,Don't Have Much to Live For,It's really amazing how little I know myself.
1202,Looking for a reason,"I... I honestly don't know why I decided to register for this or go about typing this, but I really don't know what else to do.. I have a family that cares for me, I think, but I don't care for them. I feel like an empty shell all of the time. I honestly can't remember the last time I felt happy. I'm trying to find a reason why I shouldn't kill myself, the feelings have been getting worse and worse. I've thought of counseling but there is no way in hell I am going to lie down on a chair and listen to an overpayed shrink saying ""how does this make you feel?"" I just hate living and I want it to stop. I don't want to cause pain for anyone else and there is no way I can talk to anybody about this without them over-reacting , so here I am on my computer and I don't know why."
1203,Er,I am sitting outside of the ER becuase I fear for my life. What is going to happen when I go in? I'm kinda freaked out...
1204,Confession,"Ok, so this is my first time ever mentioning this to anyone else. I thought i would try it out since iv been browsing all over the internet suicide forums and reading other people stories. Curious to know what other people would say if anything at all. So here it goes..."
1205,I think this section should have some good general advice 'stickies' at the top,Do others agree? The site should make it easier for people in need to find help and information.
1206,how should i kill myself ????,i'm 23 years old and it seems every little thing in my life is falling apart.
1207,I'm just too tired to go on,"I'm writing this because I guess I'm just tired of keeping it to myself and I want to see what people think of it, and what better audience is there than the internet? If you haven't figured it out yet, I'm talking about killing myself. I'm not some melodramatic kid who's pissed off at the world, I just don't see the point in going on anymore. Everyday I wake up tired and have to pull myself out of bed to start a pointless day that always ends with me wondering why I haven't grown the balls to finally pull the trigger on myself. I have no friends anymore and I live with my parents who I know love me, but frankly expect me to be this prodigal son who's great at everything. I'm going to a community college and I'm failing two of the four classes I'm taking, I don't have a job, the only girl I ever really liked as an adult treats me like I'm an object for her amusement, and I'm finding it harder and harder to even pretend like I'm normal for the sake of the people around me. Some prodigal son right? I'm not sure when I started feeling like this, but I know that I just don't feel anything anymore except for depression and rage. It's like everything that made me happy just doesn't anymore, I don't have anything to live for. I tried killing myself once before, but due to a weird computer glitch my suicide note didn't go out and I didn't want to just vanish on my family. Divine intervention? Or maybe satan just wants to screw with me for a while longer. Or maybe it was really just a glitch. I used to cry when I thought about killing myself, but now the idea of it energizes me because at least I'm taking a step in a direction, even if many think it's the wrong way. I would have tried again sooner, but awhile ago my dad's best friend killed himself and I couldn't have gone through with it so close to that. I sincerely hope there is not a god, because if there is and it tried to teach me something about suicide by making my dad's friend kill himself or at the very least allowing it, then that's not a god I would want to be a part of, I'd rather burn. Even though I have plenty of problems with my folks, I love them and I don't want to hurt them, but I'm just hurting them by staying around here and I can't take their demands of me anymore. I'm a loser, and it would just be better if I went away forever. If anyone has any suggestions on how to leave them without it killing them, please post away. If you somehow feel compeled to try and save me by telling me that I'm worth something and that it'll get better soon, don't bother posting."
1208,will it ever get better,"My boyfriend of 10 years dumped me two years ago. Since then I have done everything you are supposed to do to get over it but I just cant. I've gone to counselling, taken antidepressants, gone out with friends, started new hobbies and kept up with work but I feel as bad now as I ever did. like another poster I go to bed each night praying not to wake up. All I want is him back. Please give me some suggestions to help me cope. Thanks for reading."
1209,Depression hurts..don't wait like I did!,I just wanted to share this blog I wrote with everybody in this section who can relate! Hope it helps you =)
1210,Money.,I'm at my wits end. I'm losing hope completely.
1211,read this... hope this helps,"Hello everyone,"
1212,Whats the point of all of this,I feel suiciidal almost everyday and its been like this for 3 years or more. I probably would of been suicidal my whole life if i didnt live in my own world. That bubble is gone and im constantly stuck trying to deal with all these things in my life that i cant deal with. I cant talk about what is bothering me because its too painful. I then get stuck with people wanting me to explain things because i have this attitude because people cant help me. I really dont get what to do anymore. Either way i lose and im just stuck picking up the pieces. I dont even know why i havent killed myself but somehow i havent. I just keep on trying and just keep on falling into the same problem again.
1213,I wish I could fall asleep and never wake-up.,"Has anyone ever been in a postion were they think they are okay and nothing is bothering them but sometimes still think about sucide and want to go through with it ? But that something is always stopping you from doing it ? Sometimes, I wish I could fall asleep and never wake up again. I just dont want to wake up anymore. Wake up to what. I have nothing to look forward to when I wake up. Really dont. Sometimes, in the back of my mind I think that i'm better of being dead then alive and I dont even know why I'm here anymore when i'm better of being dead then still hanging around. Still dont understand the reason. Why am I still here. To a point I really dont care who I hurt and who I dont. I've been hurt to many times to care about who or who I dont hurt."
1214,scared..,"Lately, I've been having thoughts about suicide. This isn't just thoughts of anger or regular depression, but actual thoughts about killing myself."
1215,I want to kill myself - not because im unhappy,"Hi,"
1216,2 full bottles of sleeping pills,"I don't want to kill myself...but at the same time, I don't want to live anymore. I look at everyone around me and they have achieved so much in the last 15 years. Me? I'm back where I started...which is nowhere. Sure I went to school, got a 4 year degree, worked for a finance company.. yada yada...but now I'm back home with my parents, working for our small family business--a bakery shop...exactly the same thing I did 15 years ago! Nothing has changed....except I wasted alot of years... And then after many heart breaks...I thought I finally found ""the one""! I really felt like God was finally blessing me with a good man and a good relationship...We dated for almost 2 years...mostly good memories...and then he recently broke up with me and said that he doesn't see himself married to me. OUch! In my drunken state, I've always been tempted to swallow two full bottles of sleeping pills. But I'm so scared about where my spirit would go in the afterlife that I stop myself. Its funny cus I'm usually the ones to tell people NOT to commit suicide...but how can I help others when I cannot even help myself? I don't know what to do anymore. Death seems very enticing right now--"
1217,Trying,"2010 was to be the year of changes. I just recently graduated from college and the plan was to move to Washington. But horrible things keep happening and now I feel so lost and like I am not going to get where I want to be. I have so many things I have to deal with and I understand I've made some bad decisions and now I am paying the consequences. But why when I actually want to be a more positive person, a better member of society, does everything suddenly come back around to slap me in the face? It's like a never-ending vicious cycle and I don't know how to get past it all."
1218,I've thought about it sometimes...,"From time to time something bad happens and the thought crosses my mind... yes, I think that I've actually considered committing suicide. I doubt very much that I'd have the courage to go through with it but it scares me that these thoughts are in my head. Why am I thinking this way? Because a relationship didn't work out? Because some guy didn't like me the way that I liked him? I know these men aren't worth it... giving up my life. I know that I could never do it, yet I've thought about it... and it scares me."
1219,So sick of trying and gettin nowhere,"I dont know how i keep gettin to this point. I dont feel good about anything in my life. It seems like im supposed to just float around in nothingness because I cant somehow live a life thats enjoyable. Im just so sick of trying to make myself feel good when i feel like * * * * . Its like i have to put on a fake persona because my life is so bad that I cant live with it. I do nothing but somehow i always seem to just make it thru my really f-ed up life. I just want to scream, cry, and punch something so bad it kills me. I have so many demons eating away at me that its driving me nuts. I just hate that this is what my life has become and all im supposed to do is just accept it for being miserable."
1220,Life after suicide,"So, as I have written before I lost my sister to suicide in 2002. What a life changing event for those of us that survived her loss. Her children...adopted outside of our family, they changed not only their last names but their first names as well. At least they were kept together. It has been a long road of healing for me and Im sure for her children as well. They were very young (5yrs and 3 yrs old) when she took herself from us, but the adjustment for them was hard as well."
1222,Just another guy that writes about suicide I guess,"So this is my story.I am 18 years old,in highschool(I'm a guy),I always thought about suicide,and I still am.I haven't done it yet because I am afraid to kill myself,but from what I read on diferent forums,I saw people saying stuff like suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem,etc.Now here is why I believe that you are wrong(in some cases at least).I have been a fat kid all my life,not too fat,I mean I can still walk,run,and stuff like that.Just that I'm fat.When i was a litle boy I was bullied by others that made me lose all my self-confidence(not bullied like what you see in the movies,but since i am sensible by nature,I put it to my heart quicly).During high-school i wasnt bullied,but this doesnt mean that the others like me.I am just an outsider with no friends and no one likes me.Never had a gf,never had sex,hell,i cant even socialize properly."
1223,my wife is suicidal,"Hi,"
1224,I'm done,You experience lows that feel like you have actually kept going way past rock bottom. Then things get better for a while. But all the time you live in fear of the lows coming back. Then they do and you realise that the highs account fir such a tiny part of the whole that it could be the longest time before they come round again.
1225,so ready to say good bye,"its been months since ive thought about suicide, but the past couple weeks its all i can think about. im so ready to say good bye to this world. im not worth the fight to stick around, bleeding on a daily basis. i have a plan, just hope it works out this time..."
1226,"ugh, typical rant. i think it's time.",I am so fed up...
1227,any last suggestions,"first time here. been depressed over 30 years every day is hell. Last dec. tried co2 but failed. close but ended up with two surgerys to fix my arm. Only person really knows what happened is my wife. When i left to kill myself she was crying and said goodby but not once stop or dont do it. After second surgery i knew i had a couple of months to heal so i thought last chance to get help. would have no pressure from work or responsibiltys. At first could not find a therapyst. I have been to a few that did no good so i wanted a good one. Good ones are booked. I found one an hour away from home but it took two months to find her and get a time slot. I went to about six sessions. Because of the drive i could only go once a week so we did a hour and a half session. $300.00 a session money i do not have. She is good but a day or two after i would be right back were i started so each session was like starting over. The only way is twice a week. Now back at work and deep in dept from three months off of work i can not take off two days a week or even come close to paying over $400 a week plus the meds she says i need and the $200 a month for that doctor. I hate my job and the stress is bad and work is slow not making a living wage if it picks up the stress will double. Not the enviromnet to get over depression. A month ago i took a drive to the hills to kill myself, gun this time no more failed attempts, but i did not do it. I called the suicide hot line what a joke that was. Problem is i have a 12 year old daughter and i dont want to do this to her. We dont talk much havent for a while i isolate myself from them but i know it wont be good for her. I am at the point again were death is the lesser of two evils. I can not afford help and i can not do it on my own. This is my last effort for a different plan any advice? I am going to kill myself on tuesday"
1229,Please help me,Hi
1230,I dont see anything working for me,I just really hope the people that read this arent the type of people who think im just saying that without actually doing things to help myself. Im just so sick of being suicidal after all this time and it not gettin better. Im just a complainer and a loner and that doesnt help. I dont even like calling myself stuff like that but what else can i do. Ive done everything that you could possibly do to stop yourself from killing yourself and I still end up right here like its nothing. I cant help myself when i get like this so im supposed to get help from others but you cant depend on anyone. I really just dont get it because it makes no sense. Its like people around you are supposed to help you do good in life if thats what your trying to do but what if you dont have those type of people in your life. I dont even know if i would have anyone in my life right now as it is because its a f-ing mess.
1231,Please help,I think I'm going to kill myself tomorrow after work - everyone has given up on me and I can't keep living any longer.
1233,I want to end it tonight...,Life is just not worth living anymore.
1234,"I Would Like To Kill Myself, But......","O.K, I was raised Catholic and have been going to church sense I was 3-13 years old. I'm now 15."
1235,I have no hope,It seems like the only thing holding me together is being manic. I dont see anything in my life that would give me hope. I basically live only to deal with more pain over and over again. Its like im fighting myself to be positive and am losing really bad. I sometimes fantasize about killing myself just to get away from the pain because i wont do it. Its like how much worse is my life going to get. I constantly feel like a victim because even when im doing everything I can even if its alittle things dont work out for me. My life is constantly about things going wrong and having to deal with them. Of course I have no choice in things going wrong because im not in control of everything.
1236,Tired of fighting a losing battle,"Decided that I have had enough and will end it soon. Frustrated with always ending up at the same place - knee deep in crap and no way to get out. No matter what I do the depression and suicidal ideation always seems to hit. I have tried everything (therapy with and without meds, talking to friends, you name it) and no matter what I do I end up in the same place. I know that no one will miss me when I go. I am a wasted, used up excuse for a life. I am so tired of being torn in many directions and only being used for what I can do for the people in my life and not one of them wondering if they can do something for me. I am tired of living so that others won't be lonely. In my opinion that is a stupid reason for staying alive and in crippling pain. If my family truly loves me then they will be glad I am not in pain anymore. Right now I am so angry and frustrated. I wish I could end it tonight. But as soon as I get what I need then I am gone. I just need someone to talk to to keep me from killing them before I kill myself. Thanks"
1237,I Can't Stop Thinking About Doing It,"Months ago, when a long term friend and I finally began dating, I was convinced that he was the One. When our relationship began to take a turn for the worse, I secretly swore to myself that I'd end my life if it didn't work out."
1238,"Some advice please on love,suicide and depression","hey, i don't know if this is the right thread to talk about this but i need some help or opinions."

1240,My Mum keeps threatening suicide and making my life a misery,"Heya,"
1241,I am a ticking time bomb,"Hi,"
1242,I almost did it but...,"I was almost five minutes to the middle of the bridge....but I chickened out. I skipped school and told everyone bye forever yesterday, so why didn't I go through with it?"

This pain burns deep past a place I can't reach for help. I am a disgrace as a person and am taking up space. I want it to be over..."
1250,I have daily thoughts of suicide,"I left my job on a friends advice to go to another job. She is now an ex friend. I know it was my decision but she know at the time I was devistated because my ex put me out of our home then moved his ex in and his family. This girl was so by my side thru everything. The new job didnt work out I lost it. I was doing something I liked before and had perfect attendance. They will not rehire me because I left without notice. The big boss was considering it because I was a good worker but never got back with me. The h.r. person sent me a letter when I reapplied that they are going with more qualified applicants. Funny I was qualified enough to get the job. But I have tried to get back on my job. I know its my fault but what hurts so much is that the person who gave me the advice while I was down, depressed and couldnt deal with reality of my ex putting me out of our home after 7 years, she sat and gave me advice and know I was not in any position to be making any major decisions. Well I lost my job, became homeless and all she could say to me was, well you didnt want that job anyway. I told her I should not have taken her advice when I was in such a fragil state. All she could say is I dont know what your talking about. Its like she hated to see me getting ahead. She is the kind of person who wants someone to take care of her, I want to work. I was there for her to see her get back on her feet and get a place to stay, she told me if I was losing my place as long as I have family I have a place to stay, I didnt want to stay with her."
1251,Just looking for feedback thoughts...cant get away from it,"Hey great people,"
1252,"Beating self up, horrible day, horrible experience","I had had an ok day, but it really went down hill later on. I had a read through of a play tonight, and i was so tired going into to it."
1253,renewing my vow to kill self,"i always try to throw away the thoughts of suicide. managed so far. but things are keep getting worse and worse in relationship, career, financial. the guilty feeling of failed marriage and the regret of treating my ex so badly it's unforgivable. loneliness. and when i thought i have reach rock bottom and think that things will go upwards from there, i hit another low."

1257,I'm thinking about ending it...,and I have been for about 5 years. i've seeked help and at this point my pain is just embaressing...i have no one to turn to. life changes but it never gets better. i'd rather be dead than live this life. i don't know what to do.
1258,Goodbye,I am not going to take this anymore. Goodbye.
1259,"Remember, the pain is only temporary","Yes, it's been temporary for me for the last 8 years. 8 straight summers I have thought long and hard about killing myself. Each year, the regret builds that I didn't do it last year. Summers are the worst. This is when I'm at my lowest."
1260,Cutting ties with family and friends,Is cutting ties with family and friends a sign that someone is on the wrong path? that he or she is having suicidal feelings?
1263,Too much going on for me to deal with.,"I've posted on this site before, but not on this board. July 16th of last year my dad died and things have been downhill since then. By downhill I mean financially, emotionally, spiritually and everywhere in between. I live with my mom and my sister (I originally planned to move out last summer but was unable to do so because of my dad)."
1264,"voices, isolation, and emptiness.... I am insane aren't I?","I just cut myself for the first time in about two months. I have no idea what brought it on, and that's the scary part. Life for me, is just so surreal, so far away from me. It's almost as if I am watching myself 'live'. Kind of like an out of body experience...? And in the middle of all this numbness, out of absolutely nowhere, I will get this intense surge of anger and self hatred and disgust. And sometimes something will trigger it, sometimes it will be even the smallest things. Like I'll be on the phone and that person has to go, or I'll drop my pencil, or even having a knife in my sight... And sometimes It would be nothing at all. But then in an hour or so I'll be completely back to 'normal' and be thinking to my self ""where did that come from?"" And I cannot help but pay attention those feelings; they are so intense and killing myself and self injury seems so clearly defined and makes total sense and nothing can stop me... And when I'm in my 'regular' state of mind, Ill be thinking ""Life and the world and how everything somehow 'fits' together, it's just way too damn interesting to not be a part of it, or at least try figuring it out."""
1265,I want it to end.,I ruined my life and I can't forgive myself this time. So much at stake and I failed. I have nothing to live for.
1266,Suicide????Couple questions????,Do you think of suicide?
1267,The weekends are always the hardest...,"Because they give me a chance to comtemplate on how much my life sucks and how it's not getting any better. Yes, I am receiving help and I am on medication, but I just started so naturally it hasn't made me feel any different. Actually it makes me feel pathetic that I can't even help myself anymore and that I'm relying on some pill to make me feel less worse. I think of all these ways to try to make myself feel better, even faking happiness like I did before, but in the end I'm stuck being miserable. Everyone who I was once friends with real life and on the net has abandoned me at my lowest. I just want to die so badly, yet I can't seem to do it and I don't understand. There's no point in living anymore so why can't I just put myself out of my misery?"
1269,Does anyone in this world care?,"Hi anyone who cares,"
1270,To Anyone Reading,My best friend killed herself last night and I want anyone who is considering this to realize what it does to other people.
1271,Had enough,"Right now, I want to die. I have it all planned, so it looks like an accident, because I know that will be easier for my family.. no notes, no blame, just a tragic mistake."
1272,What's it matter?,"I sit here now considering suicide, but still knowing what I've been through is nowhere near as bad as what others have been through. But I've got guilt over...an unannounced trip that I took a while ago...all I want to do is die."
1273,I want it to end,"Last night, my girlfriend and I broke up. Its made me realize that I have been riding my happyness based off of others, particularly an SO. Tonight, I want my life to end. It is worthless to live like this and I have been unable to find happiness alone for 22 years, so why would that change now? I am thinking of endin my life tonight."
1274,the weight is becoming too much for me...,For the first time in a long time I am having serious thoughts of not wanting to live anymore.
1275,Am i just living deja vu every day,I feel like this all the time when im down like this. I dont even know how I can still be suicidal after so much time. I should just know better but my mind cant deal with what im going thru. Im supposed to believe things will get better but I dont see any of that. Im just dealing with the same problems that I cant deal with and they dont get better. I have no support system and its bugging me out because I cant even be close enough to someone to trust them like that. I just wish i could give up and just blame this messed up world for putting me for so much stuff that I cant even believe it. I know have to learn how to live with all these sick and twisted parts of my life that dont make any sense.
1276,"My life keeps gettin worse, Im so confused",I try so hard to keep finding things so i can at least keep trying to deal with stuff. Its just I dont know how much worse things can get to where i dont know if ill be able to keep dealing with it. I keep writing and trying to find ways to deal with stuff or at least give myself time to try to deal with it. Its just i have so many things I really cant deal with that somehow im supposed to be able to. I know what alot of people will say because ive heard it before but it doesnt seem to work for me.
1277,"i want to shoot myself in front of my dad, how messed up is that?",i've been thinking this a lot lately. i just want to buy a gun and do it in front of him. i want to tell him that it's all his fault for destroying my childhood. i want to tell him he was wrong and made these horrible mistakes with me. i love my dad but i also hate him. i hate myself.
1278,Please help me,"I really need someone to talk to..through messenger email whatever. I can't take being labled emo or aggresive or being told to ""go get a boyfriend"" anymore. I'm being pushed closer and closer to the edge and no one really cares nor understands me"
1279,Maybe I might be able to deal with this,Ive had a really long battle with depression all my life but for the past couple of years being suicidal is the biggest problem. I dont really know if ill ever feel like a normal person because ive gone to the lowest of lows in just how bad its been. I really felt like killing myself today which was hard because ive really been trying hard to fight what im going thru. Its just thats mainly because of how bad it was. I was having shakes last night and today. I had racing thoughts for about a week now or more because i really dont know.
1280,I am extremely likely to have a nervous breakdown but feel i will have to hide it,"Hello, I really feel I am extremely likely to have a nervous breakdown, but I feel I will have to hide it as the reason for it is something that"
1282,What is there left to fight for..?,WTH is there to fight for when everything is against you?
1283,Why is committing suicide often seen as a cowardly act?,First of all I've no intention of killing myself. Just thought I'd start this topic out of boredom.
1284,I need help.,"I am sixteen and am so emotionally wrecked I don't know what to do anymore. I have made so many mistakes in the short amount of time I have been alive. I would love to live till I was 90 but I just can't see my self happy. I have tried everything to change things around. It is sad to say that I truly only feel like everything is going to be okay when I am so far gone on drugs. I have turned to them recently and if it wasn't for them i would probably already be dead. But there effect of making me feel okay is going away. I just don't know what to do anymore. I have tried killing my self already once before not even six months ago and I got scared and called for help. I took over 250 pills that night, they said I was not even ten minutes away from death. But lately I have been regretting calling for help. I just want to leave this miserable place and be gone. I am sorry for people who believe in god who read this but I don't believe in him so I won't be going to hell. How can there be someone who is suppose to love us yet let us live with so much pain and suffering each and everyday. I just need some help. I don't know what to do anymore. My parents haven't exactly been here for me or anything, so I can't turn to people who have just been around be but never there for me. I want to die but I don't know if I can do it. I hate waking up every morning just knowing I have to walk around being fake. I am probably the fakest person alive. I walk around with a smile and act like I am the happiest person of the earth. If my friends and family would understand how I truly feel they would understand when I actually get the balls to tell someone about how I feel. help me please, what do I do?"
1286,Its funny,"How people think its immoral or unfair to kill yourself. I've finally come to terms with myself and understand that these are just beliefs instilled through social conditioning. For the first time, I am going to do what I think and feel is truly right. I'm not looking for replies to counter my opinion, I just wish more people would be more open and not go into every thread in here and post ""I'm sorry you feel this way, things will get better. But you have to be positive!"""
1287,There's Just No Reason,"I have no real friends, no real family. My patterns of behaviour are self destructive and hurtful to the others as well as me. I can't deal with emotional pain. I'm too depressed to work or function despite meds and therapy. I'm convinced that I'm losing my mind. I find myself staring at walls for hours for no reason before I snap out of things. I rarely eat and rarely drink anything except alcohol. Life seems futile and hurtful. I feel as if I died along time ago. I don't even know what happiness is. In childhood I was abused, in my early teenage years I was isolated (literally, I mean 0 social contact) and now I am nothing more than damaged goods. Nobody cares about me or knows me. My so-called friends have dumped me like a ton of bricks. I'm finished, it's over, zip, done, full stop, period, goodbye. My body will have to be scraped off of the train tracks with a shovel. I don't want this to happen, I want to live. But it's all too much. I don't care if things will get better anymore. It doesn't matter to me."
1288,I don't understand how people's words can push me to kill myself?,"Last night I was having an emotional break down because of an argument I had with someone. I posted this problem here and some comments just made me feel worse til the point where I had to call 2 suicide hotlines, which didn't work so I ended up calling my mom instead. Now its 11:30 am and I still feel kinda bad..I really need to a develope this ""I don't care about what you think of me"" attitude before it kills me..sorry I'm just ranting"
1289,My Story,"My story of depression follows a long string of events that I won't bore you with. But the bottom line, I am depressed, this much I know."
1290,I feel so alone,"i know this is going to sound so pathetic. but recently me and my boyfriend broke up.. he was my absolute everything, i spent everyday of my life with him for 7 months, he helped me through the bad times, he made me laugh, he completed me. now his not with me i feel so alone and worthless. i have big problems at home, my parents don't understand anything about me and i just have the biggest feeling of emptiness in my stomach and i have nobody i can talk too. i had a best friend who messed me up even more and ruined my life. i cant see a way out of this and the only way i can see is to just let go of my life.. my ex tells me he doesn't care if i died or what i do to myself and im an evil person. these things get into my head everyday and drive me insane and make me want to just end everything."
1291,Who am I?,"Do I exist? I'm not questioning whether or not I'm alive or real or what reality even is, but rather"
1292,Am I headed down a dangerous path??,"For months now, I haven't been able to sleep through the night. I'm constantly waking up over 15 times in only 4-5 hours. My mind is constantly running. It doesn't matter what I do that day, if I'm busy or relaxed; I just can't stay asleep. I've been married for almost 5 years now and lately I haven't felt the same about him like I did before. I know he's there and he tells me he loves me all the time but I don't FEEL it. Lately I feel like he is merely a roommate. When we have sex, I feel disconnected and sometimes like there isn't anything there."
1293,Headed down the wrong path,"I am not sure there is a way to salvage my life. While not actively suicidal, I did ask my friend for his gun last week. I told him that I needed one for self-protection. In his infinite wisdom, he saw through my ploy and told me he'd never be able to live with himself if I were to use it against myself. Still, I see me trying to get one someday and doing just that."
1294,final solution,living is agony yet the thought of death fills my retched soul with fear. death is not the solution. i wish to not exist.
1296,Some advice,"hi all,"
1297,motivation,"Cast out unto the world without direction, we look for a wind to guide us through life. For most, their sails give them the force to go through life. Sure, there may be adversities to overcome, but there is always a wind pushing them through life, giving them the motivation to look for hope in tomorrow. Their hopes to some day be a teacher, a parent, rich, or happy give them the enegy to push through the tides that try to push them back."
1298,The last 3 years up until now,I was looking to reach out and came upon this site.
1299,Waiting to kill myself,"I don't want to go through why, I've done that too many times before. Suffice to say I had many reasons, and few of which can be ""easily solved""."
1300,"My SO is having thoughts, please help!",My SO is having thoughts of suicide. I've been with them for 3 years off and on and i've known about these thoughts for most of them. I've tried my best to be there for them but lately it's getting out of hand.
1301,I just need someone to distract me for five hours or so.,"That is why I'm posting here. I'm in a legal situation where my Mom said she'd pay for a service for me, but after I got it done she stiffed the person."
1302,I had everything to live for-until yesterday,"Hi, I'm new to this forum and I'm really hoping I can find some support with what I'm going through."
1303,I feel as though I have no reason to live and every reason to die.,"It's difficult to explain the situation. But I have been depressed, I THINK I've been suicidal but I'm not sure. I can't give the reasons on here as I sent an e-mail to my dad explaining the reasons, it was over 20 pages long and even that was just the tip of the iceberg. Is there anything you can do to help me?"
1306,I Think i need help,"I await the day I die. I sometimes think about taking my car off the road to end it all. I have already had accidents, but have only injured myself. everyday, i think of other easier ways to die. I know its selfish, i know i shouldn't. but i have had enough. I try to speed the life process more and more by drinking and smoking excessively and taking any drug i can get my hands on. last time i was in one of those moods i heard that 30 panadol are possibly lethal. I took 47, not to mention the other tabs i got my hands on... antibiotics, pure codiene, anything that had something in it. I felt incredibly sick for weeks. And got me depressed that it didn't work. I try to help people with their problems, but no one seems to think about me. i feel worthless, useless, just a waste of skin. I don't want this life anymore. thankfully i believe in reincarnation. So death doesn't worry me. I'm scared i may do something drastic soon. I'm too stubborn to see a psychiatrist. I dont open up to anyone, as i just feel like i am weighing them down with my problems."
1307,"But, I am alone","What other way to start off this topic with, I hate my life. I'm worthless! Everything that could possibly go wrong happens to me. i have no best friends to turn to, my girlfriend just broke up with me today, i have nowhere to turn, nothing to look forward to. Every single day i think of ways to kill myself. or just an escape. ive starred at my car multiple times, wondering if i just drove off, and never came back.. what would happen. As i type this im starring at a full bottle of pills, and i'm holding myself by a thread from grabbing that bottle and trying to OD. Nothing goes right for me. ive been depressed for idk how long. im a paranoid person about everything, im jealous over everything, i hate all the painful crap i deal with day after day. there has never been a perfect day. I dont want to tell my mom i want to see a psychiatrist, because i know she'll flip and try and nurse me, which i dont want at all. Theres nobody that could help me. nobody that could drive me to a psychiatrist, nobody that could help. I don't believe in god. i don't believe in reincarnation, and thats another reason holding me from death. what will happen? is it just... black? a dark hole forever? do i just never think again? There has to be something."
1308,Why not,"I am thinking of ending my existence. Why do I say existence because what I have is not a life but just that. I have been unemployed since August have no money and even though I go and apply, send resumes, etc etc , I get nothing not even a call. I am 47 yrs old never been married still single after many failed relationships, with the last attempt of establishing one ending at the beginning of December. I feel flawed like nobody cares, my family appears to not give a * * * * as they all have jobs are married and well their lives are just grand. If I dont get a job within the month I will be on the streets, I have given up hope that will happen and have begun planning my demise. I just want to go to the mountains and sit by the most beautiful tree I can find and freeze to death with the beauty of nature being my last thing seen on this planet. I know people say think of all the people you will hurt. Well just once I would like them to see how I hurt and show a little compassion. It just seems like I am on the outside loking in and no one cares. I mean lets face it me leaving here wont leave a mark just as my life hasn't so whats the difference. I just don't trust anymore nor believe in what I see in this world, it is a selfish place and ruthless and I see no hope of that ever changing."
1309,<> panadol,"Here i am again, after consuming 45 panadol in an attemp to kill myself... i swore not to do it again. and i am now sitting here. and have consumed 10... thinking about pushing on and trying again. life is misserable at the moment, and i cant be bothered going on. What to do..."
1310,I tried last night and failed again...(may provoke strong feelings),"On the outside, I'm someone who has it all...a successful career, a place to live, food to eat, clothes to wear, a wife, a son..."
1311,Re: Paracetamol,
1312,I want to just give up :'(,More and more I'm thinking suicidal thoughts and I hate it Some of you may think it's a dumb reason but not being able to get an erection in bed with a hot girl is truly depressing I don't even know if going to see a doctor about this is going to help. I'm feeling very low as a man right now and I know that if I go see a doctor I'm not going to have any results for at least a month if not longer.
1313,Worrying behaviour,"I am having a very hard time at the moment. I know break ups happen everyday and people have to deal with them. But I have been very depressed for a long time leading up to it, and it has sent me over the edge. I broke up a long term relationship about 3 weeks ago. My dad is also very sick and underweight and gaunt with arthiritis, I am worried about him. I lost my grandma last year. I work in a very unfulfilling job. I have lost my confidence and self esteem. I am crying or on the verge of tears all day. I have lost touch with a lot of friends. I don't enjoy life anymore."
1314,setting a date to end it all...,so ive posted here before... ive got big problems and have been severely depressed for some time - probably about 10 years now
1315,Almost ended it all.,"Last night I tried to kill myself. Took a whole bottle of 0.25MG Alprazolam (got them prescribed to me about a week ago as antidepressants).... Eventually I just passed out on the floor. No memory of what happened leading up to this execpt for 4 empty bottles of beer and the empty bottle of pills. Woke up puking everywhere, feeling really dazed and out of it. From what I was reading about them, by all rights I should have slipped into a coma. I wish I had of, wouldn't be here right now...."
1316,Sometimes it feels like such a good solution...,"I've never actually attempted suicide, but as I get older and life gets harder, it's starting to feel like a good solution. I feel so alone more often than not. My heart is broken. I'm constantly worried about my future. My family doesn't help with anything, rather they make things worse. I feel like I have no real significance. Like nothing I do really matters. Nothing I say gets heard. It's just all so hard. I'm finding it harder to be happy. I feel like such a loser lately. I'm not satisfied with a single part of my life. Why be alive?"
1317,The drawbacks of being a social animal,"How long could most people live without friends in their life? seriously... a year... 3 years...5 years. All the while trying, just to constantly face indifference, rejection. I dont know whats wrong with me."
1318,I'm better off gone then living.,So I battled depression for about 5 1/2 years. I also had sucidal thoughts too and tried to attempt them so many times which leaded me to hospital stay's. I have been to therpy no therpy I go to ever works out for me. And sure dont make enough income to pay for every session. I tried support groups there no help either. I am now on medication for depression. Which I have been taking for about a month. I feel like I 'm better of gone then living and there is no reason on why I should live my life when it's going no where anymore.
1319,Wife constantly threatening suicide.,"Ok, not constantly maybe, but several times a year."
1320,Too late for hope,I read a lot of threads on that forum and could relate to many things people say.
1321,i need help again,"sorry i havent posted anything in a while, i got blackmailed into a drug rehab center for depression. which didnt work, i've been put on new meds that make me even more depressed but no one cares about that because they are supposed to make me better so therefore they do. (i know it doesnt make sense to me either)"
1322,im a lost mess,before i start i should say plz dont criticise me i will just get really angry and say something retarded.. excuse my spelling and stuff
1323,"I'm nearly broken, and hopeless","Help me, I just can't take my life anymore."
1324,feeling hopeless,I was abused as a child and witnessed a parent being abused. I've been in and out of therapy since I was a child. I unfortunately got involved with the wrong person and have a child with him. He continues to make things difficult for me even though we are no longer together. I decided to go back to school later on in life and he does childish things which makes it difficult to concentrate on studies. The courts do nothing and never believe my side of the story. So I continue to put up with his nonesense which continues to impair me and hold me back in life. He has proven that he is never going to change.
1326,wanna die,I WANNA KILL MYSELF LAST YEAR I MOVED DOWN HERE TO LIVE WITH MY AUNT I SAVED ENOUGH MONEY TO MOVE THEN SHE WAS ABOUT TO GET EVICTED SO I GAVE HER THE MONEY SO SHE WOULD BE OKAY NOW ITS A YEAR LATER AND SHE MOVED WITHOUT TELLING ME NOW IM HOMELESS I HAVE NO FAMILY AND THE FRIENDS I THOUGHT I HAD IGNORE MY CALLS NOW I REALLY WISH I COULD DIE BUT IM SCARED ???????????? ANY SUGGESTIONS SERIOUSLY IT HURTS SO ING BAD I DIDNT DO ANYTHING TO HER OR ANYONE ELSE
1327,I want to be done.,"I dont feel I belong here. I am a late bloomer in life and it took me so long to find love, and then I threw it away. I am a lazy person, with no ambition. Im not that smart, an education seems far off or impossible. I have no job. I might have to give up everything i have."
1328,I cant cope with my life,I really dont think there is anything anyone can tell me that I havent already heard or tried. I dont even like writing here anymore because ive gone thru this so many times already. I dont even know what exactly has been bothering me but these holidays have been the worst of my life. I remember how bad I was when pretty much my whole life went into ruins but alot of it was blocked out. It still was unbelievably painful but I really feel like things are worse now then they have ever been. I keep on feeling like im supposed to be doing so much better then I really am.
1330,"My name is Jake, and i am a coward.","I went through a pretty tough time at work quite recently and to cut a long story short i got diagnosed with PTSD. The problem is, i was hopeless before that even happened. One day, things got a little bit too much for me to handle so i waited until i went to the firing range (im in the Navy) and i stole a live round. My intention was to keep it until we got back to the armoury where i could get a weapon without supervision. I did not want to get my colleagues involved in this. I picked up my weapon, cycled the round into the chamber and put the muzzle in my mouth. I owe my life to the man who made me the godfather of his child. He found me crying into the barrel of a gun and took me away from all that."
1331,100 ills,"I ate a bottle last night. I went to the pharmacy, bought some pills and some ice cream, then said good night to the world. Yet, I'm here now. I want this to be over. I can't live like this. It's not fair. I wish I had the courage jump from a bridge, but I can't. I can never bring myself to climb over the rail. I don't like gun, but even if I did, I don't have one, so that's moot. I have slit my wrist multiple time. I have consumed obscene amounts of pills (I don't think I should say what I took, because I don't want to assist in a persons attempt.) Right now, I'm still pretty messed up from the pills. I just want ti to be over. I don't have anyone to turn to. I don't have anything to hope for. I hurt so much. SO MUCH! I don't have anyone. I HATE THIS!!! People die everyday from all sorts of things. Good people with great dreams and aspirations, so why do they die and I live? I don't ""appreciate"" life, so why do I have to live. I want so badly for someone to just end me. At this point, I'm really just thinking about how I can do this comfortably. I don't know. I want to try again, but my body aches so much from my latest attempt. My throat is dry and sore. My liver is in agony. I'm incredibly weak and have severe ataxia. Why do I have to live like this? Someone, anyone please help me."
1332,Morality of Suicide,"I have mixed ideas on the thought of suicide. What I mean is that I understand that commiting suicide affects more than just one person, but it influences the others around them. Now, if suicide is a personal choice why does it conjure such images of guilt, cowardice, selfishness or other negative conotations?"
1334,Im afraid of how much worse my life will get,"I always thought thru all of this that things would get better before they got so bad that I couldnt deal with them anymore. I can see now that isnt the case. Its like normally I wouldnt type any of this because my trust in people is pretty much ruined. Ive ever only trusted one person or thought I could trust that person and to have that person bascially throw you to the side like your nothing has left a scar so deep that i dont know if ill ever be able to do anything about it. I know my life was bad before but to see just how messed up its gotten, there are really no words to describe it. Its complete and utter hell that im still surprised im alive. I honestly have no idea why I havent killed myself yet. I guess i thought that somehow things would be different but instead its just the same miserable mess everyday."
1336,need help RIGHT NOW,"ok i think i need help ASAP. last weekend my brother was reported missing... that messed me up a bit but I've been hoping he's ok, I've been somwhat dealing well with it."
1337,My New Year's resolution is to kill myself,I recently posted about a friend of mine who committed suicide. I couldn't believe she'd done it. I couldn't fathom how someone could believe that ending their own life was really the only option to stopping their pain.
1338,My ex-boyfriend keeps threateneing suicide,"We split up a month ago - long distance. Went out for two and a half years. I really miss him but I think I've left more of a void in his life than he has in mine, I have support from friends etc. He keeps texting me things like 'I dont see the point in living anymore'. I try challenging it but he keeps implying he will. I have no idea what to do. I'm just trying to move on with my life but he really scares me."
1339,I could really use some help or advice pleasee,Hi So ive been reading threads on this forum for a few weeks now. I've been really depressed all through out 2009 and now in 2010 i think its beginning to wain a little but id like to share my story and get some advice.
1340,none,"many said that i ought to be thankful. but i dont see what is there in my life that i should be thankful for. i have no family, no friends, no intimate relationship, no career, no housing, lost my dreams, lost everything. then some said that i ought to be thankful that i am breathing. but i aint sure if i ought to be. some said i am being drama, some said i am dwelling in self pity. but i thought why cant a man grief with some support around. so would you call those valuable friends when you cant even count on them? i think no one wish to be down or in that difficult situation that they are in. sometimes bad things do happen to good people. but why is life so cruel to let it prolong? does anyone really deserve it?"
1341,Death wish,"I feel alone. I'm around people all the time, co-workers and friends, and they're all as great as I could ask for, but I feel alone. I've always felt alone, since I was a kid, and as I grew up I felt less and less the sense of joy and discovery that had made life as a child interesting. Now, nothing moves me but fear and restlessness, and it's exhausting, and isolating. I'm 25, in grad school, rosy future etc etc...it's all just the same bull * * * * , and it shouldn't be, because it's exactly what I thought I wanted. The truth is I don't actually want anything, but doing nothing was not an option, so I did this. Whatever. Same * * * * ."
1342,give me a reason,"if anyone can give me one single thing to live for that doesnt end up with me being unhappy or me making someone else unhappy i wont kill myself. pain from the item or action can be durring or after. for instance finding the love of my life, bad thing because in the end either we will get divorced or one of us will die. just gimme one thing. if anyone can come up with a single thing that does not cause pain i will keep living"
1343,If Someone's Life Never Changes For The Better...,"... Do they somehow, I don't how to word this... Do they have the right to kill themselves and not have people crictisize him/her harshly after it happens?"
1345,Everyday just gets worse ..,Hello there. I believe I have posted here once before ...
1346,i'm doomed,"I wish I was someone with coping skills, but I have none. I wish I was a stronger person and didn't get so crippled by life's tragedies but I am not. I am who I am and deal with things in a very destructive manner. I do not expect you to understand nor should anyone. I am highly aware of what I am doing but cannot stop it. There is something terribly wrong with me and I cannot figure out what it is, but it never stops. I am scared, scared for my well being and safety. I truly wish I had all the tools to live a normal life but I simply cannot. I feel like an old dog who cannot learn any tricks, my mind won't let me. I probably sound like a crazy person right now and thats how I feel. I hate my life, I hate everything about it. I am blank, empty and down right depressed, i'll never learn, i'm a sick person."
1347,Lowest point in my life,"I've officially hit the lowest point in my life. I am constantly googling suicide on my phone whereas before I was googling how to get someone back. I am a student and my state of mind and mental health are affecting it big time. I could easily be getting 90's however I am just simply doing enough to get by. I dont know where to turn these days as my friends are the most judgemental people on the earth and any sign of emotion being showed is a sign of weakness, females and males. I am in a whirlwind of financial trouble and in total need about 10,000 dollars to get me on my feet again. I try to tell myself to be good at everything I do, including school and that will make me more attractive to her but everyday I dont hear from her I get very discouraged and just add everything together and realize its not worth living my life anymore. I have been going to the gym, and remain seeing friends but its just emptiness everywhere I go. If there were a pill that killed me instantly I would take it. Its just suicide is so hard to do, I just know my body would fight it and I dont feel like putting my body through that. I just can't take the emotional pain and numbness and knowing I lost the girl of my dreams. I have been considering asking her out again as the communication lines are open mostly due to my efforts and I plan to Friday. If I get a response that hurts, im not sure what I am going to do to myself. The easiest method I have come accross is hanging myself. I appreciate everyone who provides support to people like myself and others. I just feel so empty sometimes no matter where I go, I can barely watch TV and I cry everyday. It has just been a downward spiral since the girl of my dreams I was seeing for 4 months left me in June. I feel so low in my life right now that I feel and fear I am too deep to even try to get better and back on track and feel suicide is the only option because I cannot feel like this any longer. I refuse to."
1348,Life worth living?,"I understand that i live a decent life. i have parents (though they are separated and my dad is an ass) i have a roof over my head and food on the table. i do have issues like every other people relating to friends, school, family, work. I believe that these issues are not the reason for my mental issues. in the past o tried to commit suicide and was depressed but not diagnosed. i learned that over the counter pain killers does not work. i got out of that phase. as of september it came back but worse i have panic attacks and my depression is taking a bigger toll on my life. im not trying in school. im just getting by. im losing friends. i cant sleep at most 2 hours. i started getting little glitches and i wouldnt know what i was doing and finally with one of those glitches i tried to kill myself and ended up in the hospital. now i am seeing a shrink. i know i havnt seen him much but it isint working the meds are suppose to take time but i feel i dont have time. the anti anxiety meds are suppose to work right away and i still get really bad attacks. my life is decent i know but i want to die so bad i dont know if i can hold on. please dont tell me about jesus i am catholic i tried and i cant. i need out of this world i dont see the point you die in the end anyway so why not speed it up. im writing this to distracting myself from plotting a way to commit suicide. i dont know what to do anymore. is there any advice please and thank you"
1349,May have lost someone.,I'm posting this as I feel I need to write down how I feel about this.
1350,Thinking of ending my life,I won't type a lengthy post because you can read my story on this thread:
1351,I found out today my sister tried to kill herself,"Today my mother told me that about 2 months ago my older sister (31) tried to kill herself. she told me that she locked herself in the garage alone and turned on the car trying to kill herself twice. it didnt work, and noone knew about it until her counseler called my mother and told her. i dont know why my mom told me, im only 19. my brother was murdered about 6 years ago and i cant bear the thought of losing my sister, id have noone left. i mean i know i would have my mom and dad, but id be the only sibling left. my mother told me not to tell ANYONE. but i figured here i could remain annonymous and still vent. i dont know what to do. i want to tell someone, i want to protect her and tell her i love her, but i dont know what to do. i tease her a lot but now i just want to stay home and make sure she doesnt do anything. my mom said shes working on it with her, but i mean around the time my sister tried it she seemed really happy, and thats what scares me the most. i want to talk to my psychology professor about it but i dont know what to do. do i tell someone? should i make her go to a psych ward? please help me"
1352,Suicide Addiction: A real disease?,"I was reading a newspaper the other day and I saw an article about possible ""suicide addiction"". Basically it said that people who had tried to commit suicide many times ended up addicted to the feelings of almost dying and then having people feel sorry for them and giving them attention, etc etc."
1353,I don't feel so well..,It's three o clock in the morning.. I can't describe in words how depressed I am right now.. If I could just go away without hurting myself I would be truly grateful.. Alot of things are a mess in my life right now.. And I feel so pathetic.. lonely and worthless.. Empty.. I'm sick of my life..
1355,i dont know how much logner i can keep living like this,hi.
1356,A different experience,"I've read so many expressions of suicidal thought, here and elsewhere, and have yet to find anyone who seems to share my experience with thoughts of ending life. In each instance, the suffer expresses (overtly or by obvious impression) the need to end his or her life as an escape from pain. Suffering, whether physical, emotional, or spiritual seems to produce in them an active drive to seek refuge from that pain by the extreme and desperate step of suicide. This is not my experience."
1357,I'm so tired of being crapped on,"Call me retarded or something but the one semi decent present I got for christmas was a game. Everybody is my family decided they should all play it and when I go downstairs asking why somebody didn't ask or tell me, they get up on me and my mom says ""you need to stop it!"" and then I am like ""OK then just take the game back with you because it obviously isn't mine"""
1358,Is there something wrong with me?,"Hi, My name is Kathy and I'm 16 years old."
1360,Empty. Dead. and lonely.,"My life is crashing down all around me and there's nothing I can do to stop it. My dad has heard nothing of my last suicide attempt a few months ago, he didn't even know I was suicidal, and I would have liked to keep it that way. But last wednesday, my boyfriend broke up with me, my great uncle died, and my grades went way down. And on top of that, I just started at a new school, my parents are in the middle of a custody battle over me and there constantly fighting."
1361,My mind is falling apart...,I'm falling apart. My mind has moved from the person I was to the person who wishes the world would cease killing him.
1362,why live if i cant ever be happy,"long story sort, july 25 my life completely turned upside down, my wife left me. im 24 years old married for 3 years and never imagined posting in a suicide thread. this was complete shock what she did, we had prob but who doesnt, couple of months prior i also lost my job from making 25 bucks an hour to zero, living a good life to nothing, anyway my wife wants nothing to do with me and i have literly lost everything, i moved in with a cousin and i have nothing, im here because iv been very depressed and for the first time ever im having suicide thoughts, i dont think i can get lower then i am right now and i cant get up. i really want to die because i lost the most important person in my life, and i know nothing will bring me back to being happy so i dont really see any reason to live, but i wonder and its the only reason i havent done it yet, maby she will come back. the other day i tried to cut myself never done it before and was afraid and stoped. i guess my ? is how does someone who has truly hit rock bottom bounce back into life, and find a reason to live i dont have a penny to my name i have debt of thousands no car no job no friends, because i put my wife first and couldnt make any but now look at me. i guess im really looking for someone who might have been through something like this with some advice."
1363,contemplating...cant take it anymore,"im so confused with life everythings so complex it makes me crazy.why does life have to be so hard? im so lost. i have no guidance and im giving up on my goals. i dont ever really know what to say on here or how to explain what i wanna say. i just feel like a lost soul that no one cares about. i feel like im losing my mind. i hate myself and my life. the pain is too much to take anymore. why does it have to be like this. all i have are bad memories from the past , so many times ive been hurt, treated like a outcast, and abused. all i can think about is how messed up my life is, and how messed up my family is. ,my dad left when i was 8 and my mom never took care of us i had to raise myself.so its no wonder im so messed up. i cant count on anyone for anything. it hurts being this lonely, why do i have to suffer like this. i wish i had the courage to end it all. i dont belong here or anywhere. no one will ever care anyway."
1364,I want to die,"I wish I could die. I pray that Jesus will take me from this earth right now. PLease remove me. My whole 30 years here was a waste of time. I was abused to the extreme and I am still helpless and suffering abuse right now. So many things in my life happened that were not even my own doing...things I couldn't control. I hate the people with the good lives who have the nerve to tell me, ""You're an adult now. You can control your own destiny"" and all those lies. I used to believe the lies too. I used to coldly tell people ""Oh, just do something about it?"" But what can I reasonably do? WHAT CAN I *reasonably* DO?"
1365,depressed and alone,"i have so many problems right now i feel like everyone around me is normal and i feel so crazy. like theres so many things runnin through my head and its driving me crazy cuz im goin through so much and i need to talk to someone really bad but i feel like no one would understand .i wana tell sumone but im too embarrassed to talk about it. and it sux i hate my life right. everythings just so bad. i dont wanna live anymore i want help and im never gunna get it. i dont even know why i come on here it doesnt help anything i just feel even worse. i cant take it anymore i feel lost and nobody cares. everythings just so hard , i dont wanna do it anymore"
1366,numb,"I’m so lost and confused. My life feels like a chore that I’m tired of doing. I’m forcing my self to live even though I hate it. I feel hopeless and abandon. I don’t understand most humans the (shallow, selfish, conceited) kind. And I don’t like being in there presence, it makes me feel ill. So I’m always alone, always."
1367,Suicidal,"Well, almost. I'm so damned depressed today. All I want to do is bury myself in a bottle. I just don't have the energy for anything at the moment. I haven't been to work these past two days. Slept almost the entire day. All of my life is gone. How do I find the energy to go on."
1368,"I'm looking for something on the interent, not sure if it exists or not","I'm looking for a quiz you can take online where you answer a survey about yourself (or someone you know), and it gives an evaluation if the person is at suicide risk or not."
1370,Light at the end of the tunnel,Eckhart Tolle’s Story
1372,help me,i have been seriously contemplating suicide.....I am getting closer and closer to not finding a reason not to. I really need someone to talk to....
1373,"One of these days, I will find the courage to end it",Life just seems like nothing but a burden. Very little reward in return for a lot of embarrassment. I'm just nowhere near as good as I need to be for life to be worth it. 26 years old with no friends left and never had a date in my life. Never will. With each day I move farther out of touch with society.
1374,Meh... Depressed,"I'll try and keep it short. I'm not necessarily suicidal just, well... depressed."
1375,"Perfect Life, Bad Decision","Six months ago I had a perfect life. An awesome wife, a great baby boy."
1376,Tired and weary...,"I'm posting here mainly because I want an outlet where I can rant. I've just been thinking of suicide so often recently. I'm just tired of this life. What's the point? I don't enjoy life, so isn't death a better option than a life of drudgery? I basically have no social life, no social skills, nothing to live for, nothing to look forward to, nothing that would motivate me to live another day. Having to post this on an anonymous forum means that I have no one I can talk to about this. And I know that most of you can relate, having no one at all in your life who you could trust enough to talk to about things like this. I go to college far away from home, and this loneliness that I'm feeling just won't go away. I'm already a junior in college, but I honestly I can count the number of ""friends"" I have on one hand. I feel little to no interest in my coursework, and feeling so often interferes heavily with my grades. I feel like a failure, like I'm not smart enough, like I don't belong here, or anywhere for that matter. Every morning I dread having to get up and face the world alone, following the same routine day after day, and knowing that life will just be a series of pointless motions. I want it to get better, but sometimes, I feel like I would be more useful buried under the ground. Having said all of this though, I honestly don't think I can go through with suicide. I fantasize about it a lot, though, wondering how pleasant it would be to just be done with this all. I've never been in a relationship, I know I can never find anyone, I have no friends, no motivation, I'm unlikeable, I'm a failure, etc. I know I should probably go to university counseling or something, but that would probably make me feel like more of a failure...."
1377,one month to live,"I originally submitted my story back in the spring. Although it took some time, I eventually became better and little more myself. But then in September things took a turn for the worse once again. I'll keep this brief and to the point. I lost my job(fired to be more precise) and as a result, in some sense I lost my friends as well. I've applied everywhere, every place of business within a reasonable distance and, as you can guess with the economy in it's current state, have had no luck."
1378,Suggestion: Can we allow suicidal people to express themselves?,"I was just wondering, would it be possible to relax the censorship rules for the SUICIDE section and allow posters to fully express themselves as they reach out for help? It seems so unnatural to read what people are feeling through the red asterisks or their modified verbiage to comply with the posting guidelines. Do we really expect suicidal people to express themselves as follows:"
1379,is he coping well? :(,Background: 8 days ago my FIL committed suicide in a very violent and painful manner.
1380,my story,Where to begin.
1381,its easier and more practical,"so... i'm having a few issues right now. for quite a few years i have been severely depressed. and i mean suicidal depression. but i've never killed myself, as evidenced by me writing this. i tried once while i was in a mental institution but they stopped and then abused me. now... up until about 3 weeks ago i thought that my life was just horrible and crappy and that was the reason for my depression. it made sense and had good evidence to support it. so i have been in therapy for a good 7 or 8 years now.. and it hasnt worked. and i just found out why. my problem isnt that i have had a horrible life, well maybe it has a little to do with that, but now i am believing that it is because of a biological problem. now i've tried antidepressants before and none of them have worked. but about 4 months ago i started smoking marijuana because i was on the verge of killing myself because i hated life and i figured i had nothing to lose and everything to gain. so i tried it, and things got better. and i dont just mean a little better while i was high. i mean my depression was completely gone, my schizophrenic symptoms disappeared, i stopped fighting with my mother, and life was great. i stopped smoking for about 6 days and when my system cleaned out from the high levels of thc, my depression came back just like before and i wanted to die again because life was horrible. thats why i believe it is biological. so now that i'm an addict, i see what is happening and i know i need to stop. the problem with stopping is that i will want to kill myself. therapy isnt working so thats not an option for keeping me safe if i quit. so i've run my options down to a couple of things..."
1382,I am having 'stupid' thoughts tonight :(,"Argh i feel so * * * * , home alone - i tell you its the evenings that will be the end of me with barely any friends or family"
1383,"I'm just to afraid, I'm just too pained.","Every day I have thoughts of suicide because my life is already falling down around me at 15. I've had these thoughts since I can't remember when, and I'd like to kill myself, because honestly, if some ass blows himself away then the world is that much less crowded, and it really doesn't matter. But the problem is that I'm terrified of the afterlife, because of the fact that if there is no heaven or hell, you basically just stop thinking, so everything you live for is meaningless."
1384,If I,"If I live, I disappoint."
1385,feeling really bad,"I'm feeling bad lately, suicide is something I think about a lot but I doubt I'll ever do it. having a really hard time acting happy...I feel like my friends are going to give up on me any day now and not want to be around me because of it, I'm not really sure why I have friends and why they like me in the first place. I know they will all be married soon and I will be left alone anyway. I do have good family and they would do a lot for me, but I've always pushed them away and wanted to get away from them since I was born and dont know why. they remind me of myself and make me hate myself even more I think. since my last girlfriend 4-5 years ago, I don't think any girl has liked me more than in a friendly way and I'm 27 now. about a year ago I started taking some pain killers, stopped going out, since then I stopped taking them and only like going to strip clubs to see girls without the reality of rejection, the looks that a girl can give when she wants nothing to do with you just kills so much. looking in the mirror really hurts and I just wish I wasnt me anymore. I dont want to live but I dont want to die, I'm just living and going through motions and I dont know why. I think theres a possibility of hope for me if I work on myself and become a confident person like I have been for short times in my past. I don't know if I can get there before I get worse and hate myself even more and cant get out"
1386,I missed out on everything...and it makes me want to give up...,"Well, I'm 19, and I know I can't let the past rule my life, but...I had a few good things happen in High School, but not many."
1387,my story,Please let me know what you think...
1388,ruined things with my bf want to commit suicide,im 21. havent posted anything about this guy.
1389,I hate feeling this way...,"I hate feeling so down and lonely all the time. I'm in college, and I can't focus on my work. I feel so worthless, stupid, and unloved. I have nobody here I can trust, and I feel like life just isn't worth living. But I hate myself for thinking these thoughts. I should be grateful for what I have (even though it's not a lot). I'm always thinking about how it's better to die than to live. Why live when life is just drudgery and misery anyways. It got so bad last night that I took a bunch of sleeping pills with alcohol. I mean, it certainly wasn't enough to do any real harm, but I slept for more than 12 hours, and right now I'm feeling really sluggish, but I'll be fine. If it wouldn't cause so much pain for my family, I would probably choose to be dead...I hate feeling this way."
1392,"I think I'm suicidal, but I'm not sure.",Hello ENA:
1393,how screwed up am i,the way i see it a little anon advice might be what i need
1394,There is No God,"The reason intelligent design is not scientific is because there is no evidence for it whatsoever. You see - in science we don't begin with conclusion and thereafter try to search for evidence to support those conclusions. Rather, we begin by observing the world and performing experiments. Only then do we pose hypotheses based on those observations or experiments. After conclusions are reached, the rest of the scientific community actively tries to disprove those conclusions, rather than reinforce them. When faced with a question we cannot answer, there is no generic fill-in-the-blank response such as ""God did it."""
1395,help please!,"im depressed and suicidal. i cant take it anymore. im seriously about to end it. i know i dont want to, but i cant fight these thoughts anymore. all i can think about anymore is killing myself. i cut to make the feelings weaken but theyre still there. i dont know what to do anymore. i have a plan, please talk me out of it!"
1396,To whom it won't concern:,Hello everyone. Prepare for a wall of text that most won't read.
1397,my thoughts,"I have just gotten over my last attempt. 67 staples later I am still here. Why? I cannot see the need for me and now I feel like a disaster. I try playing golf getting out but that only helps for a small amount of time. Doctors say there is nothing wrong with me and that I am a sensible person. Well this may be the case in their world but that is certainly not mine. After having a look around the net all i could find is support. That in its self is a problem but when you or I as it is in this case just want to talk about it with the ultimate conclusion that this will happen there is nobody that can say anything. Nobody talks about it really and this drives me crazy. Public liability dictates that you cannot do this so where is the support so many people need. I understand that there are some of you who have thought about it and changed your mind and that's cool good for you, however there are people out here that will continue until it is done and all that i am saying well this is my choice and not anyone else's. The laws of the land change all the time. In some cultures its a part of their customs in others its against the law and in some its a sin, but what is more wrong failing to do it or just have a drink get depressed and drive. Society expects but i dont i do my bit but really im just killing time. To all of you out there with those thoughts seek advice honestly it will help, you dont want to try and fail and end up parilised."
1398,"Should I call the police, his parents or a suicide hotline?","It's not the first time I'm posting here about this, and I'm at the same point I was back where I wrote here about it."
1400,i need help,"today i went to see my guidance counselor about my depression/suicidal feelings. I just cant talk about this with my parents, it's complicated. So, anyway, i go there and she acted like it was some kind of joke. It was just ridiculous, and then after less than three minutes SHE CALLS MY MOM even after i asked her not to. I mean, i can understand if we talked it out or something but no.. i walk in and she tells my parents. And she couldent have taken the situation any ligheter, the first think she says to my mom when she walks in is ""so Michael and i have been talking and he says hes pregnant ha ha ha just kidding..."". Hahah isn't that funny? doesn't the fact that i want to kill myself make you want to laugh? ugh so yea she tells my mom who of course blames herself, and now i feel terrible... All i wanted was to be normal like everybody else, i though it would be as simple as talking to the guidance counselor, and then we could work something out but... idk, what should i do?"
1401,I want to kill myself right now... tonight...,"It happens on and off though. Me wanting to kill myself I mean, It has been this way since someone who I was deeply in love with and who I really thought was my soulmate broke up with me. Not after fighting or anything like that but after he fell out off love with me one day. I dunno how either!! He dosent either!! We were in love and he kept telling me he wanted to marry me one day and everything, But then he just fell out off love! I never even believed in soulmates till I met him. I feel so bad right now, bad enough to kill myself."
1404,"Life, mine, the world is gone","Growing up i was a really dreamy spacey kid, lived inside my thoughts and had a great imagination, it carries over today with my different perspective on things, usually not thinking like most people around me aabout life love meaning in general. Anyway I know i am getting older and i know im changing, I once saw the daily steps i took as leading me to a great path, a great life, a great love, a great career, ive always thought my realistic fantasies would come true if i wanted it enough. I feel like thats all slipping away."
1405,I've hoped and waited long enough...,"Well if you did bother wasting your time by clicking this link,I guess I'll start out by saying I'm a college sophmore, I have no friends, no money at all, I literally have a car with no gas sitting in the parking lot. I hate going to class or doing anything anymore, I find it hard to get out of bed most days because all my classes are so boring and hard and I know each and every day I have nothing else to look forward to but to repeat the boring hungry day again because I'm a poor ugly loser... I can't find any reason right now why I should still be alive, I don't impact anyone's life in any way, I hardly exist. I smoked so much weed the year before coming to college that I swear I'm partially retarded from it still. All my old friends, which weren't that many, have moved away and are basically gone, I find it hard to get to know anyone new because I'm so boring and I hate everything, and I mean EVERYTHING. I hate TV, it's all propaganda and stupid stereotypes and the same boring things over and over. I hate the winter where I live its 8 months long, I hate churches because all they do is brainwash you, I hate people in general because they will absolutely destroy you and backstab you to the fullest extent they can just to gain ANYTHING from it. I have been nice to everyone around me, maybe too nice, I try to go out and do things and make new friends, but it's never a success. I'm convinced I look ugly or weird or something because nobody seems to want anything to do with me ever. I am too depressed to move anymore I barely ate anything or got out of bed saturday-monday, not even sure if I really want to go to class tomorrow. I'm flat out bored of life, everything people do has such a predictable outcome it seems like, nothing is enjoyable or exciting or fun or anything anymore."
1406,i think i'm going crazy,hi
1408,I'm living a nightmare,I really can't take this. I couldn't work in office. I was depressed the whole day. And in the evening i was totally anxious.
1409,I need help but things are complicated,I really just dont see that im able to do the things that im supposed to do for help. I really tried to deal with this on my own because ive always had to do things like that but this is impossible. I really feel like if i was able to do the things that i was supposed to do for help I would of been able to do them but i havent. I cant even try to explain the type of things my mind is going thru with all the internal conflicts and the back and forth of being self-destructive and trying to help myself. Its just so hard to deal with the things going wrong in my life when Im really just overwhelmed all the time by everything. Ive gone thru so much and really havent seen that many people go thru anything even close to what ive gone thru and it not really changed everything in their life and left them pretty much defeated and bitter. I have way more worse issues then just that but if i can really say that in one day my life totally changed it has and its been so crazy to deal with.
1410,Life constellation..,"I'm sitting in front of my computer right now with my guitar, listening to In Flames - Gyroscope, amazing song, over and over again inside my own world of emotions.. you know what I mean.. trying to play the dam masterpiece, and I finally got it now.."
1411,I tried and failed one year ago today,"My life has only gotten worse. The only difference is that I don't have that same courage. Yesterday I tried emailing one of my closest friends, telling them I needed to see them. I received no reply. I called that suicide hot line tonight and found myself on hold. That's actually the second time I've called and the second time I found myself on hold. I'm on my third day of not eating. I lack the fortitude for a more proactive method, so I'm shooting for death by degrees. Maybe, the hunger will motivate me to do something more immediate. I just want things to not be this way any longer. I want it to end. I did everything they said to try to get better. Medication, therapy, hospitalization, all measures of life changes and attempts to move forward. I'm now 26, living on my mother's sofa. I have no job. No degree. No girlfriend. No possibilities. No hope. A year ago, I had most of those things and hope for those I lacked, but I saw the fall coming and tried to get out before it came. No I live in the nightmare I tried to avoid. The one everyone said I was mistaken about. I realize now, that no one will ever say, ""You're right. Your life is hopeless and death is the best thing for you."" It'll never be said. I couldn't ever imagine saying it myself, even if someone told me my life's story as though it were there own. We have to decide about self-deliverance on our own."
1412,I don't know where to turn.,"I do not know where to turn anymore, life is just full of empty motions, devoid of anything worth while. I do not offer anything to the world all I do is bring everyone around me down. I have no friends. No connection with my family. (I have a physical connection, but no mental) I find myself in a vacuous state all the time. Most of the time I am unsure of my own emotions. And my one true passion; music, is starting to disinterest me. All of it is beginning to sound the same. I have no talents, I am anti-social, and there is unquestionably no one who will ever even begin to understand me. Including myself. If I were to kill myself, no one would really miss me. They'd probably grieve the appropriate amount of time that is expected, and go back to their normal mindless daily routine. The only thing holding me back is the unknown. Where will I go when I die? As I do not believe in religion (it only creates another reason for war) or god ( a myth made up for man to understand what they cannot) I cannot be completely sure of anything. But where ever it is, it has to be better than this. I just don't know how much longer I can take pretending nothing is wrong. I don't know how much more I can take pretending I actually give a damn about anything. But the truth is; I'm scared. And as much as I don't want to live, I don't want to make a wrong decision and screw myself over. But Im sick of not caring, I'm sick of people, I'm sick of society, I'm sick of life and most of all; I'm sick of myself. I wish I didn't feel like this all the time. I wish I could lead my life like everyone else my age. I wish I were shallow. And I think suicide is the only thing to take my pain away. People tell me I should, so why not? I'm just a burden to everyone around me anyways. It's not worth all the trouble of trying. I'm just going to end it. Please do not feel like you need to respond. I'm not worth your time. Goodbye."
1413,I dont know how you live like this,Ive spent the whole day being so angry that I cant deal with anything. I cant really do anything because all my issues ruin everything. Its just most of the time Im so mad at how everything is that in the end it doesnt matter. I know i cant do anything besides just deal with it because nothing makes this better. Im living a life to survive and thats it. I cant get any joy or feel good about anything because something happens and just ruins it. Its like just me talking about my life is depressing so people just because of that wont say anything. Its like all these dead ends that dont lead anywhere. Im supposed to live my life and just deal with whatever happens but how do you do that when your life is unbearable.
1414,im gonna end it,"i cant handle it anymore. im so depressed. im suicidal. i cut just about every day, sometimes more than once a day. i just want to say goodbye. im not worth fighting for. i dont know what happiness is anymore. i dont know if i ever knew what it was...someone help me please. i dont know what to do anymore."
1415,what can i do,My h's father just died. It was violent and self inflicted.
1416,is it okay now?,"So i have been contemplating suicide for quiet a while now, maybe for a year or more. The only thing holding me back were a few things that i regret and thought i had to make right again."
1417,I want to commit suicide.,"I've wanted to commit suicide for 3 years now, I just don't have the guts to deal with the physical pain. I always hope I die in my sleep when I go to bed, I'm just really sick of how the world works. It's like my fate is decided that I'm going to school until 18 then working until 65 only to look back at my unfufilled life and rot away. I only have two ways of getting rid of these thoughts, being distracted at school and smoking marijuana."
1418,Stevie Wonder,"I was listening to some Stevie Wonder music. I love his music. His music has so much personality, feeling, and happyness. He was blind from birth almost. It makes me sad to think about that. He's such a wonderful musician and I'm sure he's a great guy too, but he's blind. I wish so much that he could have the ability to see all the beauty in the world. Then I realized he sees beauty. He creates beauty. He was dealt crappy cards, and he still has such soul and life. For those of you cnsidering ending your life, reconsider. Life is worth living. Even if you've been blinded to the beauty in the world, you can create beauty. You can feel the beauty. If a problem feels unbearable, if you can't deal with it, then don't. Run away. Find a happy lace and live your life there. ind a way to be happy. Find someone to comfort you. There are many people here. I'm here. I care. Trust me. Live. Connect with someone, something, anything. There are worse places to be, and there are better places. Go to a better place. Listen to some Stevie Wonder. Think about what I've said."
1419,I'm already dead inside. Whats the difference?,"I feel so empty. I'm past the point of depression. im at the point where i just dont care about anything anymore.Not about my friends, family nothing. They've all F***ed me over at some point or another. I dont know what its like to be happy. Since i was 11 years old i battled suicidal idealation. What i had to go through growing up is something no one should have to go through. Molestation, Losing family members to drugs and booze. The abandoment. Ive struggled with Self-mulilation for god knows how long. I have nothing left. no more energy to deal anything else. i cant. and i wont. ive had enough. i thought i had found one person who understood me. and thats over now too. hes now sleeping with the person who i thought was my best friend, after him and i were together for 2 and a half years. But no. No one gets me. My thought process is far from normal. Bipolar since i was 16. in and out of the mental hospital. And just recently was released for attempted suicide by OD. I cant trust anyone. i cant open up to anyone. the one person i cared about now says no one will miss me when im 6 feet in the ground. and it would have been better if i had never been born. All my hopes and dreams will mean nothing to the maggots and worms eating away at my cold dead flesh. I just cant do it anymore. Everytime i trust someone i am let down . The F*** me over in the long run. I have a wall built inside my head that no one will ever get through. I bottle things up so long that i end up exploding and hacking a chunk of skin out of my leg or arm. just to feel something. i just recently talked to my friend pat, and i think he understands to an extent which is why he knows and accepts that i will take my own life someday. whether its today or in 10 years. im sick of gving myself to people. and letting them in so they can hurt me. thats all ive ever known was let down and hurt. My whole family knows what ive had to battle with. they dont understand, but i do know they expect me to crack one of these days and take myself out of this god forsaken earth we live on. It should be my right to take my own life. everyone says, ""oh its selfish"" isnt it more selfish of someone trying to stop me and making me endure the pain, suffering and torment that i have to go through every day of my pathetic miniscule and worthless life? They dont have the memories, they dont have the emotional instability... they dont know what its like to walk in my shoes. no one should anyway. its torment. when you arent welcome in your familys homes, and you have a dead end job. you cant hold one for your life, it drives you insane. maybe its not enough self discipkine or maybe its the lack of concern for your well being. whatever. ill just overdose on sleeping pills and call it a life."
1420,Thoughts,"I've always thought of suicide as an option. I don't believe in heaven and hell so there's no problem there. i figure if there is an afterlife, i am screwed to begin with so why live?"
1421,schools gettin me down,I suppose I will begin by offering a bit of background information.
1423,I feel so alone......,"Ive tried so hard to get over this depression...my girlfriend and I broke up on the 22nd, I havent been able to eat, I even spent 2 days in the hospital because of it."
1424,at what point am i actually going to do it?,"I've posted in this forum before, if you search my username you will find it"
1425,Damned if I do...Damned if I don't...,"First of all I'd like to say that I've read posts on here and that a lot of you have great things to say regarding this subject. Thank you for your thoughts, as I can see them definitely helping some people out there. I've been battling major depression for at least 10 years now, maybe longer. And though I can see the value of what some of you have to say, I have a hard time applying it to my specific situation. I realize I would be hurting people by choosing to remove myself from this planet. One thing that I'm trying to make sense of though, is when I should stop caring. These same people I would be affecting have played a large role in why I feel the way I feel. I seem to be a complete failure, no matter what I attempt. I don't believe my existence benefits society for any reason at all. I have come to the conclusion that the world has passed me by and will just keep on going. I do not feel like I can relate to anyone, yet I still try, with a small shred of hope, to make a connection(such as starting this thread). I've been alive for about 1/3rd of my lifespan and I am sick to death of how things go on. It seems to me that hurtful things happen to good people without much rhyme or reason to explain them. It seems like royal a**h***s have the best of luck at anything they do. Is this purely an issue of confidence? I think not. I believe it's more of an issue of greed and selfishness. Am I being selfish for believing I don't belong here? I don't think so. I've looked at the problem rather logically: 1.I am a burden of one type or another on a lot of people. 2. I don't like it here. 3. With a lot of patience, medications, and talk over the years, I have come to the same conclusion, based upon a lack of being able to find a suitable compromise. Was I just born to be the world's doormat? Am I not allowed to make mistakes, but must absolutely and immediately be understanding of others' mistakes? As I mentioned before, there is still that shred of hope that I can figure all of this out. But for now, it is as my thread title says, I feel like I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't."
1426,11 years,"After 11 years of wanting to commit suicide but knowing id hurt someone, but that someone i assume gone. can i do it? i would love to. others would get over it. it's never a big deal."
1427,I'll kill myself - damn lonely,"I think I will end my torments. Permanently. But I think there needs to be some explanation. Some do it because they broke up with someone, others do it because they are laughed at, some after loss of loved one or out of loneliness... But none of those reasons fit in with me. If someone was to laugh at me I'd probably rip out his intestines and feed them to him. I'm 6'2'' with 220 pounds of muscles. But not fat by any account. I'm not lonely either. I'm a dancer and as such have met scores of other people, most of which call me their friend. I don't drink or smoke or do drugs. My friends love me and I'm extremely successful in most things I do. Why would I then want to kill myself you ask? Because of love... Or more precisely lack of it. For as long as I remember I wanted one thing, and one thing only. A girlfriend who would love me. Who I would be happy with. And I never got it. I would give world for such a girl. She would be secure in every way. Physical, emotional, economical... But nothing helps... Every time I grew fond of some girl she would tell me that she only wants us to be friends. Nothing more. I heard that one so many times that I lost count. Not to say that I didn't have girlfriends... I did. A lot. But... It was because I felt a duty not to hurt or disappoint any girl that liked me. I even tried liking them... But to no avail... Once I was in love with this girl and was trying to win her over for like 4 months. She told me she just wanted to be friends... It was two years ago and she's still my friend. I'm to loyal for my own good. Does any one of you know how hard it is to be friend to someone you love and see them with other people and KNOW that you will never have that person? Dreadful feeling. Wouldn't recommend it. And so... I decided to give up. I can't take it anymore. I don't have any hope or strength left to cope with this. I'm sick of always watching couples enjoying themselves... I'm going to take some pills and jump of the roof of company HQ. 'tis only twelve stories..."
1428,help....each day is driving me crazy,"I've become so depressed i cant even walk with my head up. I've lost everything.....my girl, my career is in the dumps,my health is down, and i hardy have any friends. I've had a history of social anxiety, depression and now i think i'm paranoid too bcz I don't see any future for myself. Everyday its the same thing, dread about the future, absolutely terrified about the future. I dont have that 'safe' feeling...not even at home. I keep thinking to myself..God take me away....There have been too many traumatic situations in life which have made me like this and i don't know any way out of this."
1429,I thought love was suposed to be beautiful. Help...anyone?,"My best friend, who's the only thing I care about in the world, said she was in love with me recently, and it felt better than anything I've ever felt, but 3 days ago she took it back, and now she's in love with someone else, it feels like I'm being consumed from the inside out, I can't take it anymore. Can anyone tell me what pills will kill me the fastest?"
1430,On considering suicde-and considering others,"We are told that if we are consdiering suicide, we should take into account the feelings of those we might leave behind. This is reasonable, but it ignores the fact that there are people, like myself, who don't have anyone-no family,no friends, absolutely no one. I don't know why loneliness and being unwanted has been the curse of my life, but it has. It's just a horrible fact of life. Since I have no one who cares about me, does that mean that my suicide is more ""justified"". I am probably going to kill myself before the end of this year anyway; but if I had a ton of family and friends, why would my suicide be ""more wrong""?"
1431,What keeps you going ?,"As a teacher, I know that my kids need positive experience at school. Even if they don't perform well, it's very important to feel a supporting hand, someone that acknowledge their potential. You have to give positive feedback in order to keep the kids motivated. People, especially kids, tend to ignore the aspects of their personality where they perform badly."
1432,I'm fascinated by suicide and I want to know what it's like...,"I am not unhappy, at all. I have a lot of friends and nothing in my life is going wrong at all. I simply am just fascinated by the fact that someone has the choice to take their own life, to hold that in their own hands. A kid I knew, not well, I only met him a few times... killed himself about 2 years ago. He had tons of friends, there wasn't a person that didn't like him, he was a software engineering major at a huge school. I don't know why he killed himself or even if there was a note, but something about that situation makes me think he knew something. Or that he just knew that life needed to go on without him. I've been thinking about suicide a lot lately and even though I don't think I have the courage, yes, I said courage, to kill myself, mainly because I couldn't even bare to think about what it would do to my family and friends, I wish I could. I just need to know what happens and what it's like. I feel like if I ever get the oppurtunity to have a gun in my hands, I could think about doing it. Is there something wrong with me? It's kind of scary how much it fascinates me. I'm sure there have to be other people out there that is fascinated by it. And I'm sorry if I've offended anyone with depression related suicidal thoughts."
1433,i don't know what to do anymore...,"well, where to begin. ever since i was little i never really felt happy with myself. I always thought of myself as, ugly, stupid, and just incapable of fitting in with other people. I feel very lonely a lot, don't get me wrong, i have friends but i don't feel very close to any of them."
1434,sounds bad,but i want to end my life but im scared of doing it alone. i know they say if you want to end it you dont get scared and think about the pain etc im 100% sure i want to end mine but feel as though i need someone to go threw this with me
1435,Feeling very depressed and even suicidal... I'm serious.,Hi everyone.
1436,Suicide.. Forgotten the next night,i just keep thinking.. and thinking.. and thinking about suicide.
1437,My ex is having suicidal thoughts....,"This morning I woke up to 17 twitter updates from my ex. He was talking crazy, not making much sense. He is bi-polar. I have known him 18 years and we started dating last summer, but things ended in early June. I guess I should state that things ended during a manic episode that he was having and he cut me out of his life. That was the second time since we started dating that he did that. I have recently been hearing from him again..just casual chit chat and when I read the twitter updates this morning, I became concerned about him. I texted him early this morning and asked if he was alright. He said ""No."". I asked if he wanted to talk about it and he said ""No. Its insanity"". So I told him that I would listen if he changed his mind and that he could talk to me anytime. His reply was ""Too drunk. Gonna die in the next 9 months. No order. Only chaos"". He then went on to say that he was at the point that if there was no more him, then there was no more. He was fine with death now. I know he has attempted suicide in the past, most recently in 2005 and he said in his twitter update that he was feeling like he did in 2005. I don't know what to do or what to say. I don't know any of his family and any of his friends that I know are far too shallow and narcissistic to even care. His last text to me said ""Me tomorrow = drinks. Today c mean"". I'm not even sure what he is trying to say there and he will no longer answer me. ](*,)"
1438,I can't do this anymore,"The last year of my life has been hell..... The love of my life cheated on me with his ex, my job has fallen apart, and people who I thought were my friends are cutting me out."
1439,I gotta a gun...It's scaring me...,I recently just got back from training with the military. Im now a civilian armed security guard. I own a gun and I am now scaring myself. I get so depressed and I feel sooo alone all the time even when Im with other people. Dating doesn't help cause when the guy stops calling I think somethings wrong with me. I don't like being alone...Ive called suicide hotlines many times. One time when I got really close....Im just tired of feeling like this..
1440,7,I was 7 years old when i wrote my first suicide note. My mother found it and gave me a whack. No one understood.
1441,Is there a point to all this? Really?,I want to die
1442,I still don't get it!,"I still don't understand why i can't get control of my life. Emotions keep affecting my choices i make and its scares me. On the other hand i make it a priority to be a logical person to a T on the surface! I do a good job and keeps my work intact and friends to an extent...on the other hand im very emotional introspectively and emotional with my family and close relationships. Im troubled with my self image and as a result struggle with close relationships and my family. I try ignore that side of me and just get by day to day but i eventually come back to looking at myself and its ugly. I end up depressed and anxious and extreme paranoia! The paranoia is what scares me! This is may seem ridiculous but i become paranoid of getting sick or disease especially lethal or STD's Ive practiced safe sex and been tested partner or two ago. The logical step is to test all the time as it may not show up first couple. But regardless of logical answer for that emotionally i feel dead. I guess i should be alone in that regard if i fear. On flip side cancer could happen to anyone scares me. Im sorry to write this if anyone thinks im overreacting but my emotions are acting irrational and i dont know how much longer i can resist! With suicide so common seems like its not entirely bad to rule it out logically speaking. I understand that it may be the only way to correct this situation. My life isnt entirely bad though just my emotions i don't get it! My family shoots me down everytime i try to talk to them because they look at me at being myself or weak. Doctor looks at me like a disease or a drug. Friends have no opinion or don't realize i think they have there own business. The world might look at me like a statistic thats scary. Almighty looks at me as a defect in creation. Im sorry this is long but im must be thorough; im 28 and seems as i get older as a guy i get more ugly too ive put on 40 pounds last 4 years, yes i work out. Im not very domesticated. Im was engaged couple years ago but didn't work out and im single to this date, i feel the quality of dating will decrease with age as my body keeps attacking my vanity. I drink alot when im down and continue to smoke off and on. I invest on the stock market which has its swings. I don't feel a typical suicide. just a balancing scale between my torn emotions and my plush logic. I need to nap in that marble orchard soon enough because this equation is too much for me to continue further please please understand!!!!"
1443,Just so you know...,I wanted to offer some words of hope...
1444,My boyfriend blame me for his suicidal thoughts,"He always blame me for everything, like it's always my fault that he wants to kill himself. I never do as he asks and he will always get in a mood where he would rather be dead then alive because I make him feel like s__t like he say."
1445,I hate living.,"Life sucks. The people that call themseves my ""friends"" are selfish stupid people. No one understands me. I'm alone and no matter how hard I try I can never seem to do things right. I just want to be done with it all. I am scared and need someone to talk me through this please..."
1446,First Time Here...,"Hi,"
1447,I want to jump from a bridge,Hi
1448,What to do,"Were do I start well back in thanksgiving '05 my wife called me up and said a friend needed a place to stay for a couple weeks so I said ok well january '06 she left me for him not only did I take him in but he was a heroin addict. I moved on got a new girlfriend and my wife did all she could to ruin it and she did not only that my brother was sleeping with my girlfriend and this wasn't the first time he did this to me after time went on in '08 I ended up in a mental hospital cause of my wife. Well I agreed to work it out with my wife and in january '09 our house burned down she then informed me she wasn't happy and wanted out I tryed to talk her out of it but she made up her mind. in feb of this year i lost got laid off march lost my second job april lost the place i was staying at moved in with my brother, may had my money stolen from my brother-in-law june my brother lost his place moved in with the only person i could the same person who took my money 2 days later on july 2nd he stole my car and wrecked it while smoking crack and all he got was a 6 month sentence for it and over this weekend I just found out my wife left me again for another man who is locked up pretty much i found out she was whoring around on me and while we were together in '08 she was still talking to the heroin addict trynig to make plans to be with him again. I can't find a job have no money and am left all alone I mentally and physically can't stand my life anymore i want to end it what do I do there is no hope in sight"
1449,Is suicide a reasonable option for me?,"I'm a 16 year old male, and my mom is an evil vindictive witch. I haven't seen my dad since I was a baby, but she got re-married to my stepdad, and now she hates me and wants to move on with her life and her new family. And please, please DON'T say I'm overreacting, because she even says that and it's plainly obvious if you observed our house for more than an hour. It's obvious to me now that natural maternal love is a lie, she tossed me aside like I was garbage ever since I was 14. She buys food for herself and her husband but buys me nothing. She tells me to drink tap water while her and her husband drink coffee and soda and smoke cigarettes and eat take out food. She doesn't give me money for a haircut or school supplies. The only way I can get these things is by selling my old video games and I'm almost out of the money I got from that. I'm wearing old clothes and everyone at school makes fun of me for it, so I have no friends. If I ask her for a drink or clothes she'll tell me to f*** off and hit me, and then when I defend myself against her she calls the cops and they take her side and act like I'm the bad guy. She told me she doesn't care if I died and couldn't wait until she could kick me out so that she would never have to see my face again unless it was in the obituaries page. And when I tell other family members about her she lies to them and they all tell me that I'm overreacting or lying. She's a really terrible person."
1450,whats left,"well here it goes, i am only 21 but my 21 years of living have been utterly hell and i cant deal with it anymore. I am normaly a positive person but life has taken that from me to. I have no job no money no family soon no home cant get a job because i got into a fight with a kid in school and his dad was a cop.Because of him i have lost my licence i have over 5k in fines, the car dealer i bought my car from shafted me and now i am paying money i dont have on a car that doesnt work. I have nobody and everytime i try to better myself but it just seems everyone gets there rocks off on smashing everyone elses hopes and dreams. this is my last option before its over. and dont say er. its because of people like me who cant handle all there problems is why it takes 10 hrs to get seen and is the reason that helthcare goes up. I am not going to cost other people money for my failed problems. i just dont know what else to do besides end it."
1451,Attempted Suicide,The mother of one of my best friends tried to commit suicide. She got rip-roaringly intoxicated and took a bottle of pain medication. Left a note. I don't know how to talk to him about it. I've never once been suicidal and have no idea how to handle this situation with him.
1452,Break up with Girlfriend - No point in being here,Ok well basically I have been in a relationship for a while with my g/f who I see everyday and have done since we started dating. We were deeply in love and thoroughly enjoyed spending as much time as we could with one another. However recently I did the worst thing you can do and cheated on her sexually. Yes I know it was my fault and I am not blaming anyone but I felt peer pressure made me do this - as I was with a stronger minded person who kept insisting me and this female indulged in sexual acitives.
1453,Really scared of whats to come.,"Hi,"
1454,Contemplating Yet Again...,So... I don't even know where to start here.
1455,Maybe my best option,"I am at a extremely low point right now. I'm sure alot of you know who I am but my ex left me 3 months ago, still lives with me, and spends the weekends with her new boyfriend. She said I drove her nuts with my indecisiveness, I bored her, sex wasn't playful enough for her, but I still want to be with her. And she has told me numerous times that living with me was an ""experiement"" and she still isn't entirely convivnced that I'm the one, she is too young, and needs to date around more, but we co uld definitely get back together again in the future as she thinks I might be a better fit for her in the long term. I have begged though and acted like such an idiot that I can tell she is closer to the other guy now and it's very painful to watch. I have nowhere to go. This has driven me crazy because when I look at her I just want to be with her and make things the way they were before. She was so good to me before and I g uess I took her for granted."
1456,What am I supposed to do...,when I start thinking about doing it?
1457,I've never felt this way.,"I have a hole. Its like something I have never felt before. Its constantly eating away at me. Waking up is a dread, I constantly think about the worse things in the world when I wake up. I feel like I can't handle this anymore. I can't handle the constant thoughts that my boyfriend is cheating on me, I can't handle that my parents can't accept my homosexuality, I can't handle the constant voice in my head that keeps me from doing the things I want. Its like my body wants me to stay this way. I don't know how to handle this anymore."
1458,"If the belt hadn't broken, he'd be dead.","Last night I heard some crashing around in my 17 year old brother's bedroom. He has always been troubled, for as long as I can remember. The problems run the gammit, from behavioral problems in middle school to running with the wrong crowd as a freshman to wildnerness camp for substance abuse as a Junior."
1460,I don't know why I exist. I'm better off dead.,This economy has hurt me in so many ways in my personal life and a bunch of that pain stems from childhood.
1461,I don't want this pain anymore,I'm not really suicidal but I know I get feelings that I don't want to be here anymore. The pain has just gotten too great for me to deal with any longer. I have an ex-wife who put me through hell fighting for my rights to my children. This was 6 1/2 years ago and she still torments me to this day. I won my equal rights to my children (ages 13 and 10) so I get them every other week.
1462,every day is the same,I just want you 2 give me an advice........I was born just because my mom wanted a sister for her daughter.....no one wanted me then.....when I was 7...my father left me my sister and my mother...and he go....i don.t know where.....before that every night he came home drunk and yell at my mom.....When he left my mother found out that he mortgaged the house....we don.t afford to pay it...so the state took our apartament....we rent one room ....we where moving all the time.....rent was half of my mother's salary.....when i turned 13 we moved at mom.s sister....in the other town.....until then...my life was quiet but being a kid I wasn.t really realize.....what was going on....anyway....i thought that here we will have a new start....other life.....but...I was wrong.....I never could adapt town ...at
1463,Need advice,"Hi everyone. Thanks for taking the time to read. I'm writing because I would like some advice. Well first of all, I have suicidal thoughts a lot lately, and I'm the type of person that few if anyone would ever expect to since Im positive, uplifting, forgiving, and smile a lot. The reason I've seriously given it some thought is because something is wrong with me physically. I experience a great deal of pain on a daily basis and when I am around people I totally suck it up. I've been to countless numbers of doctors (both general practitioners and specialists) and all they ever say is that my chart shows that I have some of the best health that they've ever seen but they wouldn't think of saying that if we could trade bodies even fir a second. You're probably wondering what kinda illness? Well I don't know as o haven't been given any diagnosis but the beat way yo describe is that I have all of the major symptoms of diabetes except I'm unable to have relief. This started back around 4 yrs ago. I am extremely thirsty, when I drink I have to immediately urinate, now I feel hot on the inside as if I'm burning up, and my skin is progressively drying out. Then although I'm naturally confident it's gotten to me because I don't look or feel like the person I used to be. My skin used to be perfect...smooth and radiant, with glowing white eyes and guns (bicep muscles) that would turn heads but now it's all faded. I know that we're not really the body and that it's merely a vehicle in this life/physical reality though i'm going through this and the main thing that bothers me is that no one can find anything wrong. I tested negative to diabetes 6 times and also diabetes insipidus (DI) twice. Although I tested negative for DI twice the doctor thought it was ok for me to try the desmopressen, so I tried for a year and it did absolutely nothing for me. All I know is that I have some type of water wasting disorder going on and because of it I rarely ever sweat, have body aches, muscle tics, dry skin, serious pressure sensation in my head, and an unquenchable thirst. The only time I feel is is directly after waking up and maybe directly before sleep. Waking up to this feeling everyday is a nightmare. I love life and respect people that focus on living and helping others and anyone that is genuine for that matter... I'm still do young and I really always wanted to have a familybif my own. There's even a young lady that I know that wants yo marry me but I can't get involved with someone with me being like this. Btw this all started after a car accident whereby an old man in his 80's ran a red light and smacked the mess outta my car whereby I spun around several times. I thought I was fine as there was no apparent exterior damage yo my body but boyyyyy was I wrong. The next thing you know I became extremely agitated and stressed out so when I got home I took this liquid mineral drink called"
1464,The Easy Way Out,I don't understand how people can say that suicide is the easy way out... I mean... I feel like its the most toughest thoughts I ever have... I feel like I'm being ripped apart every single day more and more... I thought I knew myself...I have a conscious mind of how I am as a person.. And yet... suicidal thoughts bring comfort to me to imagine myself dead...but then they also cause me so much pain... apart from the pain I already feel about life and living... Like I've said before... I'm most likely not going to... I just don't understand how people can say that its the easy way out...when I feel like its the hardest....
1465,I give up...I can't do it,I never thought it would come down to me feeling like this. But it has. I need help. Nobody will give it to me. I don't even want to talk about why. But I need something.
1466,Sorry about the lengthy rant : P :,"I'm not sure where to start, so I suppose I will begin from the time I was admitted."
1467,"""Crying on the inside, bleeding on the out,""","I cannot deal with this insane lonliness. I have literly no friends and im not exaturating. they all ditched me cause im suicidal and switching schools. I hate authority and society so much i cant even explain it. like wat it the point 2 it all? im just so sick of it all. Ive got an aduly mind trapped inside the body of a child and i hate it. No one takes me seriously, my parents and grandparents wont get the f*** out of my business. I wish they'd f*** off and leave me alone. and as for cutting im gunna do iyt anyways wheather they take away my knives and sharp objects or dont let me close doors or take me 2 a shrink or whatever. and im gunna do watever the h3** i want 2 anyways so why even waste their time on me? im worthless im not worth their energy. and god i hate society so much."
1468,Have any of you tought about organ donation?,"Hey so i was thinking, here i am i hate my life i cant stand it anymore, yet im perfectly healthy (except my head i guess) and there are people out there who would do anything to live a little longer yet they cant, cause they have an illness or organ damage."
1469,The time is getting closer... 4-5 months to go,"Well its getting closer to the holiday season, and at least I know I will not have to deal with this life anymore. Got a couple of good ideas to end my life. Only one of them would have to be done during the summer."
1470,No social life,"Hello,"
1472,Sick Of Feeling Up and Down.,"I'm sick of feeling up and down, in and out, and just plain crazy. I'm sick how one minute I want to seriously kill myself, and now that I ate something, I feel okay. I'm sick of it- It's like my emotions and thoughts can't stay in one place. I just went to my psychiatrist tonight and I was crying and everything. Thoughts about how hard these last several months were, how cruel people can be, how I never felt like I fit in anywhere in my life... just all came crashing down and it made me burst into tears."
1473,I think it's time....,"I'm so tired of my life. I just want to end everything. I haven't had a girlfriend in years. I haven't had sex in in eight. Yes, eight years. I feel so pathetic. I'm so lonely. It's really made me hate women, even though I know it's not their fault. I wish I could go back in time ten years and tell my fourteen year old self what my life is going to be like and hope him/me has the balls to kill himself."
1474,Cuts,I look down at my smooth wrists
1475,Just need to vent dont mind me,"Hello, first time here, i just need to vent before i do it and clear my head you dont have to read all this lol."
1476,Success Doesn't Fix It,"My little sister was diagnosed with depression a few years back, and since then I've been trying to help her cope with this new reality. One of the things that frustrated her the most was that she could feel better no matter what she did or accomplished. I began to explain to her one of the sad realities I had to learn, and that's that success isn't a quick fix for depression. She's been making tremendous strides in her life, and achieving things she always dream of. She completed her degree. She got a modeling contract with Ford. She's been traveling all over the world, but the depression still haunts her, despite the fact that she feels she should be happy. I remember how hard it was to have that conversation with her, because it's definitely one of those things that can easily make you lose hope. I mean, if you can't be happy even when you succeed, then why live? This is such a difficult way to ""live."" I remember growing up and learning it on my own. No matter how well I did in school, or anything I accomplished I still had this hole. IN the past year, I've been hospitalized 2 twice for failed attempts, and I've had two secret failures. I'm beginning to see success in music and I'm moving toward things that other people dream, but I'm not happy at all. That makes me feel worse, because I know there are so many people who are fighting to get where I am, yet I don't seem to appreciate it the way I should. I want this to be over so badly. I hate when people say, ""Killing yourself is easy if you"
1477,I just don't know anymore!,So a couple weeks ago I tried to jump off a bridge. The police were called on me and they got there just in time. They arrested me and took me to a place called Oaklawn on suicide watch. I hated being there so I lied my butt off to get out of there. So after getting out and going to see a therepist I found out I'm bipolar and they put me on some anti-depressents but i never take them because I'm an idiot. After finding out I was bipolar I got really depressed because I knew that whatever chance I had of getting into the Marines was gone. Then a couple days ago my roommates in the appartment I live in got in a huge fight and I got kicked out. So for about two days I was homeless and I had to have two people with me at all times so I couldn't try to kill myself. Now they let me move back in but everyone keeps fighting all the time and I can't leave because I have nowhere to go. I can't take this anymore! I'm gonna kill myself but this time in a way that won't draw attention to me until after I'm already dead.
1478,"i have no other choice, im done, i give up","whats the use of anything anymore, whats the use of even coming on here. its not gunna fix anything. i hate living i want out of this world. im just a boring person with nothing to offer anybody. im just a waste of everyones time. a loser with no job , no life. i cant take this pain anymore. whats the point of getting up every day just to live out a boring * * * * ty day then get up the next morning and do it again and again. i dont have any close friends anymore there all gone. im a recovering drug addict and i have bipolar, and depression, so im basically screwed up bad. theres no joy no fun, nothing and nobody. i dont even no who i am but i know i hate myself, and im sure everyone hates me 2. i want to be dead. i wish i ws never brought into this world. sometimes i wish someone would juss crash into my car and kill me, or someone would just shoot me. maybe suicide by cop. either way i cant take it anymore. nobody ever cares till its too late."
1479,End to failure,"I arrived at this site because of feelings i am having, and found individuals here with similar problems, however not to detract from their issues i thought I'd just start a new thread. I cant tell people how afraid i am of people i know finding me so to keep it brief: i was a star student who throughout high school saw myself develop into the class clown. I got one of the best high school diplomas in Europe giving me access to pretty much every University I could want to go to (depending on my subject choice) and did so without studying at all."
1480,The last note,"I don't know if i could write a suicide note. What would i say? Why would i pour my heart out? No one seems to listen to me while i'm here and alive. Go figure they MIGHT listen after i'm dead, but what good does that do for me?? I'm dead."
1481,The Price on my Ticket,"$59,000. That's how much I have to come up with before I can punch my ticket. Why? It'll pay off my student loans and cover funeral costs. My father is a cosigner on my loans and if anything happens to me he gets stuck with the entire bill. I don't want to stick my family with any expenses after I'm gone. Frankly if I could find a bank that would hand me $59,000 without a cosigner based on my credit rating no matter the interest rate I would be gone sooner than later."
1482,I just can't keep going,"Up until two years ago... my family was very wealthy, I was very talkative and funny, I would have every girl behind me and every guy wanting to be my friend. They all did what I said, everyone loved me, I was the teacher's favorite always, the parents loved me. I found a lot of great friends that were very much like me... I could have asked for nothing more. Now I'm 16; two years ago my family's business went bankrupt, we all lost everything, for two years I was kind of okay I still had my friends, money and friends has been the only thing I cared about for my entire life. Every day that passed I became less attractive for some reason, I lost confidence in myself, I discovered I was gay, I don't know what happened but I just wasn't funny anymore, suddenly I had nothing interesting to talk about, and so I didn't anymore. I moved away with no money or emotional strength to make new friends. I kept holding on to my past and not making as many friends here. Now it has come to a point that my old friends grew up and are no longer there, my new friends aren't good enough, and I am lost in a living hell. I've been in love like four times with some of my good friends here and right now I am really into my friend Albert. I can't take this loneliness anymore, I don't have many friends, my family was never close and I have no money. I don't want to live anymore I just want to disappear."
1483,i think its over for me,I have been depressed or sad about my life for as long as I can remember. Rarely can I think of an extended period of time when I was happy or even content with my life. I cant seem to make friends or even worse cant find love. I cant even find a girl that will like me enough to give me a chance. I am constantly having my heart broken. Each time I want to believe it will be different. But I always end up hurt. I don’t know what to do or what is wrong with me. There are many nights I wish I wouldn’t wake up. I have now been on antidepressants but dont think they are working. The only friend I have only ever wants to go out and get drunk and talk * * * * . And he doesn’t care who he goes with. Its doesn’t matter if its me there or someone else or no one else. I need more than that in my life. I feel like I cant relate with my family. I don’t feel close to my parents which is probably my fault for trying to distant myself always. I know they love me and care about me but I don’t know how to love back. I don’t know what to do anymore. I want to die. Have for a long time. But I am too scared that I will fail at even that too. The other reason is that I want to at least once in my life feel like I am or was a success. I want to feel like what I have done has been good enough. I want to make a difference. But I don’t think it will happen. I don’t have much but what I do have can be split between my brother and sister. Im tired of people thinking im lame. Im tired of sleepless nights. I tired of rejection. Im tired of being alone. Too many nights I have looked at a bottle of pills with a bottle of vodka in my hand and just thinking tonights the night I do it. I cant live like this. I have tried sleeping pills to help and they don’t seem to work. I have tried natural remedies for depression and they don’t work. Now I am trying modern medicine and it doesn’t seem to work. I go days without eating. It just hurts inside so bad. I want to disappear. I want it to be over. I need to end this now.
1484,I cant take it anymore,"i so badly wanna just kill myself right now. im never gunna amount to nuthin. im tired of workin so hard just to survive. i have no money, i have nothing and im going nowhere. i dont care about nothing anymore. i hate everyone and everything in this whole king world. F it all. i wanna be dead. i wanna scream and im so pissed right now. im gunna end up doing something stupid or messing up eventually its inevitable. i cant take it anymore"
1485,I am no longer looking for help.,Seriously why should I? To get told there is no one who can help me? Or my problems are too much for their service?
1486,"It Just Never Gets Better, Does It...",Long rant.
1487,Contemplating,"I can't take it anymore. I've led what most people would probably consider a good life, but I always feel like I'm missing something. My parents get along with each other and don't abuse or neglect me, and we don't have any financial problems. I never got into drugs and I've always been a good student. I graduated high school as a member of NHS with a 3.7 GPA and scored a 33 on the ACT. All the classes I took were Honors or AP and I scored 4s and 5s on all my AP exams. I was an Eagle Scout by the time I was 16. I've been at Michigan State University for two years and I've been earning good grades despite having an extremely challenging course load. Almost everyone I meet compliments me on what a hard worker I am, how polite I am, etc. None of it ever gave me any sense of pride or fulfillment. I felt like there was no point in anything that I did."
1488,I'm scared because i've been thinking about it.,"this is going to sound rude and arrogant but i am the lonliest person in the world right now and it wont ever get better. i know its easy to say for others that it will but it wont. i have nothing to offer anyone and just dont want to live anymore. i have every symptom of GAD(generalized anxiety disorder) and have done nothing about it, no money. i try to exercise everyday but it doesnt magically release endorfens and make someone desire you. after all this i cant because i fear what it will do to my family. i dont know it's going to happen eventually when i just decide to end it all."
1489,why i dont really want to live anymore,hi all
1491,what to do,"the last year has been horrible for me. lost my mom, both grandma's and my best friend. It is coming up very close to my mom's one year anniversery. she was my everything. The reason that kept me here for so long. Ive gone to psychiatrists me whole life and been told by many of them that they are surprised that i am still even here due to all the things that have happened to me in my life. I was beaten, raped, always told i was nothing and after hearing it so many times i actually believe it. I now live with my abusive alcoholic dad who tells me every day how much of a screw up i am and how much he had wished i was outta his life for good. i am 17 years old. i have tried to please him and make him love me when deep down inside i know he never will but it hurts. it really hurts. Me and my mom were very close. Did everything together. She always told me how much i meant to her and would never let me forget it. I miss her so much and nothing seems to be going right for me. i want to be with her. i cant keep going on feeling like this. I want to end my life i really do but i am afraid to."
1492,Good bye.,I think it's time now.
1493,"Clear headed, and thinking about suicide","So usually when suicidal thoughts come up in my mind, i am in a low down place, and very sad and depressed."
1494,why can't something happen and it would all be over,I'm so screwed. I can't live without my ex. She screwed the life out of me. I just can't imagine life without her.
1495,I hate this life. What else is new?,For about the past two years I have been having these suicidal thoughts and urges. I have been wishing myself to be dead and never have to deal with the world again. Want to know the real twist?
1496,i have nothing,almost 22 years old never had a job. no car or drviers license. not one friend. i live with my dad. i hate going outside no one treats me with respect. i went out cycling and some guy hit me on the arm for no reason. i smashed my bike and helmet cos i was angry and threw my ipod into the ocean. im on on 200mg/day of 5 different anti depressants im sick of taking them. i flushed them all down the toilet. ive been to 2 psychologists and a psychiatrist. i hate the way i look. i have no money. never had a girlfriend. im going to live with my dad until he dies then when im homeless ill have no choice but to kill myself. my dad is about 58 years old so i guess i got another 20 years or so. im sick of being jealous of everyone. i know if i had a friend i would also compare and compete with them. im not good at anything. i have no education and no skills. i never finished high school. im ugly and weak. hopefully ill get struck by lightning or cancer and die. i dont want to kill myself but i cant live anymore. no one has it worse than me. i sleep 4 hours a day.
1497,Looking for just 1 reason to live,"Hello everyone,"
1498,Going... going... going...,I know I haven't been online here for awhile. I also know I don't deserve to post here after just up and leaving... I didn't mean to though. My health issues nearly killed me and my husband has restricted my time on the computer.
1499,"Well, at least no one knows","Well, I guess I just learned the consequence for being spontaneous. Last night I decided to to just get it over with, so I just gabbed what I could find. Unfortunately, there were only 21 pills left, but I figured it would be enough, given that you're not supposed to exceed 8 over the course a day. So, I got myself comfortable and downed them all. Finally, I went to be for, what I thought, would be the last time. I guess you can imagine how I felt when I woke up this morning. It took a second to realize my situation. My brain was/is still foggy from the pills. I can't believe I'm still here. I was so close, and so ready for an end. Damn it."
1500,Can it really get better?,"That is what people say, it will get better. It never gets better, it gets worse everyday. I can't handle this loneliness anymore. If it doesn't kill me I will. I cannot handle waking up so alone one more time. I have no hope and I lost my desire to do anything. It won't get better. I won't be loved. I was going to say I'm sure people are sick of me whining but I don't even care anymore. What is there to care about?"
1501,suicide texts,if someone texts you theyre going to kill themselves waht are you obligated to do? What's the law?
1502,I'm scared my Dad will commit suicide,"My dad is driving my family crazy and I think he is at risk of suicide. He has been an alcoholic his whole life and suffers from depression; he is addicted to codeine and smokes pot. He has attempted to overdose on prescription pills in the past. Before I was born, he even poured petrol over himself and threatened to set himself on fire on the front lawn when he and my mum were arguing. He has been to Alcoholics Anonymous, seen counselors, doctors, been on and off antidepressants etc… but nothing seems to help because he doesn’t have the drive to help himself. He can not handle responsibility of any kind; he doesn’t even open his mail (even from his parents overseas!!)"
1503,Going.,I don't feel anything but sadness. I can't think of any good reason why I should stay here. I just want all the hurt to stop.
1504,She'll get me killed,"Pain inside my brain,"
1505,I'm just gonna go.,i think im gonna go
1506,I finally did it...DEAD,"Good, now that I have your attention let me introduce myself."
1507,All I can think about lately is ending it.,"I used to be encompassed by the romanticism of christianity. It's who I was. Simply an identity. But now as I have drawn my self far from that which I believe was simply a lie, I'm even more lost than I was before. I wake up everyday, not wanting to get out of my bed. Thinking, what's the point of going to school today? What's the purpose of all of this journey b.s. people tell me. ""Life doesn't have an end game, it's the journey they say"" Well what if my journey is miserable? What if I once always held a purpose that I believed I thought I had in the world close to me, and now I don't ever see that purpose coming to fruition or even real, any longer? If everyone dies at sometime, be it at a young age, middle age, or old age, then what am I waiting for if I'm so miserable where I am now? Until I can be old and miserable? I don't see a point in living any longer. I'm so tired of the adage: a few moments of happiness are worth living. That's completely untrue. I never remember the times I was happy. In moments of hurt and pain all I can think of is that hurt, that pain. This idiotic universe has young children that starve to death everyday and I'm able to have food at my whim, yet I'm still unhappy, it makes me want to end my life so I can't stop feeling so guilty for this self-centered view I have, an outlook I sometimes think I can change but then realize that it's way too hard, maybe even impossible to change what is essentially a human. I don't see what I have to offer the world anymore. Or what it has to offer me. I'm indelibly invaluable just like every other human being on earth and deserve to feel more than just a wash cloth that my friends, family, neighbors, and strangers can use. I'm a selfish, eighty-dimensional, vile human being that just wants to be eliminated. I find myself wishing to get cancer or die by getting run over so I will allow the universe, God, mother nature, whom ever the a-hole may be to continue to step over me, just to not break rank because I feel beaten. Beaten down by the world. Where do I turn to now? Religion? That's failed me. God? He/She has failed me? Family, friends? They've failed me. Myself? I've failed me. Who; then? Only one entity. The one who is so FAIR, so JUST, so BLIND, yet so BEAUTIFUL. Death. Death, herself. The only thing I know I can count on. I don't know why I'm writing in this forum I stumbled on. But I know I need help or I'm as good as dead. I can't even stop myself from crying right now. I haven't attempted suicide before. But, if you knew me, then you'd know I'm not one to ""attempt"" something, I would rather get it done the first time if i'm even gonna try..."
1508,Searching for way to die,"Not sure but when to end it, maybe Thanksgiving or Christmas, if I make it that long. Each day even though trying to stay busy and think of good things, positive thoughts, etc.... All the anger, sadness, and despair comes back, and will not leave."
1509,A reason that I'm scared I don't have.,I am currently dealing with everything that needs to be dealt with.
1510,Gonna drown with drugs and alcohol in pool,"time to die soon, just need to set the date. do not contact me, I am not wanting to hear it will get better crap."
1511,my worst obstical before death,i'm not really asking for help about suicide i just think that this is the best place to put it so i'm saying it here.
1512,I have issues and I feel like I want out,"I am thinking about how easy it could be to end it all, even though I probably never will because I don't have the guts. It scares me because what if I do someday? Seeing as I don't think it's ever gonna get better I think it's possible that day could come. Doesn't anyone understand?!?!? Oh here I am complaining about my stupid life again. My stupid unimportant life. What the hell am I whining about anyways? Who cares. I feel like screaming screw the world! Why am I cursed with the fear of death?"
1513,Suicidal thoughts 90% of the time,"Guys,"
1514,Anyone else in the same sitution as me?,"OK, I am autistic and cannot be left in the house alone. Every time my dad goes out, he has to bring me with him. My dad has a girlfriend, and whenever they go out together as a couple (to a pub/restaurant etc) I have to be there with them and I feel uncomfortable. They even have to go to pubs of my choice rather than of theirs 99% of the time. They can only go out on their own 2 days a week when my mum looks after me. I feel sorry for them. Also I do DJing as a hobby but practice at home. I practice when my dad and his gf are there, though they enjoy it and dance together, I constantly feel I am preventing them having a quiet romantic evening in. I asked my dad whether I should give up my DJing so that they could be together more and he said no. And i am scared that if ever they spilt up, then no other woman would put up with it. I have told him I would give up my life because of them and am in a conflict over whether I should give up my DJing."
1515,I want to die but I'm not suicidal.,Hi all.
1516,What should I do?,"I believe one of my friends is suicidal, tonight she said that she wanted out permanently. I think the stress of her life is getting to her. She has Asperger's Syndrome, so I think that because she has a ""thin skin"" she let people get to her more than you and I would. She works part time and lives with her parents. I want to get her some help, and I think that if her parents knew, they'd help her. However, she is 32, so I don't really want to rat her out, or be childish about this. I mean she is a full grown adult. I don't really know what to do, any advice?"
1517,Just Found A Very Old Suicide Note,
1518,oh damn...,ive been having a bad day for 6 weeks.
1519,Nobody I know will want to help until it's too late,"This is one of the things that saddens me. I always ask myself, ""Why will they cry when I'm dead but shed not a tear while I'm alive and so miserable?"" Nobody can know the severity of your problem until it's too late. Everybody thinks when I talk of killing myself that it's not serious and that it'll never happen. It's almost as if they're daring me to do it, yet I know if I did they would want to take what they said back then."
1520,hurt and frustrated,"I never knew I was such a lousy person. I woke up to a horrible message from a person today on Facebook. I was told that I'm self-centered, negative, rude, ugly and a horrible artist. I'm an idiot as well. I struggle every day to tell myself that I'm an attractive person and that I have so much to offer. I don't have friends. It's hard for me to have time for people if I'm lucky enough to find someone to spend time with. I have been dealt a horrible hand in life. I'm not just saying it to be dramatic, I think most would understand if they only knew. Rather, if they only listened. No one is willing to listen or to even try to begin to attempt to understand. I've dated complete jerks. I've been the victim of my father and child molestation. I was abandoned by my mother. I was used by my foster family to make them look better in society. I work very hard and work insane hours that no one is willing just to be able to pay the bills. I've put myself through school and I still continue to do so all the while facing problems with cost and tuition. But I'm trying my hardest. I always do. I just have so much that has gone wrong. I try to not dwell but seriously how can you not when they seem to just keep happening one after another. I beg and pleed for something to go right each day every morning. I don't have anyone to talk to and it just keeps growing and growing. I seceretly have been facing demons for a long time in regards to suicide. I honestly think that if I didnt have my pets, who always seem to make me happy, that I would have done something a long time ago. they are what keeps me going. it would be selfish for me because they depend on me. They are just as misunderstood as I so I know that my life ending would mean their lives ending. I'm restless all the time. I toy with the idea of what I could do and when. How would I do it? Questions of that nature. I'm finding that I'm completely at peace with death. I'm not worried or scared. I actually find myself almost happy knowing that once I'm gone nothing can hurt me anymore. Not happy as in laughing more calm and euphoric I guess. I kind of feel great. I wish that I could feel this good about living. I'm just so sick of hurting so so badly. I'm sick of being alone and so disliked. It seems that everyone in this city has their opinions about me and nothing is true. besides they all never really knew me. It's mostly based upon a horrible relationship I was in before. the guy was incredibly emotionally, mentally, physically and sexually abusive. People looked out for his best interest. They never knew or believed the truth. I have never had good friends really and that's all I want. I actually have no friends. I had a couple and was mocked and ridiculed by them. I felt like I was the loser chick in high school kicked out of the cool girl club and if anyone knows what it's like to deal with mean girls, it sucks. Not to mention try working with them and having the boss adore them and make your life hell. Things just don't work out for me. I just don't know what to do. I try so hard to not give up but whats the point anymore. People mock me for being bipolar and for being poor. it really hurts. I just want friends. I don't even have family except for my pups. I don't think I'm ever going to have friends and for that matter a guy in my world. I guess it's over for me. People like me are just not worth much."
1521,Reflections on the Passed...,I've been dictating this post in my head off and on for a few days now. But this is my first attempt at sitting down and writing it.
1522,Suicide Grief Help,
1523,i wanna die saving someone else's life,i think something is messed up with me. i attempted suicided when i was 18 by ODing. didn't work and lately (im 23 now) i've been thinking about dying again. but i dont wanna attempt suicide anymore. if i die like that it feels like a waste. i've been fantasizing about dying by saving a kid from a car crash or saving someone from getting shot.
1525,Help,i dunno how to start so i guess i hope itll just come out.
1526,Im not sure if this is your typical suicide thread,I dont really think im trying to get anyone to help me but i dont know. Im not suicidal but i feel like ive been for so long that i dont even know how to live a life that it isnt a part of it. I honestly could have a panic attack and freak out and just basically be fighting for my life at any moment. Ive never tried it but i have basically seen that just thinking about doing it can help me just feel like i get away from my painful life. Ive always lived in my own world and basically having that world be shattered is one of the biggest issues ive had to deal with. Its just for whatever reason i cant completely leave my world and deal with my real life. I have alot of issues that i cant even go into because it brings me right back into how i was before. I think simple things like just going thru a day without wanting to basically do something bad to myself or anyone else is a struggle. I dont know how to talk about this but even like eating or taking care of myself are things i can do easily.
1527,Life sucks... but checking out is worse,No help here. time to die.
1528,Today really sucked ass,
1529,"I'm 20 years old, I don't want to live.","But I don't want to kill myself. I've tried cutting, don't like it. It hurts, and I don't see the reason or get the feeling others speak of from it."
1530,I've exhausted every possibility.,"I'm eighteen years old. I've been with the same manipulating, cheating, lying, succubus for the last five years. We were suppose to have a daughter last April, but her father aborted her. She is constantly throwing her affairs in my face. Pictures, videos, stories... She say's she cares yet she does it over and over again. She feeds off anything she can do to hurt me and shares it openly with her friends and lovers. So here's the fun part. Why am I still with her? I've tried leaving her several times, all in which she was completely apathetic. Weeks sometimes months later she would show up and sleep with me and leave and that's the last I would hear from her for awhile. I finally figured out I was pathetic and put and end to all ties to her. In my absence she was fine. I think she met several new guys and friends and what not, But I on the other hand had no friends or anybody. I was alone all the time. Basically I sat alone in my room from the time I woke up til the time I went to sleep. At first I thought I was okay with this and continued playing computer games and what not. After about the sixth month of our breakup I couldn't take it any longer. I went to see her and it was all for nothing. We spent the night together and everything went out the window. Back to the start. After getting jealous when she cheated again I decided to move to another Country. After doing this my life didn't really change at all. I continued to stay in my room for the next 7 1/2 months alone. Eventually I realized something was wrong with me after I freaked out one night and tried to drown myself in my bathroom. A week later I went to a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with OcD, Depression and Social Anxiety Disorder."
1531,"I don't think I can go on, living the way I am at the moment :(",Hello.
1532,What are your thoughts ?,"I read sometimes how so many people go through tough times in their lives and are at their end of their wits and think sucide is the way out. Reason I""m saying this is because i've been through the tough and rough times and numerous times i wanted committ suicide. I wanted to end it. But something always stops me from wanting to do it. Does anyone get that feeling of not going through with it? And what are you reason's for not going through with the sucide?"
1533,Why is it so hard?!?!?!,"I'm going out of my mind! I hate it so much, I just want to get out! I failed twice this week. I just want it to be over. I'm not afraid of dying. I'm afraid of hurting. I want to talk to someone but then I remember that I DON'T HAVE ANYONE!!! There is no where for my mind to turn. No escape. I just want this to be over. I couldn't sleep at all last night. I've spent the last hour looking for something I can do comfortably. I HATE THIS! I HATE BEING THIS WAY! If I wasn't so afraid of the madness I'd go back to the pills, but what that does to your mind was worst than what I'm feeling now, and then there is till no guarantee considering I'm still after how much I took last time. I'm so tired and so sad. I don't have anything or anyone left. I just want to leave. Why does it have to be so hard..."
1534,I don't know what to do...,I feel like just giving up.
1535,I am 13 and have attempted suicide.,I am only 13 I have attempted to commit suicide. It oviously didnt work
1536,i wanna kill myself now,i have had enough of like i cant cope any more i would be better off killing myself now i just want of my life to be over there is nothing good in my life anymore please i cant take this pain any longer just let me die and be a peace
1537,privately,"I don't know why I'm here, but I can't seem to be able to deal with the pressure anymore. I can't walk into a room without thinking of how to end it with whatever I happen to see."
1538,So alone,I cant deal with anything. I am so depressed. i cut myself all the time. i cant seem 2 stop. people r trying 2 help me but thats only making me feel worse; i hate it when people take pity on me. I do not want 2 c a therapist or talk 2 anyone. They will tell my parents i have tried 2 kill myself and that im suicidal and ill b sent off 2 some hospital. It is painful gion through each day. I just need some 2 talk 2 who understands me. please.
1539,death is around the corner,"im gonna end it, just waiting on the supply? I am posting because i guess i want some attention. Although i think i have made my mind up. If there was a will, there would be a way. But my regret is too large. Im 25 and * * * * ed. I am selfish, cause i obviously dont seem to care that i am gonna hurt my family. Even though i really do care, i seem to block out emotions more and more due to my numbing depression. Ok anyway. Thats that. Best to all, just waiting, contemplating, and about to catch the bus. Cheers"
1540,Losing Battles,I don't know what to put here.
1542,i can c no valid point in living,I started a thread this afternoon asking how 2 stop all of the bleeding because i cut 2 deep. This happens alot i just usually dont have a computer near me. i think cutting is the only thing that keeps close to reality and feeling something. The only thing i have 2 look forward to in life. i can see no other meaning or point. but i would really like 2 find Something. so if anyone has any suggestions???????................
1543,If I didn't have my Mom I wouldnt be here....,I have no joy in life and would end it if it wasnt for my mother. Sick of feeling this way but having trouble shaking it. Its been 3 years like this and I will never be the same....
1544,I dont feel like myself anymore,I felt like there was always something that would at least keep me trying to do things good anymore. I just feel like at the point that im at there is nothing anyone can do to make me feel any different. I feel like there is something inside of me that i cant even let it out. Ive had to endure stuff that makes you turn into a messed up person. I constantly deal with thoughts of things that you should really never have to think about. I see that no matter how good of a person you are things can still make you into a messed up person. Ive never felt this low to where its like nothing matters. Its like i could kill myself right now and it would mean nothing but i guess thats the one good that Ive seen about myself is i wont kill myself. I actually dont talk about this alot but i actually would want to try to convince myself to kill myself because it was like no matter what i couldnt do it. I guess to me it felt like i was a failure or something.
1545,Can't take the feeling of loneliness anymore and don't see the point of living,"I'm 18 years old and for the past six months I have been in agony over losing the only girl I ever loved to her ex-boyfriend. I knew her for ages and never even got to kiss her. I'm alone now. I have no friends, a dysfunctional family that I have never really been close to, I live in a half decorated dump of a house with my stressed out mother who takes out all her problems on me, I'm a virgin, I'm a stone underweight, I have terrible confidence/social problems and I feel lonely, depressed and above all, completely and utterly suicidal."
1546,the living dead,"I had a pretty rough childhood. I try not to talk about it because people judge you, but I was sexually abused, had a crazy mom going to school working poor and on public aid, my father drinking his way to the grave-somehow he didn't die but had a blood clot in his brain and is disable. I remained fairly positive and did well in school. Occasionally I'd wish I had a different life, I'd imagine what some other girl I admired was doing, but only thought about suicide for very short seconds and hardly ever. I waited until I was 22 or 23 to loose my virginity-I LOVED this boy. We had issues ourselves and though I thought I was past mine this is a red flag for me. We broke up a while ago we got back together a time or two. I felt this was true love but knew that wasnt ok. we had nc a year. Everyone has put up with my sadness long enough. I recently was seeing him and boy was I happy. He had to leave for a commitment teaching in korea. He met someone. I want to feel joy for him, he left 6 months ago but I feel like the living dead. I am sad and tired and have no desires. The worst part is I have to tell my family I'm fine cause they have seen me sad too much. My younger sisters father killed himslf and thats the thing that holds me back-I dont want her to loose anymore. I told my older sister I don't see the point im life and she said that I need meds. Shes taken them but not anymore. Shes over a recent divorce and I can't get over loosing this boy I love. Do I need meds-I'm into a clean lifestyle and very anti meds/pillpopping but this is draggimg on andd I have to see him at his sisters wedding in a month."
1547,not happy where i am in life,"so i am mainly looking to vent and just share where i am. the last month or so i have been really down on myself. i dont feel like much of a success. i feel like i am alone. i have very few friends and even fewer that i actually hang out with. i cant ever seem to get a girl to like me past a couple of dates. and then i manage to screw it up with the ones that may actually be starting to have feelings for me. i really only stayed friends with one person from high school and he took his own life about 5 years ago. i have been sad/depressed for as long as i can remember. not just about him, but about my life in general. the last month or so it has seem to be worse for me. for the first time in a long time i have thought about suicide rather than just wanting to disappear. today i took a short walk to the store and nearly started crying for really no reason. i was just really sad and it got to me. i dont feel like i am having success at my job and while i should be thankful i have a job in these days, thats not enough. i feel lonely constantly. i am in love with a girl who wont give me the time of day lately. i dont have anybody to go to or people to spend time with to get my mind off of her. i am struggling to find a reason to go on. people say to find a hobby or join a club but very few things interest me. i just want to withdrawal from society. thanks for taking the time to read."
1548,Nothings helping!!,Ive been going through hell for last 3 months. I tried to cope up with the situation and it seems to get worse!
1549,effects of accidental vs. suicide,"I was just wondering, is it harder for someone to get over the death of a family member who died by suicide, rather than dying accidentally? say like in a car crash or something like that?"
1551,destroyed at 18,hey everyone! at the end of 2008 my life pretty much began a downwards spiral which has nearly reached the bottom. I'm in a lot of trouble and need help quickly or I am going to have to take things into my own hands and end my life.
1552,"""You won't do it so just quit talking about it.""","That's what my friend told me this evening on the phone when I was discussing methods. Freaked out and yelled that at me. Told me I'm self absorbed, stupid, no good, etc. Just calls me to bury me six feet under and laugh at me. I don't think I'm going to answer the phone next time. I don't need people like that wiping their ass on me on my way out."
1554,four years...,wow that's a long time. I joined here what nearly three years ago now.
1555,Not Sure Where I Should Be,"I'm not sure if I should be writing here or in the self-harming area. I've been feeling overwhelmed with suicidal thoughts recently. I dream about it, I day dream about it. It's consuming me. The only relief I get is from cutting myself. It's the only thing that takes my mind away for any length of time, but they aren't a cure. I haven't even made it 2 full months since my last attempt. I don't want to be this way! I just want to be normal. I want to not wake up already feeling like crap. I don't care how it stops. I don't care if it's through some medicine, or therapy, or death. I just want it to END! Thus far, therapy, and medication haven't done a thing..."
1556,Pain,"Wow, i never thought i would see myself here."
1557,There really isn't a solution. Is that good enough reason?,"I'm not sure if this is really suicide thread appropriate... However in the past month, I have been making lists of why, and why not to, and well it's looking like over 50 on the why and like 2 on the why not."
1558,Don't Know what to Do,"It's getting so hard to make it through the day. I finally finished my degree but I don't have any motivation to do anything. I want help but I can't ask for it. I was diagnosed with BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder), and one of the characteristics/symptoms is wanting to be saved. So, to overcome that I do my best to not talk to anyone about these feelings now. So now, I'm completely alone with them. I spend most of my days/nights semi or unconscious with the help of an over the counter sedative. It's the only way I can keep myself safe other than cutting to distract myself from it. Even sleep isn't really that pleasant because I have chronic nightmares. How long is a person supposed to live before they're allowed to give up. The irony is that I have a kid sister who also struggles with depression and suicidal thought, and I'm the only person she talks to about it. I'm the one who's always trying to convince her that life is worth living. Meanwhile, inside I feel the exact same way as her. I'm so tired. I hate myself so much. I feel like a hypocrite and a failure. All the while the scars on my wrist remind me of how close I was to getting out. They're indicative of the resolve I had, the courage. I keep reminiscing. Just a few more minutes and it would have been too late. If I hadn't been found or if I it had been a 2 minutes longer, I would be here now."
1560,Can not stop thinking about killing myself,I think the subject line says it all. I can't stop thinking about doing myself in. I can't take it anymore. I don't want to die but I can't live like this anymore. Oh god. I feel trapped in an endless misery.
1561,I dont even know if i should be writing this,"Ive been so up and down and its like nothing is moving along. I get a couple of hours at most where all my issues dont come and completely consume me with anger and depression. I keep on thinking it cant get worse and it does. I try to handle my emotions and everything the best that i can but usually i just go into a rage to where i feel like im losing myself. I feel like once you go thru so much you can never go back to how you were. I guess its not all that bad because i didnt like things so much before but at least it wasnt all bad. Ive had moments of complete darkness to where i sit in my room with nothing to do because i cant enjoy anything. I have so many things im going to have to work on and then so much work to really pursue any type of life for me. Ive been sleeping at all hours and its pretty f-ing crazy. Im like from another world where i cant even describe what my life is like on a day to day basis. Im just doing whatever i can to not really let all my messed up emotions go out towards anyone else. I cant even describe all the really sick thoughts i have. I then end up having to tell myself that my life will get better when most of the time i dont believe it. Im trying to but i just feel like ive been thru enough and this cant go on forever. I dont even know how to even live with what im going thru. I basically spend all my time thinking about things outside of myself. Im supposed to think that there is a place in this world for me and that somehow this was just a part of my life but its completely ruined so much without saying its pretty much ruined everything. I have no passion, no outlet, no place to go because even when im doing things everything still haunts me. I used to imagine having a better life and that would drive me but i dont see that happening anymore. I can see people that have things work out for them but what type of life are you supposed to live when things dont work out for you. Its only so much you can find in yourself to get thru the bad times. I cant even get along with most people now because im so out of it that i dont even feel like im in touch with what its like to be human. I dont want to get into alot of things about my past but i will say everything that ive been thru has made me have a couple of years of memory loss and battles with delusions and sucidal thoughts. Im doing everything i can without basically killing myself to deal with this or get something out of this. I also just get tired of people saying stupid things like oh this is a long post or its not all spaced or in paragraphs. Its like little things like that people just say all the time and for what. Its like im going thru so much and you think it matters if i wrote less or made it in order. The thing i dont like about that is that i dont go around and say oh wow yours is so short or its spaced out because people would take that as a compliment. Its just because alot of people think that way it becomes acceptable and then its fine. Im just so different and i dont see how im going to get along with people who arent like me because most people dont deal with that well and then i react out of defense and its just a big problem. I just wish there was some way to get a break from all of this craziness that happens all the time that people just deal with. Its just every little thing becomes a big thing because of all the stuff im going thru. I just wish someone could stop and really think but most people can only see things thru their own eyes and then someone like me is stuck because i try to look outside of myself. Its like things that can never be worked out and its like oil and water but with me im always sticking out or being the outsider so somehow im supposed to just deal with this all the time. It would just be nice if it didnt have to be to where im basically am struggling to where its pretty much embarrassing. I dont even know what im trying to say but i guess thats my problem is there is so much that cant be described and im struggling with it everyday. I just hope it doesnt drive me crazy or something eventho i cant count that out anymore."

1564,Need to talk to someone,Hi
1565,Thanks,"I see a school counciller at the moment which is okay I guess but I am going to start group therapy soon. I am very suicidal and I haven't been going to school at all really about 2 days off a week and I am just completely lost between my panic attacks and depression, I am trying to be strong but I don't know how long I can carry on. I feel so stupid for writing this because I never really like to talk about things and posting a thread would be the last thing I would have done for my suicidal desires."
1566,I need somebody to talk to,"I feel there is nowhere else to go. As I am 13 ANYBODY that I tell I am thinking of suicide would displace me, or try to fool me by saying that everything will be alright. I don't understand this. What I really don't understand is why I want to go though. I am literally bored enough to not want to live anymore. It seems like I fit nowhere in life and I just can't cope with the fact that I live in a * * * * ty world, and may have to deal with it. I just need somebody to help me because I feel this is the last place I can go. The only place where I know I won't be proclaimed an idiot for doing what feels right for me."
1567,How much does it take to e suicidal?,How much does it take to be suicidal?
1568,I dont know what to do anymore. I need help,"alright the past couple years i have felt that my life has been absolutely meaningless, There is nothing wrong with my life though, i have not suffered any trauma, i love my parents, problem is i dont believe in anything. What is the point to the game we play every day? why do people take it so seriously and why cant i learn to enjoy it and find meaning like everyone else? I am 17 years old and probably the most ordinary guy you would see, I have a lot of friends and i am fairly popular in my school, its just that when im with people i find that I have no real feelings of actually wanting or needing them as a friend/ aquantice. I really could care less what they do or say. I wouldnt care if suddenly they were just gone. i feel like i am living in a world in which everything is a lie and i am trapped. i am finding it hard to find purpose in the activities i do....i feel that i force myself to do them. if you met me there would be know way of knowing any of this about me besides the fact that i am quite and display minimal amounts of emotion. the only thing i can find joy in is art. i can let out how i feel about the disgusting world in which im trapped in... I often contemplate the idea of suicide and wonder what it would be like to escape, but normally i instantly dismiss it because i am an atheist, i believe in nothing after life, so if i die now then i am done. and to be honest that idea scares me, but what scares me more is the idea of being trapped and not being able to escape. i really dont know what to do. And recently i have been under so much stress that i am beginning to want to end it...i feel like all i am is mediocrity, and thats all i want but people are belligerent and keep demanding more..i am getting sick of it. A user named Rain man posted something a little better worded a while ago that kind of says what i was trying to say about my feelings...please help me out on this, i feel so trapped"
1569,Life itself is an ordeal,"It's an ordeal and a terrible deal. It would be OK if there was something that made it all worthwhile, but there's not. Maybe if I was a handsome man who could actually talk to people and have a girlfriend, I could have a life worth living. Now it's not. I'm just here to be laughed at and spit upon."
1570,Death seems to be the only option,"Ive been going through the worse times of of my life! i lost my dad recently and have huge medical bills to cope with, m not happy with my job coz its just for the sake of it i just dont get any satisfation out of it! I am doing college but that too seems going nowwehre!"
1571,feeling insane,I feel completely and unterlly tore up.
1572,Tonight,I want to do it tonight. I want to let my friends know how much i care about them but i am worried that they would think something was up. One would know and would try to stop me and i dont want that. I want to be able to just do it and not have to exist anymore. Is it selfish is i talk to someone while *method* has a chance to make it into my system. I want to do it but dont want to be alone. I have tried this before without success.
1573,jesus the healer,if anyone would like prayer please ask
1574,My story,"I was fine, not great, but fine nonetheless, until about a couple of months ago. I was sort of seeing this girl with whom I work with. As it turns out, I was merely nothing more than her ""crutch"", so to speak. You see, she's married to an abusive * * * * * * * who treats her like * * * * . So she comes to me one night, pouring her heart out about how unhappy she is and tells me that she's interested in me."
1575,Can I just... Disappear please...,"Ahh, I gaze up at the stars with true moral inflection as my veins and my body twist and contort with every single emotion. Where am I heading to, is it a beautiful place? Is it something I want, will I regret it? Everything I've done has put me in a special place in life, a place where I wonder if I had only taken the last left turn would I be somewhere else? Ah... it only brings me down to the place, this shallow cold and desolate road, it brings me... I come to the place where I hide all my fears and put on a mask to show the world that I can smile and laugh but feeling so helpless and so cold when I shut my eyes. Every dream, every step, a permanent reminder of what has happened to me and why it has happened. Only to lead me to this path, a road that has no end, a road that blinds me with such agony and such pain. Emotions crawl inwards up my skin as the reaper sharpens his scythe, staring at my cold empty blue eyes, that are only dark with tears that haunt every inch of what is left of me. Is it right? Is it wrong... Where will I go... do I get a second chance? A second chance... It is what makes my blood pump with hope and keeps me moving throughout my bitter cold and empty roads. This path... I feel like I can just end it, take a nap, then I can finally find my peace in a world that feels so unscathed. Unscathed by the agony of truth, unscathed by the bitterness of cold reality. The world, a desolate and cold fate, the world, a dark and dreary empty place where hope is given to those who have the strength to find it. Where is my hope... where did my dreams go... Oh...that's right... They went away because of my weakness. My inability to grow, my inability to change fast enough, my dreams.... If only I had looked at the world right the first time, if only I had gazed with the eyes I have now could I have taken that other road.... But this path....I see no other turns, only a dead end. Is it the end for me.... It feels cold... my skin feels cold... my heart aches. Is it wrong for me to be selfish? Can I please be selfish? Just this once.... I'll turn to you, and I'll smile with up-most vigilence as I slowly slip the veil of deceit into my mouth. I am cold... I feel so cold.... I have yet to make a move, I wonder if it because I am scared of what will happen.... Where I am going.... why I am going there.... I slowly shut my eyes to feel the bitterness in my skin....ahh... that's right, I remember now."
1577,Emergency Room,I haven't committed suicide or made an attempt but I feel like I could in my current state after my boyfriend broke up with me. Have any of you gone to the emergency room in this state? Do you know what they could do for me?
1578,"I hate my 70hr/week job, and it's all I have","I worked my ass off my entire life, earned a BA and a JD. I am $90k in debt. I am working 70hours/week as a law clerk and earning 30k a year. I get to work at 8:30am and work until 8pm. I spend all day researching and writing a motion to have my lawyer ""mentor"" walk downstairs to tell me I ***ed up and misaligned his name on the cover page. He gives me zero guidance and zero praise. He takes my work and puts his name on it. He take my work and keeps all the money. A law firm is a pyramid scam and they screw you until you quit or until you become just like the guys at the top."
1579,Suicide as a ploy or for real?,"My soon to be ex husband threatened suicide multiple times. It started when he asked me to take our son and leave his home. It continued on throughout the beginning of the summer, then by the end of the summer, when he ""got me back"" it ended. When I filed for divorce, he wanted to reconcile and threatened it again. Did anyone here ever use a suicide threat as BOTH a ploy AS WELL AS consider it seriously?"
1581,death is my destiny,i dont want to live anymore ive given up on life all is so artificial and sadist! dont know y m i posting here but yes i cant go on anymore.... death is the answer to all misiries
1582,I think I tried and failed,OK last night I needed to go out not anywhere in particular just had to go outside for a while so I went for a drive.
1583,difficult,"My girlfriend recently left me and moved out. We had lived together for about 2 years, dated for 3. She left saying she didn't love me anymore, and couldn't have me in her life. Her email on our computer showed that she had been sending certain types of photos out to some guy, who she had kissed once a few months back, and I had forgiven her. I believe she left me for him. her friends introduced her to him a few months back, knowing he was exactly her type of guy, planning behind my back to have them hit it off. i feel betrayal from all sides. It's the first thing in my life that's ever made me crash like this. I haven't eaten for days, haven't left, barely have done anything. I have faced death of loved ones before, because I can understand it; I know it has to happen. What happened to me shouldn't happen."
1584,Change of plans,"After years and years of suffering, my plan was originally to end my life today. I wont go into specifics why, just that it was my plan."
1585,seriously,going to end it.
1587,Seems like the best idea....,I guess I just need a strangers point of view...
1588,I need help...,"I think that I am depressed and it’s affecting my entire life. It was ok a couple of months back, but now I can’t do anything. I am always tiered and sleep too much. I have skipped most of my classes in the last two weeks. I can’t concentrate at all, so I haven’t done my homework. I got horrible grades in the last 3 test I took. The semester is almost over, but I don’t know if I can make it until the end. I have alienated all my friends (which are now only acquaintances), I stay inside my dorm and avoid everyone."
1589,I don't want to live anymore.,"Hi everyone. I should be really happy with my life. I am part of a well-off family, and have everything that I could ever want. I go to an excellent private school, which will give me one of the best education opportunities available in the state of Victoria. However, I am feeling horrible."
1590,Over and Out.,"All I do is give give give. Nobody gives back. Its been a while since anybody helped me. Nobody cares. My life sucks. America Sucks. GM is dead, thanks to politicians. I dont care about anything anymore."
1591,Tragedy,I just like to say something about a coworker of mine.
1592,cant take this crap and teasing anymore...,"i dont know how i got myself in this mess... i cringe even thinking about it... my group of friends... well one of the people in the group is very popular and dosent like me so... the others dont talk to me either now out of fear... im nice to that popular girl, lets call her mellisa, but shes always mean. so when im mean to her, just to show her how its like, mellisa gets mad. i cant talk to boys around her, she would scream out im flirting. so i found new friends. mellisa and her gang wont leave me alone still.... im tall for my age, 13, and she bugs me about it. we had this race to run, as fast as we could and i came in first out off all the girls, and second in boys and girls, first being a boy. well mellisa saw me running and called me a elephant, a t-rex , a bull and many other things. now this guy likes mellisa so he agreed with her. then at school i hear that guy saying "" i beat the elephant in a race"" and my crush laughs and says haha thats funny... now well i couldve handled this until my crush laughed as well.... i have some sleeping pills...probably enough to end my pain... i dont see another way rigth now.."
1593,goodbye,"I'm going up to Huntsville this weekend to get the gun. so goodbye everybody. Daniel Groff can have his way, his lying and * * * * ing with my head finally worked and all this friends can go to hell along with him."
1594,is this normal?,"the feeling of wanting to die. is there something wrong with you if you just dont want to live anymore? i cant think of any event or trigger to make me feel this way, i just want to die. why? i don't feel sad, or depressed, or anything."
1595,Not wanting to live vs wanting to die,How thin is the line between not wanting to live and wanting to die? Hmm I suppose it's different for everyone. It's not something you can really bring up in conversation so I thought I'd ask here
1596,I WISH I could kill myself...,"I have a new job pushing carts that I'm entirely grateful for, but I'm an utter failure at it (along with everything else in my life, and DO NOT SAY ""why not be a writer"" because I HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE writing and HATE people telling me I should do something boring like that with myself, but it's one of the only other ways I can express myself besides singing or masturbating and I don't even get that kind of relief from writing either.) I have to be there AT GOD DAMN 7 IN THE GOD DAMN MORNING! I'm all on my own too; I'm expected to know every little thing and be as good as the guy I'm replacing (and this dude made EMPLOYEE OF THE FRIKKIN MONTH ARGH!) but I've barely spent a shift outside. I'm tired of having the damn weight of a job resting on my shoulders... I'm tired of living in this hell. All I'm good at is ticking people off and work is no exception. I'm most likely gonna fail this job sooooo bad, and my mom's gonna kill me. I do everything wrong; show me how to do it right, and I will fail 9999999 times before I even SOMEWHAT succeed at it. People like to make fun of me for this and I can't say I blame them... at least I make them laugh, even if it's at my expense. I've failed everything; school, work, art... I hate me. I can't even yank my rod and splatter my urges all over myself 'cause my mom is up all night watching TV (she's a super-feminist who treats women as if they're nothing less than supreme goddesses and men are evil creatures except the beta-males but I think both feminism and chauvinism is equally retarded) and is against necessary male things I wish I didn't have to do like masturbating. I kind of hate women though; I don't HATE them personally, but I hate the relationship I have between me and womanhood. When it comes to using the left side of my brain, I'm like worse than a male version of Usagi (Sailor Moon) and the loser ""Seinen"" guy thing doesn't work well in the real world... the underdog thing is only a fantasy. The little guy gets chewed up and spit out in the real world... I hate it, but that's reality. The underdog becoming a winner? That's mostly only in the movies; I just feel doomed to mediocrity and it makes me wanna puke my god damn guts out and KEEP them out. I feel sick to my stomach; I feel like all I'm gonna do is keep failing 'cause that's all I've truly experienced (kinda like Charlie Brown)."
1597,i really need some help,i'm so close to over the edge. ive thought about suicide over and over again. the only 2 things stoppin me is the fact that i know how it is 2 loose somebody 2 suicide and my bestfriend.
1598,bye,well this is it... I am packing my stuff because I can no longer afford to live in my roomates apartment.. I am calling my parents to get my camping equipment from their house.. I am also gonna buy a rope to hang myself with in the woods when i cant take it anymore. Ive already spent time in a homeless shelter and id rather die than go back.
1599,Why Not?,"There is nothing positive left in life anymore... my days are just a big problem it seems like now... I'm bored, bored of all the people, all the stupid things they do, bored of everyday life there is no point to it, the average person caught up in society makes me angry and physically ill sometimes... I'm not sure how I got this way, I used to love life I used to play sports and always hang out with friends constantly, it just seems like I've seen it all now, there is nothing new to do, no wonder in anything, just monotony... All I feel like doing is sleeping all day, infact I have only been awake 8 of the last 24 hours and I already feel tired again... I have no energy to do anything, there is nothing that interests me anymore I've seen it all... finals at my college are this week, they're going to be damn near impossible, I don't even want to try at them... I had so many things I wanted to do, but now I realize they are all almost impossible, and can and will never happen..."
1601,Afraid of everyone and feeling pressure to escape,"I'm tired of being afraid of people. They scare me. I'm a social anxiety nutcase who is afraid of everyone on the whole planet. They're all out to get me. Laugh at me, point, spit on me and so forth, even if they don't do it to my face I think they are behind my back. I can't face this anymore. Social situations of any kind make me worry so much that I can't stand it. The thought of going to work tomorrow, of going to the store, of talking to my mom on the phone, of visiting my family, ANYTHING that has to do with seeing people in person. I can't deal with it anymore."
1602,How can I change my life?,"Hi, I am looking for answers. I have been on and off depression meds for the past 5 years. None of them have helped. Ive been on Lexapro, Wellbutrin, and Zoloft. I dont know what is wrong with me. I dont enjoy life at all. I feel too tired to do anything. Everyone just says I am lazy, but I feel that is is much more than that. I have no motivation for life, I wish I had a another way to describe it, but I have no passion for anything, at all. I used to write, I havent written anything in years, something inside of me is just completely dead. I used to ride the bus, and come up w/ fun little stories, just being out and around people inspired me. Now I just want to sit in my room. I was nearly kicked out of college this semester (I dropped my courses so that I couldnt be disqualified.)"
1603,Is it worth it?,"I am here because I don't know where else to be. I don't want to burden anyone with my thoughts but I can't write them down fast enough. In my short 32 years, I have lost my father to a tragic accident, had my best friend/adopted little sister murdered, had a friend commit suicide and many more deaths and tragedies. I was anorexic and lucky for me it was caught early, doesn't seem so lucky to me now I am fat and ugly and unwanted. If you have seen the movie ""Twilight"" you will understand a little what I am thinking. There is this amazing relationship between Edward and Bella and that is what I need. I feel so drawn to the characters it's not even funny, I feel a lot like Bella, odd and ordinary. I am nothing spectacular and have been verbally abused my whole life. I am having a hard time just getting my butt out of bed. To have human affection would greatly help me, just being touched gently or kissed or hugged. But with society the way it is, I don't even see that possible. Why do things we humans want so bad only ever happen in movies? I haven't thought about ending my life for a few months, I was doing really good, maybe it's because I have been on and off my medication, wish I could afford it all the time. It really helps but even taking it, I am still feeling this way. I want to not kill myself, just render myself unconscious for a few days and make the world see that I am here and see if I really do have any friends. That sounds dumb too. I have a huge crush on this guy (yeah it still happens to us old farts) and he is one of the few people I can talk to when I see him. He's super kind and I find my heart twitter when I see him, that is an amazing feeling but I guess that is all it will be. I used to have penpals to write snail mail letters to and that was really good for me but nobody wants to write letters anymore, wish they did. Anyways, I could ramble on and on but it's all going to say the same."
1605,You've all thought it,"I've decided that i don't see the point in living. I know that i must live until i'm 42, because that's when i can be sure they are all dead, but I wish i could just kill myself now. i hate my life, i know the people around me either wouldn't care or would get over it."
1606,Dont read if you dont care,"I dont know where to begin, no one on this forum seems to want to talk to me. I dont know why, it could be because ABSOLUTELY NOBODY CARES about me. Its not just a thought i believe it because of people are never there for me when i need it , or at all. I dont have anyone..at all. I just cant meet good people. All i know are bad people. A lot of bad things have happened to me and they just continue to keep happening, and theres nothing i can do to stop it. I want to be dead. Im tired of the pain physically and mentally, im tired of worries, and stress, and emotions, im tired of thoughts, and people, just everything. If nobody feels like responding to me, it just backs up my beliefs that nobody cares."
1607,I dont even know if suicide is the word anymore,"Ive had to deal with suicidal thoughts for over 2 years. It all started once my ex was going to break up with me. At first she needed time but that was really just an excuse to break up with me but she couldnt do it. She was spending time with someone else and she was basically caring more about him then me. I cant even begin to describe how crazy my life has been since. Ive been delusional, my memory was basically totally blocked out after it happened, i have severe anxiety and OCD, and basically am stuck living the same * * * * ty life i had to live before. I have no real friends and my ex was basically the only friend that i could consider a good friend. Its just at the same time she was abusive and neglectful. Anyone that has never been around that will basically simply say that its not good for you so you should be happy that your not with them. Its just that becomes your comfort level so even if its not good for you your mind makes it like it is. I really dont know how you get away from someone that you were also really codependent with. Ive tried therapy and have gone to support groups but that doesnt fix anything. I basically wont be able to get over this until the pain from all of this is over. Thats where i end up having to deal with my very messed up life so either way i dont see things gettin better for me. I can say to keep hope alive and to keep trying to see if things get better but that can only work for so long. Ive hit rockbottom and have been there again so i dont really see much else happening. This is what i feel like inside completely black and empty with no real life."
1608,This feels different then all the other times,Ive wrote about suicide alot on this site but this is the first time that its really serious. Usually its a panic type situation and even then ive been really close. I try to believe that if you deal with it that it will get better but too many people end up commiting suicide anyways and i dont think i do anything different then what they do. The closest i got was once day thinking i was going to jump into the ocean at night so no one can see me and just drown myself. Im now probably alot more dramatic about it and think of ways that everyone can see it. Im now in a phase where im looking for attention and i hate it. I hate everything that ive become. I basically see all the things i hate about people growing up and have become all of those. Im pretty sure it has to do with me not wanting to be like my family. I basically dont want to be like them to the point where i dont even spend time with them because i dont want anything about them to rub off on me. Its just that doesnt change that i will be like them and even if i dont like it will always be somewhat like them. Ive had a family history of suicide attempts in my family. Its pretty sad because around everyone i grew up pretty much all of them have tried it. I also dont want to take any medication because i dont think im in a state of mind to really even go thru with it and dont want to be stuck taking meds the rest of my life just to try to be happy or sane.
1609,i want to drag a knife across my wrist and just fade away forever.,"i want to die so bad or i feel like i need to. i just want to be somewhere where people care. instead of whining about what i want im just going to explain the way things are as of now. i feel lonely and unwanted i dont feel important at all. i feel guilty and ashamed of myself. i hate life and it sucks so bad. i dont have anybody to talk to at all and i mean absolutely no one. i cant do this anymore, i just cant. im in hell. everyday of my life is hell, and im in so much pain. please somebody just talk to me im at the end of my rope i need to do something right now. i really dont trust myself anymore, its only a matter of time. im not trying to get attention. i have so many emotions and thoughts running through my mind right now i just need to vent. i want to drag a knife accross my wrist and just fade away forever."
1610,I need help a.s.a.p,"Okay, i might as well start at the beginning…"
1611,Hi. Here's my situation.,"I've kind of been having ""bouts"" of depression and aggravation. Recently (the past month or so), I've been considering suicide very seriously. I haven't attempted it yet, because I want to wait until my death won't hit my family so hard. Right now, everybody's having too much fun doing too many things; I don't want to ruin it. However, I have planned several ways to kill myself and have on several occasions found myself rehearsing slashing/stabbing my carotid artery. I know I could do it and want to do it; but I also want to minimize the damage it does to my loved ones."
1612,My heart is broken and I didn't know him that well,"Well I'm going through a rough break-up, moving my things out this Saturday. Since the break-up I looked for an old friend (who was kinda a hook-up, we weren't super close but had fun times together and he was a friend) on myspace. Basically I found out he had Bipolar Disorder and killed himself in March of this year. I haven't spoken with him since December of 07. I've never had to deal with the death of someone that I've been intimate with... it breaks my heart to know he's gone and that BD killed him. My mom also has BD and has tried to kill herself before while she was messed up on a bunch of pills, and she's been on and off lithium like the guy was. Has anyone else had to deal with an ex's suicide? I cried last night about it, but I just try to think of the good times we had, I know it wasn't his fault, it was that stupid BD. I'm not religious, but I think maybe I'll see him again one day. It was just such a shock to be looking him up to say hey and then find that out, especially since it happened only a month ago... I feel like if I spoke to him sooner I could've helped him."
1613,Is there a suicide hotline like The Samaritans where instead of phoning people you can chat to them,...live on the Internet?
1614,I don't really want to live.,"Hey all... Well, for starters I am about to turn 20. I'm just going through some tough times, and I'm at the stage where I'm debating whether or not I even want to be around. I know suicide accomplishes nothing, except putting me out of misery. I don't want to do it, but I frequently feel that I should."
1615,what is the point ?,I had a very stressfull job with no support from management
1616,"I just want to die after a miserable, creepy life story",I cannot take it anymore.
1617,"its over, rejected not worth going on",OK so she told me for the 3rd time today to just go back to the mainland
1618,i am already dead,i am going to kill myself
1619,"This might sound strange, but I feel suicidal over my dad's girlfriend.","My dad has a girlfriend that he really likes, but says he doesn't get on with and will have to dump her for a number of reasons. But I really love the woman in the same way that I would love a parent, she has been a major part of my life for the past 5 months and I feel that I would kill myself if we lost her. Also I strongly doubt he will find someone else to replace her."
1620,Alone?,"I just don't know why it plays like a record in my head! I have alot going for me. Seems like im different than most people. Im 27 guy considered myself good looking have very nice income. I like tech stuff like computers, movies etc. Im not a nerd nor look like one but in my situation is i can't relate to ppl around me somehow and i feel isolation and this baffles and sends me into spiral of depression with the bottle etc. Ive had many opposite sex relationships but they never work out. i feel empty emotionally but my ambition keeps me from looking back. Im concerned about this. Is there anybody out there that has everything but love and what should be recognized and done!???"
1621,"Feelings and Premonitions, Please - has anyone else felt like this?","Im not suicidal, but i am experiencing a problem at the moment. I have this feeling that just wont go away, this feeling that soon, i am going to die."
1622,"What's a quick, effective way to die?","I'm not here to get you to talk me out of killing myself...it won't work. I've had over two months to contemplate this...and it's going to happen. My life's not heading anywhere, and it's in complete shambles right now...I can barely function, and I just want to end it all."
1623,** just sighs **,"Was doing good... havent cut or burned since i got outa the hospital. Ive wanted to... ive wanted to really bad but i guess the fact that its out in the open and they are looking for it has stopped me, but i couldnt help myslef tonight. Went looking for a lighter and when i couldnt find one resorted to cutting. Why is it never enough ? the second it stops bleeding i gotta do it again and go deeper so it bleeds longer. I just watch as the blood pools in the newly formed slices in my skin and streaks down my arm. My arms stinging now and i actually like it. why do i like the pain so much? dont see my new phyciatrist and counsler for another week or so but i really dont see how its going to help. They just keep throwing more labels on me and more pills at me that really dont help at all. I truly dont see myself ever being happy. im just trudging through each miserably day... living outa guilt. Ive never know any other way of looking at life. Ive never know what its like to feel any other way. Apparently ive been like this since i was around 4. How can talking with some phyciatrists and counselors really change my entire outlook on life. Do i even want my outlook to change? life truly does seem so trivial and meaningless. Whats the point of going through all the misery when were just going to die eventually anyways? Nothing last forever... why not just make that end come alittle sooner? why am i even posting here? Am i really sadistic enough where i need others to know the pain i feel? Am i really so desperate for attention that i need to complain to people i dont even know? guess ill just keep sighing and letting it all run through my head. I could try my distractions like ive been doing. Go get lost in a book or go out with some people but thats what i did today and it only makes my mind race even more. Whats the point ? Now more then ever going out with people feels like more of an exhausting chore then anything else. Ive been labled with borderline personality disorder and social phobia among other things. Ever since this all came out in the open a couple weeks ago i feel like its worse now then ever. Or maybe im just noticing it more. i dont even know anymore. Does it really matter ? I hate being alone but i hate being around people even more...really how should i handle that ? I just want to die... Why wont people just let me be in peace? why is death, as natural as it is, such a horrid thing for people?"
1624,i really really need help,"I just came out of the bathroom from using a #18 IV needle and I just got extremely upset when someone didn't get the message that I wanted to take a shower and hurried me out, even though they, my M-I-law and my husband, have no clue. I really really want to kill myself. I'm a veteran with severe deppression and PTSD but I don't dare ask for help because nobody even imagines what I was planning. I'm a christian and I got really upset because I always say God is never late, but for the first time in a long time I got upset that he used my MIL to let me know he was there and knew."
1625,I'm scared...,Should I be worried if someone who is very depressed says things like these (they were in the context of a discussion about gang violence that led to school shootings):
1626,Curious.,"Recently I've noticed that I've been feeling more and more depressed lately, normally I can act cheerful and pleasant and yet inwardly I feel as though I want it all to end. I understand that people everywhere go through these types of thoughts and yet I am starting to worry. Sometimes I will write suicide notes and wills in my head and recently despite my best efforts I can't seem to find the will to be motivated or find a purpose or joy in my life. I despise people who simple use religion or hot lines as reasons to stop suicidal thoughts and I also have no one I can seriously talk to about this. So I am curious at what I am supposed to do? How am I supposed to fix these thoughts when I can barely get my life in order, many people out there have it much tougher than me and yet I can barely find the courage to plaster on a fake smile anymore. I am starting to resent myself and everyone around me and I don't know what to do. I don't want people to fix my problems...I just was someone to say something that might make my situation just a little bit more bearable. Sorry if this imposes on anyone."
1627,Help,My girlfriend of 5 years has dumped me for me not earning and spending enough! is that right? No its not!!! i did all i could before this but m just because m burdened with financial difficultiesa fter my dad passed away!
1628,Suicide because of others ?,This is more like a general question to all the people around on this subforum.
1629,i dnt understand,"I dnt understand why i keep thinking of ways to top myself. i never stop thnking about it. what can i do, im not 'just not happy' im in pain. my dreams r shattered becus iv failed at school, any nice emotions seem to have gone and my heart is failing to repair and i am really depressed."
1630,cant go on anymore,i just wanna die i just wanna fall asleep and never wake up maybe that is for the best i seem to hurt every one around me people can just live a better life with out me
1631,I can't be suicidal,"I simply don't have the time to be down in my life at the moment. I am not stupid after living almost 18 years on this planet i must have learnt something, like say (you know you can make it through this) THEN WHY AM I STILL THINKING DEATH? I personally dont get it, i bumped into the guy that sexually abused me for years and he grabbed me by the arm smiled, then walked away."
1632,this is it *triggering*,"i am ready to let everything go...my pain, hurt, anger. i want to die, i wish my last overdose did it for me and went longer than 45 seconds without an heartbeat. i want to rip my stiches out in my wrist and cut so deep i hit the artery, i know i can do it and a want to so bad.....i am so freaken messed up...](*,)"
1633,And the point is?,
1634,"My first attempt...foiled by my ""friends""","I'm really disappointed. Two nights ago I tried to overdose on sleeping pills while my friends and flatmates were out clubbing. I locked all the doors, wrote a short note and lay in my bed after downing some pills (don't remember how many). Apparently my mates came home a bit later and were banging on my windows trying to wake me up. Then they called the cops, who broke in along with paramedics. Then I was taken to the emergency department. Ugh."
1635,i want death,i dont knw y m jst adding new threads. i wan death. i cant cope with this life anymore i wana die plz helpm me kiling myself all seem all against me. i dnt want life plz . i am making a will 2 donate my body so that m atleast of use smthin i want a dignified death. lord m coming home
1636,I'm absolutely pathetic,i'm absolutely crushed right now. my best friend has told me how embarrassing i am around people and how she has to apologise for me to people because im so shy and awkward. ive been seeing a physcologist for low self esteem issues and depression and i thought id made some progress this last week. i actually had conversations with people (one being a girl i like) and made eye contact. but its pathetic isnt it. its something ordinary people can do but because im so * * * * ed up looking at it like its progress when its absolutely pathetic.
1637,im bein serious if you stop talkin to me i dont want to live,"I have someone saying these things to me and i dont know what to do, personally i want nothing to do with them, but im so scared of what they might do."
1638,giving up,just feel like giving up its hard living thou darkest hours i feel beaten down low and my self worth takes a beating
1639,My videotape.,"In the past, when I used to feel on the verge of giving up, I had an exercise I would do. I would think about how I would spend my last week, who I would see, what I would do, what I would appreciate for the last time. By the time I was done, I would see everything that way for a while. I would appreciate life as if I would never see it again. The wind blew more peacefully, colors stood out, friends and family were more dear, memories were more fond."
1640,If...,If anyone wants to talk... PM me.
1641,"piled on like a failed levee (or, today I'm dead)","I feel like I'm already dead. I've grown tired of ""having faith in myself"" when the reality of the situation is that my ""self"" sucks. I'm a horrible person; I don't deserve life, or anything great. I don't even know how the hell I ended up feeling entitled to these things 'cause of my never-ending stream of supreme idiocy, stubbornness, bad luck, bad serendipity, manic depression, caffeine addictions, ADHD, masturbation addictions, and all."
1643,It would just be easier.,"I've just been having such a hard time with certain things lately. I've been trying to get into college, and I keep running into obstacles because my parents either didn't do something or won't do something. It's just really wearing on me. I took a gap year, so I don't have a counselor or anyone helping me. It's just me, and I've worked so hard to go to college. I just feel so discouraged whenever I run into snags that don't have anything to do with me. I would hate to not be able to go because someone else didn't do anything."
1644,I see no other way...,"I skipped a final today, think I'm going to skip another one tomorrow . I can't do this anymore. I just want to sleep forever and never wake up.I don't want to be a college drop out, but I just wont make until the end of the semester. I can't concentrate, feel tiered all the time, I just want to sleep. I either feel completely numb or completely depressed. My family will hate me for giving up in college, not that they would ever admit it cause they are too supportive for that. But I know I'm letting everyone down. It seems like it would be better if I stop existing. I just want to close my eyes and never open them again. I had it all and lost it all."
1645,Don't know what to do anymore...,Hey all.
1646,i cant take this pain anymore can sumone please talk to me,pleas im hurting so much i wanna kill myself i juss wish sumone would talk to me
1647,two difficult choices,"This question is for those who are understanding adults. I am undecided on an issue, but ultimately will make my own choice."
1648,My friend was found dead yesterday...,A friend of mine at university was found dead yesterday afternoon. He lived accross the road from me and his housemate came running over to us. He said he found him hanging in his room. He was blue. My friend was a mess.
1649,just feel like giving up,just feel like giving up im just a failure
1650,A Question to Those Who Have Made Attempts,"How did you live with it in the months afterward? How did you overcome the increased emotional pain and sense of failure? How did you deal with having everyone know and look at you differently? If you did something scarring, how do you deal with seeing those scars everyday as a reminder? Please, someone help me through this. There must be another side because I know I'm not the only person who has failed. How did you get there and not just try to finish the job?"
1651,The Time,2/27/2009 ~7:05 PM (5 minutes from post)
1652,Gahh... I can't take this anymore....,I honestly don't know why I'm still alive.
1653,help..... It's to much to handle,Hi all
1654,I want to die when I'm happy! O__O,Hello.
1655,Should I still seek help?,"I tend to have emotional issues. Things in general are pretty good in my life, I have no family issues, I have a close friend, decent grades, a little lacking in the social/dating department, but that's okay. But every now and then I'll have crying spells for no reason and I'll begin to think that I'm worthless and will never get anywhere in my life. I just had a crying spell last night, cried myself to sleep over the fact that I can't think of any talents that I have. It's over obviously petty stuff like that. But it's only every now and then. And on an almost constant basis I fantasize about how it would be if I killed myself, the people that would be at my funeral, and how I would want to be found. But I never get close to do it, I never plan it out, I only think about it, and how it might be. I know my parents and my friend would be upset so I'm sure I would never kill myself. So, should I still seek professional help? I feel most would just say to get over it and think positively. I dunno."
1656,Don't want to live anymore.,Period.
1657,i cant take this pain anymore,"this is very serious i want to kill myself it hurts inside too much , im so alone, no one will ever understand , y did god put me here to suffer i dont wanna b alone anymore i need to cry an talk to sumone nobody ever cares until its too late"
1659,I Think Today Is The Day,"I go home for Spring Break today. I spent most of this not going to any of my classes. I didn't even take a test that was scheduled. I was trying to make myself more resolved by feeling like school won't be worth returning to. As of now, I plan to go home, take off my coat, go to the bathroom and end my life. At the same time, part of me doesn't want this, which is why I'm here. I failed twice be for recently. I feel like I have everything straight now. Someone tell me how stupid this all is. Or don't. I don't exactly know. I just know that in twelve hours I plan to not be here any longer."
1660,I put knives to my wrists but I can't press down,"I have thought about suicide, I have not been happy for a long time. I am never really happy never really excited about anything. I'm just here living life by myself. I don't want to do it anymore. I don't have anything to live for anymore everything gets worse and worse every year, I hate myself for posting online because its what losers do, losers post online to strangers and seek attention to feel better, it doesn't make me feel better, it just makes me feel worse. I hate myself and my mind and my heart and everything. Why can't I just do it I just want to die and feel nothing at all anymore I don't want to feel anything. I guess I'm religious because I think about how I will go to hell if I die by suicide. why am I even posting this, this is a waste of time. im just a big fake in everyting I do"
1661,sick of fighting it,"i guess that subject's right...honestly i dont know what i planned on writing in this space either. i dont want to roll around in self loathing and pity online - im not sure why anyone would want to read some garbage i write about my pathetic life when they have one of their own; and problems theyre struggling with, but for some reason i keep on typing anyways."
1662,ending life very soon...ive made my decision,"i have read some posts from other people and i feel a lot of the same things, i have a hard time putting into words how i feel so other people posts have helped me identify some things. im 21 years old, i have depression, and bipolar disorder which i take medicine for but it never helps , ive been on so many different medications before with all the same outcome. my whole adolescent life was spent in juvie, boot camp, rehab, and mental hospitals. ive had a drug addiction since i was 14. ive been to jail 3 times ,the first time was when i was only 19.now i just cant get away from my horrible life. ive been abused physically mentally and sexually. i never had anybody to talk to my whole life so some of my emotions have been pent up for a long time. none of my friends feel like real friends because im afraid of what they will think of me if i tell them all this stuff. im tired of feeling alone. i feel vey distant and i dont trust myself. if i decide to kill myself i know exactly how im gunna do it, and im very very close to that point right now. ive had attempts in the past but they were only cries for help, now i want to do it the right way. i could just be that 1% whose life is doomed to fail and cause them misery and cant be helped. even if i wanted to call a suicide hotline i cant cuz i dont have a phone. my mom doesnt get home till 10:30 tonite so im alone till then. by the time she gets home i could be long gone. im sorry for everything ive done, im sorry for wasting everybodys time, im sorry for being mean,im sorry for being a failure, im sorry for everything. this world would be better off without me so i cant hurt anyone anymore emotionally. i want my mom to know im sorry and i wish she knew how much i love her. she'll be better off without me. im going to go to sleep and not wake up. thats all i have to say ......thank you for listening"
1663,I am so upset not worth living for anymore,"It has been a long time since I came on here. Well today, I am so upset I looking to make a will and be done with life. For 46 years I have been thru alot and this was the last straw. The last time I felt like this when I was laid off from jobs about 4 years ago and my ex girlfriend. I have had a good job for almost 4 years and now this happens. I HAVE BEEN ACCUSSED OF breaching a firewall at my workplace. I do not even know how to get into the firewall. They were aware that the work computer had issues. Hell even logged into my system at 4a.m a ghost log in and would log me out."
1664,Will you go to hell if you commit suicide?,"I was always taught that a person will go directly to hell if they commit suicide...what do you think? Personally, I think that if you pray for forgiveness before you commit the sin then you should be forgiven."
1665,SUICIDE after break up.....,"I have posted a fair few messages on here, mostly about myself being hurt by being dumped by my girlfriend just over 4 weeks now. Yeah, it still hurts a little but not as much and am feeling much much better than I did when we both split. Time does heal - people dont say this just to make you feel better but they say it cause its the TRUTH."
1666,The chosen one,I'm the chosen one by God.....to screw up my life..and it is so damn screwed up....its a living hell...i hate myself.......couldn't do anything right in my life....Y am i living this sick life.... i don't deserve life because i don't know how to live....i only screw things up...i've had enough....and its going to keep happening........there is no end to it....
1667,"I feel so suicidal, is anybody willing to talk to me?","Feeling so low and hopeless at the moment... Shared with my boyfriend, that a coworker of mine got fired today, same position, same qualifications as me, but he wouldn't even listen to me. I got triggered - I cried for hours, and now still can't come to peace with myself. I'm thinking of biking to the sea, and then just swim, swim as far as I can get."
1668,Going to end it soon.....,"Hi, I'm new here. I find it easier to talk about these things here with strangers then I do with people I know. People I know wouldn't suspect this kind of thing out of me."
1669,Need some help with my thinking,"I'm not suicidal. But sometimes I think of suicide as a way out from my problems. I think...wouldn't it be nice if I could start my life over again? Erase all the problems, erase all the mistakes, erase the hurt parts of my childhood, the hurt parts of me, the painful moments......to redo life?"
1672,sad..... saw my boyfriend kill himself years ago.,"In 2001 my boyfriend killed himself in front of me . It was the day after I broke up with him..... I was involved in an abusive relationship for two years. He was my first ""love"". Anyway, you would think by now I should be functioning semi- normallly... i'm not. I dropped out of college, all i do is sleep or lay in bed. I had to move back in with my mom because I can't go to school or have a job. I'm just so sad. I feel like it all just hit me this past year... This isn't normal..... and it scares me. I don't know what to do... Am I somehow being punished for killing him?"
1673,I Feel the urge to end my life,"First of all I would like to state, I am not an unhappy person. I live an okay life, Yes I suffered abuse as a child, some things a child should not be put through but I went through the leaps and bounds and I have found myself a a happy place I would assume. I have a good paying job, I finished highschool, the first in my family to do so, I have an amazing partner whom I love completely. But...Every so often, about twice a week...I look around or I lay in my bed and think..'I think I should die now.'"
1675,I am scared of myself,I came on here hoping to distract myself. I have been walking around my house like a emotionless zombie. I can't feel and that is enough to drive any hope out of my heart.
1677,Should I tell my boyfriend?,Last Saturday I had the worst day I've had in awhile. I'm going through a lot of stuff with my family where they are hugely disappointed in me and where I'm struggling with overwhelming guilt and anxiety. I think I may be clinically depressed as I have been struggling with these feelings since October.
1678,Now I can see why people kill others and sometimes themselves,"Hello, I am 31. I live pretty much an average life. Except that I never in my entire life had a friend. Even when I was a kid, I remember I was getting bullied and I didn't have friends back then either. I was moved out of parents house to foster house when I was 14 because they were alcoholics. Fortunately, I managed to get high school diploma followed by a few college certificates which helped me get a descent job."
1679,What's worst than failing???,"In the past 4 months I have failed twice. In October I tried and failed and last week I tried again and FAILED! I've realized I need to step out of my comfort zone. I wanted to die in a way that would be comfortable to me but I can't do it right, so I have to do something more severe. Living with the failure is so impossible. To know that you can't even die correctly. Last week, I wound up running from the police for 2 days, because once my family found out what I had tried to do, they tried to have me hospitalized. As much as I don't want to live, I don't want to be imprisoned even more. So, I was homeless for two days. I have no idea where I'm going with this. I just wanted to say it and I can't speak this candidly with my therapist or I'll find myself on the run again. All I have now are scars to remind me of what I failed to do. Everyday I have to wake up and see them. Mocking me. I hate this."
1680,wanna die,i wanna die now the pain is too much ro cope with
1682,i dont know,it is so hard to never be anyones first choice
1683,i dont want to hurt anymore,"Hi i usally deal with stres and pain ok, i play football and run track for my highschool so my emotions are usally dealt with in a healthy way. But recently my girlfriend and i broke up and iam suicidal i have been cutting i have begun to take heavy testosterone boosters which increase your strength but mess with your hormones.. anyways iam so far down i just cant take life without her and she hurt me so bad, i have changed so much and have no hope and stressed about college. please anyone.. who has been so far down they have no hope but climbed out of this hole please please tell me how to move on..iam contemplating suicide.."
1684,please help me,but i need someone to help me
1685,Some Help?,"So, strangely enough, I'm new here. *waves*"
1686,Life Blows,Well everyone kept telling me how my life would get better after my divorce. Today I can prove everyone wrong. I just found out that in a few weeks I am no longer going to spend my weekends with my kids. During the school year I get them every other weekend. Now I will be working on those days. Why shouldn't I just end it now. Sure there will be pain for them for a few years but they are still young and will get past it in time and still live happy good lives. I just don't think I can take anymore crap being dumped on me. One by One every one I know is leaving me and not wanting to be around me. I have hit rock bottom and I see now way to climb back up. This hole is just way to deep now. I have hurt everyone I care about and I just can't take it anymore. It would be easier for them to have just one big pain for awhile and get over it knowing there will be no more.
1687,Not Your Typical Suicide thread...hopefully,"So I sometimes come accross people who cannot understand suicide. Certain people just cannot imagine wanting to kill themselves, and i have come to a conclusion...You can really gauge the severity of pain in ones life by their views on suicide."
1688,"So, you want to kill yourself?","So. You want to kill yourself. I did too. I found myself in a place of darkness and I just wanted to die. My first attempt, I was nine years old. Then I tried again. And again. I have now lost count, but I know it is somewhere over 30. Overdoses, strangulation, cutting, drowning, and you know what? On my last overdose, I was told my heart could stop. That scared me. So. Much. You do not want to die, deep down. It's not all it's cracked up to be. It's scary. It's horrible. It's"
1689,I feel like im goin crazy,I wrote in my last post how i had dark thoughts and some of the time i would end up thinking about killing my ex. I guess to explain it further i was and still am obsessed. I didnt know what i know now about being obsessed so i wish i never was but i cant change the past. Its just being obsessed with your partner makes it really difficult when you break-up. I still to this day cant see myself being with anyone else. Its like completely blocked out. I still have to fight with myself to not do anything stupid because i still want to get back with her. I dont talk to her and really have no desire to because the person she is now isnt who she was when i was with her. Its just doesnt seem like i can get over how she used to be with me. I still am not able to deal with the fact that she has been with someone else. I still dont know how to deal with the fact that even when she is with him she still thinks about me. I know she isnt over me but she cant deal with it. I guess i knew i dont know anymore. I basically did everything i could to make the relationship work. I basically probably ended up doing everything on my own because it seemed like she didnt. I dont even know how to describe it but ill just say all the fights i had to work out between us. I had to basically know her better than she knew herself to know what she was thinking so i could know what she was thinking to figure out how to work things out.
1690,Nothing Unique About My Whine.,"This may be a cry for help, obviously it is if I am posting in a public forum to untold numbers of people. And I know things can always get worse, and could be worse for me, but I hate my life anyways."
1691,Peering over the edge.,Peering over the edge.
1693,i want to just get away...,I want to leave...and get away..it feels like i could just die and no one care... the only reason i dont kill myself now is because of my family and how they 'might' suffer...my little sister especially...she is 4...and like 2 of my friends...
1694,i have a dieases,"Something is wrong with me, and it had caused me to age very rapidly. My skin is in the condition of someone much older than me, literally, and it hurts and bugs me, imagine is someone sucked the hydration from your skin, my skin is falling apart, it has no protection so it really looks like its rotting away."
1695,happiness and lies,I am capable of loving deeply and never have. I want to love someone but every man I become involved with ends up lying or cheating. I dated someone who left me for another girl twice. I also fell in love with my best guy friend who recently contacted me only to tell me that he didn't think we would ever work in a relationship and never call again. Can I heal? Is there still hope? Men come to you when you're happy but I don't know how I can ever be happy again.
1696,Hiding the scars?,"Anyone have any advice on how to hide the scars? I now have a huge, freakish scar on my lower arm, it required stitches and I look like a freak. It's bad enough I can't die, but now I feel like this scar announces to the world that I am such a loser I can't even kill myself properly! I can't do anything right."
1698,Thanks for nothing.,"If you've seen this screen name before, please be aware i'm a different person now. My sister previously owned this account and i took it."
1699,What to do with myself until then ? And how am I suposed to feel about what he does ?,"On and off for the past few years, i have always been thinking about suicide, i tend to go through moments of 'positiveness' and then 'negativeness'. I'm not quite sure if I'm a dramatic, however when I tend to get down, it seems as if its the end of the world, or probably it seems so because when I'm in those moods all the problems I have ever had in my life seem to haunt me. So, I'm guessing when all your problems of your life come up at once, it is o.k. to say it seems like the end of the world ?"
1700,my gun,"wow... where to start. I guess first thing is my gun has been confiscated so, here I am. Still have a bunch of nice hollowpoint bullets. Over a thousand times I have played it out, guess a single edged razor blade to the jugular, femoral, and I'm told below the elbows is a nice fallback, don't know if i'd have the strength to do all that. So why not? I have 3 kids. Their mom is a lying [edit] and had sex with 3 men at least that she admitted to... we're still married (9 yr's) and i've been separated since july. She seems to be dating now and has moved on. I have an apartment the rent is paid but I can't even afford to move into it -- 3 hr's away -- my logistical problems are intense but not insurmountable. I'm just not into anything any more. Living at my mom's house who screams at me at least 4 times a day and I mean like screaming like a real scream no [edit] for nothing - i need to borrow the car for 20 minutes or something, I have a license and don't have accidents, tickets, or anything."
1701,Should I feel bad for my dad if I kill myself,"I had a rough childhood, it was filled with tons of verbal and physical abuse from my family including my father"
1702,Suicidals,How many of you wish to die?
1703,What to do about roommate of only 3 weeks?,"So, last night I picked up my girlfriend from the airport. On arriving back at her apartment we were stunned to find her new roommate of 3 weeks on the floor in an attempted suicide."
1704,Just Trying to Cope,"For the past three months I have been haunted by images of suicide, and feelings to self harm as well as clearly planning how and when I would do it. I suffer with PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder for those of you not in the know) caused by the constant bullying i faced every day before I dropped out of school for home tutoring this has made me cut and think of self harm nearlly every day."
1705,Im unhappy.. Suicidal.,"Yeah hi people, Im André, I'm a 14 years old guy, and my life's really just nohin else than a misery."
1706,I want to sleep and not awake again,"I really don't know what to do, where to escape... I have been unemployed since December 12th and frantically looking for a job since my salary is our only income. I'm divorced and I have a 23-year old daughter. She will go overseas to college in March and she's all I have and we spend as much time as possible together; right now I don't know what bothers me more, if my daughter leaving in a little more than a month, or not having a job. I hope I find a job by the time she leaves, otherwise I will go crazy."
1709,I try to get my life working again,I decided to stop feeling sorry for myself and start to do something.
1710,Yeah hi agan :P,"Sorry everyone, I was quite busy last night xP"
1711,Keep your Head Up!,"Wow, didn't know their was a Suicide Thread...."

1713,This Vicious Cycle Has To End!,"I really, really need help. I'm sure a lot of you know about me since every couple of weeks which lately have been turning into days I get really depressed and post here because I don't have anyone to turn to. To those of you who don't know my story I'll explain it once again in the shortest way possible."
1714,Wish i could go back a few months,My life in the last few months has gone down the drain.
1715,Please help,"Hi,"
1717,"Rhetoric of hope, purpose, and control. Rejection of an inevitable fate.","In all the world, in all that is knowable and predictable, in everything that can be touched, we search for purpose. The pleasures of awareness are tempered with the demand to know why. When the answer is clear, rational, and undeniable, emotion is the gift that allows us to look beyond utility. Love provides the inspiration to not just carry on but to move forward with passion, true appreciation rather than mere acceptance. It transforms a fleeting existence into a series of moments that may each become an eternity in and of themselves. Who you are greatly surpasses what you leave behind or how others remember you because being human is not about standing out. It is about being an integral part of a whole, a body, a community that won’t simply miss your absense but cease to be same without it. While you are here, it’s your world, it’s everyone’s world, a place that can at any instant be shaped through either the passionate will of action or the disinterested glance of apathy. No one who takes a single breath goes unnoticed or unknown. We deceive ourselves with the delusion of beginnings and ends, absolutes and inescapable fates. The only constant, the only inevitable conclusion is that things will change because they must. Although hope may die, the possibilities and probabilities of which it was built never can. The freedom to choose isn’t about controlling what happens next. Choice is about imagining something in front of your eyes that is not there and perhaps never was. Choice is about trying to touch that dream, if only for a second, with the attempt or trial meaning much more than actual accomplishment or failure. Men are inspired less by outcomes than they are the struggles that precede them. Die if you must but fight like hell before you do."
1718,Not Going To Be Here Much Longer,"Im new to this forum and I figured I'd make a last ditch effort to try and get some opinions and input from some people, even though it probably won't do much to change my mind at this point. I'll give you a quick run down on how ive got to this point and the way im feeling."
1719,Loneliness to the extreme,"I really can't take it anymore. When I was 16 my mom died from lung cancer, so a couple months later i tried to kill myself, i couldn't take the pain. My sister was a drug addict. I turned my life around after going to a psych ward, a year later I turn into a heroin addict, JUST LIKE MY SISTER. I go to rehab and meet a girl that I completely fall in love with regardless of what they tell you about rehab romance, she doesn't feel the same way about me, she's got a kid, moves back in with her babys daddy. I was living in a sober living house and I moved back home and ended up getting high again. I don't really think it had much to do with her but more to do with me hating myself. She has contacted me through email telling me she still cares about me even though her babys daddy won't let her talk to me. This douche calls me threatning to kill me and * * * * if i don't stop talking to her. For some reason these past 3 weeks since i've moved home, I don't want to do anything, I dont even care about life. I've been staying sober only because my dad took all my money cuz he found track marks on my arm. I'm only 19 years old, but I feel hopeless I can't find the will to want to live, I think about ending it everyday, I can't deal with doing nothing everyday. I would love to talk to a therapist or a psychiatrist but i got dropped from my dads insurance because im not a student. I'd love to get a job but I'd rather sit here and stare at a wall all day. I really want to end it, I have nobody who can understand what i'm going through and nobody to talk to, I can't ask my dad for help again hes put my sister through rehab multiple times and me through institutions twice. I know it could be worst but i can't pick myself up, someone please help."
1720,It's an odd feeling knowing the end is coming.,"I've thought about it for a long time and finally got myself ready for it. The moment is coming quickly, and I'm honestly unsettled by the fact that I'm still feeling nothing about it. I'm sure I'll be overcome soon enough with the realization that I'm not going to be around anymore, but at this point I still think of tomorrow and things I need to do. Unless I talk myself down tomorrow though there is no help. Everything is in order."
1721,homestay guy in our house commit suicide-crazy,he was introduced to us by my uncle's friend of a friend. and my moms loves extra income and we had a extra room in our house. so we agreed and it was close to his school too
1722,Why wont I kill myself?,Age 0-24 stuck in psychological tormented hell
1723,Does It Matter What I Type Here ?,"Ok...If you think your life sucks, mine will make you feel better about yourself. I have been alone for most of my life, not lonely, but alone. I have never found the right woman, but I have at least tried. For various reasons, some my fault some not, each relationship didnt work out. I consider myself ok looking, not ""handsome"" but not ""unattractive"" either, decent shape, etc. The most normal guy you will ever find. Highly intelligent, but not highly educated. I have no family whatsoever, and a limited amount of friends. I have tons of acquaintances, but a limited amount of true friends."
1724,Hopeless...,"I'll start this post with a little background information. Growing up, my dad was a mean, sometimes violent, always emotionally/verbally abusive alcoholic. When he wasn't completely sauced, he was a fun, likeable guy which left me torn between hating him and believing his harmful drunken rants. He met my mom in a foreign country and brought us to the States when I was around 4 so she had no family or friends at this time. They divorced when I was 7, but my dad continued to see me, pickinig me up on some weekends. I was terrified, still am terrified of him to this day. My mother has always been unavailable, favoring parties and time with her friends/boyfriends over me. Being an only child, my childhood years were very, very lonely. My mother often depended on me for emotional support, which bothered me, but the fact that it bothered me made me feel guilty."
1725,I just don't know,Hello everyone...
1726,I'm giving up,"I think it's coming down to a matter of days for me now. I don't have the energy or will to continue on any longer. I feel as though I'm a fool and that the things I feel led to do don't matter. (such as helping others, changing their worlds, shining a light) I suppose it's my own fault that I've gotten into this position, but I have saved peoples lives before and I don't understand why there's no one around to help me. The people who know me don't know what to say and the people who do say something are insensitive jerks. I'm thinking about downing a bottle of booze and sleeping pills somewhere that my roommate won't have to stumble accross my body. If anyone has anything to say, feel free. But pedantic b.s. won't really make any difference and will probably solidify why I feel the way I do. I guess what I really need is a miracle."
1727,Read this & Reply with help,
1728,Will this be read?,"I've read a few threads here, after Googling things such as ""I want to kill myself"" and ""I don't want to live anymore"", and I figured I'd throw my own story in, if you can call it a story. I am suicidal, I am deeply depressed and I have been for a very long time. I have no friends left, I've no confidence and I hate myself. I've lived somewhat, but I am ashamed. I am ashamed of how my family and past friends view me (particularly how they would view me if they knew the whole story), and most of all I am ashamed of my own self and how I view myself. I have no excuse. There is no excuse for my depression and for my pathetic apathy and lack of dignity. I am 21 years old and all of the friends I've had are out together having fun, getting laid, meeting people, etc. And I am at home, with absolutely no interest in embarking on what would be such a pointless endeavor. All I remember is feeling alone my whole life, and being treated like less of a person. I have completely lost the will to live, and every day throughout my night dreams and day dreams I feel more and more capable of ending it all. I have been thoroughly depressed for as long as I can remember, perhaps longer, and over the past few years I have learned to hide it completely. I am more alone now than I've ever been in my life."
1729,ready to go need some advice,I'm all ready to get out of this hell whole called life. Anyone know a good way that doesn't involve a big mess or alot of suffering? I don't really need any help just idea's on how to roll out
1730,Suicidal,"Married for 25 years. I am wildly in love with my wife. We havent had sex for two years. 18 months ago she stoped sleeping with me. She told me she needed some space and that I was smothering her. Truly, I called her at lunch and in the evening to talk. Our children had just left the nest and I invisioned us growing closer with more time togeter. I complied and stopped calling her. She has always had low grade mental illness and I thought/think this has something to do with it. She was angry all the time for little things mainly with me (I scraped the sidewalk with the lawnmower and she went ballistic). I got very sick and could bairly walk up stairs and was out of circulation for about six months (although I worked every day). I have tried very hard to be a good husband for these last 20 years. Early in our marrige I was unfaithful and I have lived ever day in deep remorse. I do most all the cooking, yardwork and clean up around the house. I make $500K and give every penny to her then ask for $20 if I need it. I am gentle and nonabusive, considerate and pasionate. I am told that I look like Mike Douglas. While I was sick she had an affair with one of my employees. She claims she was drunk and it was (I caught her having sex) a one time deal. I believe that it is likely true although i found out she had been calling this guy on the phone at 2AM and talking for TWO hours. This woman is the streightest arrow I have ever known. This is so unlike her and I know her not to be a lier that I am trying to believe her and get over it. However, she still wont sleep with me or hold my hand. She claims that she is so angry at men that she cant. Sometimes she cries the cry I have known for 28 years that is her cry while going off of the deep end/loosing it. I love this woman and would cut my arms off for her but I am so hurt. I waffle about every 15 minutes with killing myself. Around everone else she acts ""normal"". Around me I see the darkness. I dont see an end in sight. She wont go to counceling. Im beginning to loose it. I cant stand not to have her affection. She sleeps in the other room. I left her but she cried for me to come back. I did but still no physical contact. Im loosing my mind and am beginning to bang my head against the wall etc. I was never this way. I have no friends or family. She is all I have and want. She claims that she bottled up my affairs for 20 years and is just now dealing with them. This is very crule. Almost 2 years alone. Please, what do you think? I am so lost. I bought a gun and had planned to kill myself on christmas day in front of her but she was so kind to me that day that I had a change of heart. Please ladies what is going on in her mind? She wont talk. Her attitude is that if I can just be cool and wait someday it might be alright. Im trying but as time drags on Im geting worse. Ive seen doctors and Im on medication but its not working. There is no medicine for a broken heart."
1731,Empty. Low.,I feel so empty and hollow. So low. I see no point in the future. We die anyway. What's the point?!
1732,Hi again.,"Ha ha, I post a lot eh."
1733,Third Time's the Charm,"So, in October I tried and failed. I got held in the hospital long enough to lose my resolve but not my desire. I tired to walk the path to ""recuperation"" but a month later I set a new date to cast off. I told myself, that if I could find just one reason, one thing to hold onto I'd not do it, but nothing has happened. Nothing positive anyways. My life has progressively got worst. So, December 30th is the next leaving date and I've got nothing. Best of all, this time, I'll be totally alone so I won't have the problem of being found before I'm totally gone. My one regret is that my mother is going to end up being the one who finds me. I really didn't want it to be her. The last time I tried to make so my brother would find me and take care of things before my mother got home but he found me a little too early. *sigh Well, life you've got 6 more days to prove to me you're worth it. Will it be a Christmas miracle, not likely. I'm going to be totally alone then and pretty much everyday until the end. Sounds appropriate."
1734,numbness,Lately I have felt like I have no desire whatsoever to make a difference in this world. What do I mean by that? I have no desire to use the gifts and talents that the Lord gave me. I have no desire to leave my mark in this world.
1735,Need Help,"I need help. I am 14 years old, my name is Jeff and I have constant thoughts of death, suicide, harming myself you get the point. I have brothers that both do drugs. I have a drug problem myself I would like to fix, I smoke marijuana daily I take hallucinogenics, pills and I drink. I don't want to tell my parents because they would flip and my dad would probably beat me. I would like to sober up once and for all even though I'm only a freshmen in highschool. but this is only one of my problems. I am a failure at school, my best grade is a 73 in math. I have a term paper that was due before break I still haven't turned in. I told my mom about my thoughts long ago and she took me to a psychiatrist. I've been going for a year now and still haven't gotten better. I've had girl friends but they all think I'm gay for some reason now. I don't know where to go or what to do. I have friends and a lot of people like me but I don't like myself. I wish I wasn't me I guess, I'm thinking of killing myself but I don't want to hurt my family or my friends. I'm thinking of just taking all of my older brothers oxycodones' and overdosing on them, it would be painless and I would probably enjoy the feelings I have from it."
1737,all my dreams are gone,"since I was in high school I've always wanted to get married and have a family. but here I am -- gonna be 30 and still living with mom (she's poor, I m poor and she has health problems) -- can't get a girlfriend at all, on or offline and has the worst luck with women ever! -- not even in the field that i went to school for -- I have an extreme bitterness towards women -- all of my friends have girlfriends or are married and have kids. --my only brother isn't involved in my life -- can't even get laid all of my hopes and dreams are gone..so why live anymore"
1738,Murder/Suicide,"lets say people helped you be in the situation you are in and you had no choice but to kill yourself, would you kill the people who helped kill you? Lets say you have physical problems you are just unable to live with, this is my current dilema, I really wish I didnt have to go this route but I dont think I have a choice, I cant go on in the shape I am in, just impossible being 29 years old and never really living a life"
1739,death seems like the only logical option,"ok so basically my life sucks. an outside person looking in would most likely say they would love to have my life. i live in a good house, i've got a great dog a pool in the backyard its in a nice neighborhood, i've got a beautiful girlfriend that loves me i'm not horrible looking, i've got both my parents still together and they take care of me and my brothers."
1740,Help!!,"I don't know what to do I want to die so badly but for some reason I can never go all the way through with it no matter how many times I try to kill myself. I feel like I'm a disappointment to everyone, I feel like I'm just a big mistake. No matter where I am I can't be happy, no matter how hard I try to smile I can't. Nothing has any meaning anymore I go through life in a comatose state kind of sitting on the line of the living and the dead. I cut myself so i can feel something but that just leaves marks to prove that my problems are real. I don't know what to do it's just too tireing to keep this up. I just want to give up, I long for the day that I may start to enjoy my eternal peace."
1741,So miserable.,"I just feel like I cannot go on anymore. It seems like any contact that I have with a girl that I like always ends in heartbreak. I feel so lonely and things seem so hopeless now. Im tired of being heartbroken and alone, and it seems like when I try to get out of this pit of hurt in my heart, it just returns in force. I'm not depressed, I know that much, I just feel like Ill never find a woman who loves me, so why go on."
1742,hard 2 keep going,Im just ranting I dont expect ne 1 to care but I really cant see a point 2 living no more.
1743,N o Family No friends and No life... I'v had enough,Can't cope any more. I have no family and no friends..... It's just me and my cat... How sad is that. It's been like this for years and i've tried to make friends but I'm shy and I've now had enough. I have a great house and material possessions but no love life or laughter. I'm done with it all!!
1744,"Depressed, need professional help, suicidal",I'm 27 and my bf of five yrs broke up with me because he didnt want to be in a relationship anymore.
1745,Am I evil,Am I evil?
1747,I so had enough!,"I had enough of it all.. there's nothing positive in my life right now. Work, money, health, happiness, friends, love, everything! I get up in the morning and go to a job I don't love doing, spend time with somewhat wonderful people and no matter how hard I try, I just don't fit in. I feel like people don't even want to look at me, it always started out just fine but afterwards things tend to f'up all the time. I thought, well maybe it's where I was, who I was. So I tried to change it all but now I realized, it's not them, it's me. I've tried for 3 years, I'm tired of trying and I just want to give up. But then something always show up just before I throw my hands up and restored my faith again by a little bit, and it goes away. Do you ever feel like you're a cure-all medicine? I do, whenever people have some problems, some little pain, everyone wants you, once the pain is gone, nobody wants to keep on taking that medicine....... well that's me. My life has no meaning, I looked for the positives, and I can't really find much. I am always misunderstood about things I say, said or will say. Everyone hates me and I don't know why. The thoughts of going to a shrink and pour my heart out terrifies me. I can't afford it anyway.... all who to used to be my best friends either disappeared or moved to other countries. If I'm so great at understanding and helping other people in their tough times, why is my life so miserable and my existence is meaningless.. if I pass will anyone even care, will they even know? I had it, I had enough of a life like this. Professional help? I don't even know if I'll have any money in 2 weeks time. What's going on? Why? I'm normally very together, but right now nothing makes any sense and the idea of sleeping forever is so appealing. There's a normal, decent, kind and caring person inside me somewhere I'm sure, but why can't anyone see? I really don't know how I will get through this, but I guess I will, maybe."
1749,Why can't I just die?,"I've been on here before, everyone promised me that things would get better. Well they didn't and became not only severely depressed but so obsessed with killing myself that nearly every second of the day was consumed by wishing to be dead. I would drive to work and it would take all my strength not to wreck my car. At work I'd be cruising suicide boards looking for what I call ""deathspiration"". No one understood me and I essentially pushed everyone away. Well Friday, Nov. 21 I was on a one stop mission to end my life. I remember driving home, the day so beautiful and I just hated the fact I couldn't even enjoy it because I knew I was going to be dead. I bought my favorite dinner, loaded up on enough alcohol for days, and proceeded to go home and carry out my plan. I won't say exactly what I did because I won't encourage suicide methods, but my roomate walked in on me just in time and took me to the hospital. I was admitted to the psych ward and barely conscious as I basically Baker Acted myself into the system."
1750,Thanks and a suggestion for those on the brink,"Edit: I should add that I am a 23 year old male, recently graduated from college, unemployed, and moderately OCD."
1751,I don't see the point in living anymore,"Hi, I know this sounds really weird, but how do you kill yourself painlessly and quickly? I opted for this path because I dont see the point in living anymore. All my friends are mad at me and I made two of them cry and I am a horrible person for doing that so and everyone at school is mad at me for that and I really just want to end this sad painfull life, so please help me by telling me how."
1752,:(,"I am so unhappy with my life. I can't remember the last time something good happened to me. I feel like I will never be the person I want to be: never get back into shape, never find a boyfriend, never be able to trust others."
1753,what do you do when you have no support?,"I have a pattern of falling into depression. it happens all the time, i get over it and a few months later i am down in the dumps again. I have trust issues and have only talked to a few people about my situation. When i am depressed, thoughts of suicide always enter my mind. I am a very impulsive person, so i dont think before i do anything. out of the friends i have told, i am not feeling any support. the feedback i get is that i am just going through something and i need to get over it, or i want attention. Those people once told me that they would be there for me whenever i needed them and now they are walking away. The other two people i told, i am unable to contact since they joined the airfoce. I dont know what to do. I live with people i once thought were my best friends and now i feel like i am just nothing. i try so hard to keep my thoughts away from suicide but how do you get over this when the poeple who are supposed to be there for you arent?"
1754,I'm Broken,"I will never be okay. I'm alive on the outside and dead on the inside. Mr. Zombie isn't just a screen name. It describes me to a T. I'm a hollow, soulless shell of a person. I died a long time ago. I'm just a zombie now. There is motor activity, but no life underneath. I wish I could end it."
1755,"Have you ever felt like you dont deserve to live,or to be loved?","As the title say,have you ever felt like that?I feel that a lot.Because of various reasons.Like for example,I hate girl for having sex(talked about this in another thread,so dont ask me to explain)and because I hate them,I started for a very long time to believe I dont deserve to have a gf or to make sex."
1756,Cant talk to anyone else,"I apologize in advance for the length of this post. I am using this opportunity to express all the emotions that have been pent up inside me for years. It may be a little too much detail but I want to fully describe my past and current emotional state of mind to either be helped by or connect with others in a similar mental state. I can't talk to anyone else in my life about my true emotions and thoughts without being judged or told ""everything will work out in the end"" because that is all family and friends can say to try and help you feel better. This is the only place I can express my feelings openly and with others who either share or have gone through the emotions I have right now in my life."
1757,Suicidal thoughts,"Just posting in this particular forum section makes me think. I don't know if this is way out there, or I'm just strange, or life is hitting me quite hard. I'll give background information, my writing style is not the best so please put up with it."

1760,Bye,Ijust had a fight with my father because i have problems at school.He told me that I am a looser and I wont do anything in my life.He also made it very clear that he hates that i am his son.My mother told me she regrets that she gave me birth.
1761,In your teens,Is there anyone on this forum that thought on his teens that he will never have a gf or have sex?
1762,Should I be worried or is this normal,"I have a younger brother who is 14 years almost 15. It seems that over the course of the last year or so he has developed what I consider a very bad attitude about things. On the phone or in chat with people he always refers to himself as worthless, ugly, etc. Some times he even remarks that life isn't worth living or stuff of that nature. It has recently gotten bad and I get sick of it personally. He has an online g/f and when I read stuff like 'if you shoot yourself i shoot myself' (we don't actually have any guns) it really pisses me off. He says 'you don't get it. you don't know anything about romance'. Is that really 'romantic'? Seems to me girls don't really like the guys that are down on themselves all the time. And seems to me the girls he is dating may have some form of depression issues themselves."
1763,Why shouldn't I kill myself?,"A while ago I said that even if I had two suicide attempts,I wont try again."

Only good news is that my dad's found a girlfriend, but we suspect she is cheating on him. Is there a way out of this s**t other than death?"
1771,I am lost,"I am so lost in life right now. Everything seems so pointless for me, I feel so indifferent to everything. I feel like I am trapped in life, I am stuck in a job I hate and I have to live with my parents because my job doesn't pay enough for me to live on my own. I think about suicide alot, I think ever since high school, I've always played with that thought in my head. The possibility seems so sweet in my head, to be finally free from all this. Don't know if I'd actually do, but I know that I do think about it a lot and it makes me sad, that I was a coward that wanted to just run away from my problems. Well ENA, any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading my post and letting me vent."

And I really don't have anyone to talk to. I'm 29 years old, and I started my company way too young. It now has so much debt that it is completely paralyzing. The burden of keeping it going has proven to be so much, that I am not trying to end this phase of my life, shut the company down, and go on with my life. Ha."
1782,Free-floating depression,I have a few good friends and my career is in decent shape but I am utterly miserable all the time.

1784,I've had enough. I'm so lonely.,"I'm so tired of 'life' and I just want it to end. I'm 29 and I have no friends. I quit my job this time last year and went to Oz as a last attempt at doing something worthwhile and it was a bit lonely but a good experience at the time. My one best friend then also travelled at the same time and we met up out there but he came back in July and moved to the city. I came home mid September and have been trying for jobs up there but not getting anything. I've been back 3 months and my 'friend' has only got in touch twice during that time just to ask for a book back! I've just seen on his Facebook that he's been to Amsterdam for a few days with a couple of friends and I didn't even know that he was going let alone be asked. He's moved on and met new people and even though I've known him for 9 years, I've been pushed to the sidelines for better people. In my old job I tried to socialise with my work colleagues but because I'm reasonably quiet and not a drinker I was excluded and the guys used to go out and not invite me or go out during the weekend and I'd find out all about their hilarious anecdotes on the Monday which made me feel utterly worthless. I was asked out on a Saturday night by a couple of guys I got to know through my friend but I was a bit quiet and I haven't heard from them since and have stopped being invited. I am so lonely. I loathe New Years - the past decade I've spent two in the company of someone, the rest I'm on my own close to tears sitting in my house while my parents are off with their friends celebrating. I can just imagine all the people I know partying and laughing with their friends and I'm just on my own. I arrived back from Oz in September and I came back to silence. My parents greeted me in the airport but there were no text messages or calls saying 'You've been gone 8 months, great to have you back, night out to catch up' etc as there is no-one. I felt so sad. I've got no job, no friends and no life just wandering around the house seeing all my youth - my 20's just gone under a load of misery. Even a couple of people I met in Oz I've e-mailed and have had no response. I just want to end it - no-one wants to know me apart from my parents but I haven't even got the guts to kill myself. It hurts so badly inside."
1785,some one help me,"I have just lost my job, and Im trying to sell my house when the prices are falling so fact, im trying to find a new one but its no good, my world is falling apart, I have a wife and kid and all I wont to is hide, Im been to the doc and have been taking antidepressants for 2 weeks and sleeping pills every night to sleep. All i keep thinking of is going to sleep and never wakeing"
1787,"Goodbye, Everybody","Everyone always tells me that I have ""so much"" to live for... I don't see it. All I see is a life of pain, perhaps dulled over time, but always returning whenever something reminds me of all the things that have gone wrong. Whenever I'm by myself, I'm lonely and crave companionship, but whenever I'm around people, I just want them to leave me alone... I'm tired of playing this sick twisted game called Life. I'm tired of things finally looking up, only to be dragged down even farther than they were before. I'm tired of trying."
1788,Should I let her do it?,I have been planning on killing myself for a while but a friend of mine wants to videotape it .. I guess to put on the U tube or somethin .. should I allow this or is it too macabre?
1789,I Cried Tonight,"I'm trapped again. I only live for my kids. A fallout is about to happen because I can't hold it together at work anymore. I have to drop out before I make a huge mistake, accidently hurt someone and get fired. In the meantime, I get that pissy, annoying husband nagging at me every day and I can't stand it. I want to hide and to get away. I'm left with no energy to properly engage my kids, who are so fun and sweet. They don't deserve this. I don't want to dump any garbage on them. I hold it in and think about how I need to keep holding it in until maybe a year after my youngest graduates college and becomes established, and both kids, as they should, move on in their lives. It will be lonely for me, but it's the right thing for them. I just fear that I will have no purpose left and will be seriously suicidal. If I didn't have them now, I may have left myself to quietly starve to death alone. No one would check on me if I were divorced and quit work. I've never had a happy break in life. Child abuse, I was just an annoying extra kid in the way, growing up in a cult religion then realizing that god is not real, suddenly dead boyfriend when life was turning up, abusive husband, abusive divorce, struggle to go to grad school on my own and support my kids, no money for heat or food for a while, string of getting used and abused by more men, antidepressants didn't work, settling for a ""safe"" husband who is now pissy and nagging, stressful, exhausting work in an environment where I can't do anything right, and guilt at not having enough of myself to give my deserving children. I want to just give up. I want to check into a mental hospital, but my children will be marked and scarred and my ex will have to begrudgingly become reinvolved in my children's lives and have more reason for criticism of me. There's no way out, so I'll just drink to take the edge off, disengage from the world, keep trying to give what I have left to my kids and wait it out until my kids move on. Then the scary, redeeming time of relief might happen. Maybe I'll crash my car in a tree so my kids won't be hurt by the idea of suicide and guilt of not helping. I don't want them to know anything. I just want to be free and I want to set them free. I must drag them down and I can't barely help it. These are the desperate, panicky thoughts that choke me. I'm very quiet and almost didn't send this, but I just need to let this out and be heard so I can hang on another day."
1790,I don't see much point in carrying on.,"I have so many problems. After throwing everything I had, emotionally, at this girl I love and hoping she'd be with me, she rejected me. I feel worthless, a loser, and I don't have any hope for life. I'm not happy at university and I have very few people I can count on. My step-dad was in a car accident and is now disabled, and the pressure on my mum is now enormous, but I'm so far away I can't help. I get paranoid and have anxiety attacks a lot. Life is so horrible for some people. Why exist?"
1791,Would you if you were horribly disfigure!!!!!!!,
1792,This forum has gotten to me,"I happened to read a post in this forum because it was on the new posts page. Well, I then proeceded to read the others, and let me tell you, it really breaks my heart to see so many people that just want to end their life. I was reading all these posts, and i really wished i could just wave a magic wand and make everything better for everyone...but I cant but it has gotten me really emotional and upset. I like to help people. when I was younger, I wanted to be a child psychologist but it never panned out. Anyways, for those of you who are suicidal, depressed, cutters, whatever; if you want someone to talk to you can PM me anytime. If I can help even one person, then I will be happy."
1793,"some ""cure"" lyrics (I love the Cure)",Sometimes there's nothing to feel
1794,I.....,"I just want to die... I have a feeling I will die soon, if not from suicide, then from some other means."
1795,Maybe a partial solution to my problem,"Hi.I know that my last thread was kinda rushed and I said that I can't take it and I will kill myself,and about an hour later I changed my mind."
1796,Stuck in hell but not suicidal,"What I am feeling is worse then death, and there is no way out, I dont know how to get out of it but I know I will have to, I dont think I will kill myself, but I dont know how to get out of this"
1797,Just pray that I get accepted into nursing school,Because if I do I'm dunzo. Seriously.
1798,My real stupid problem,"So,I avoided to say this all until now,but this is the main reason that drives me to kill myself.I have mentioned about it in another thread,but I kept it basic among others then."
1799,Life is overrated,"great words from snoop dogg, ""life is a bi*ch and then u die."". So far this has been true to me. Nothing brings me pleasure, i feel empty, worthless, some people may call it depression, but im just saying it how it is. Im being honost with myself. The only thing preventing me from dying is because it would crush my moms heart. It is considered ""selfish"" to take my own life because I am hurting the few people who actually care about me. Well when am i going to start doing things that r better for me and not for other people. The good in life doesnt outweight the bad so whats the point. Sure life can be great if ur smart, good looking, charismatic, charming, hard working... but im none of these things. For me, i have already passed the prime of my life, when i was a kid. Not a care in the world i could just have a good time, not worry about money, girls, careers, school, me... those days r long gone. I am 19 and life has been worse every day. Whats the point of living this bad life if ur just going to die anyways. Why not speed up the process? Because I am going to burn in hell if I kill myself?? Well, i dont believe and god, and if he is real, then he is cruel and i wouldnt want to be in his presense in heaven. I just dont know what to do anymore, I could change things, but it just doesnt seem like its worth the trouble. Once i fix my current problems which will take a long time and will be a terrible process, im just going to have more problems to deal with. Its a never ending cycle, until u die at least. So y not die now? I wish i was never born... i was an accident anyways so maybe i wasnt supposed to be here."
1800,Adios,"Okay,I tried to kill myself and I failed.Now I am in hospital.I am thinking to kill myself after I get out,and this time I wont fail."
1801,Too difficult for anyone to handle,"I have driven everyone away with my depression. I have been depressed since I was 10. I am nearly 40. I cry all the time, everyone is sick of me."
1802,Feeling so..Helpless,"Unfortunately, i am having bitter bouts with depression. The thoughts that are running through my mind aren't so good. There are thoughts about suicide running back and forth and their are times where i actually want to."
1803,Ahhh,"Maybe it helps me, if i post here. I doubt it, but everything is posible. People here trying to help and i like it."
1804,fading fast,"well, at this very moment i feel kinda numb, like I'm sinking down and there's nothing to hold me up, almost like I've split into two pieces... one part being my body and one part being my cold already dead feeling soul almost like an out of body experience.... i feel that if my body choose to do something... I couldn't stop it because I have already faded past the point of returning to it... but the strange thing is... nothing happened to make me fell this way that i am aware of... and i'm just wondering if anyone else feels this way?"
1805,Do I accept?,"My son, who I started another thread about, in Parenting & Families, basically wants to die. He has been like this since he was about 14 and it got worse after last weekend's incident-he got arrested, spent the night in jail, released himself on a bond and now is at home with me."
1806,i want to go home,"k, not one to be short winded, ask me the time i will tell u how to build a clock, so this may be a long one. not really use to being alone. nvr have been. really weird after 43 years but what can i say. realized to night after some drink and a long very cold walk that is not the alone that bothers me, it is the empty. not sure when this occurred. think it was early. dad died when i was young. can rem when i was somewhere around 10 or 11 laying on the couch and closing my eyes and seeing how he must have felt with the trees towering over him, the world seen thru a grey tent. the world kept going, while he stayed still. he was watching the world pass by. i didn't want him to be alone. would lay on the couch and wish i was with him. well time has passed by. have been through a marriage of 10 years with 3 children, a relationship immediately after that yielded 2 children. ages of all 15,13,11,10,8. trying to finish my second marriage now, in the final troughs of divorce. no children with this most recent one. which brings me to the moment. i really dont like it here anymore. think back i haven't for a very very long time now. first time in my life i have lived alone but realized only minutes ago it is not the alone so much as the empty. and i really dont wish to be filled, just crushed and thrown away. not something i would ever do myself. got 2 many ppl that depend on me. i dont like to let ppl down. as a reflex i reach out to ppl, not sure y. strangers, friends, it doesnt matter and i have no choice in the situation. if i find someone it true need i Have to do what i can to help. but i dont like it here anymore. really wish i could go now. only choice 4 me is to pray i could be taken now but i cant leave my kids again and dont think the prayer would be answered anyway. none live with me. so im really stuck. i have no idea how i got here! i just really want it to end. tired of hurting, it gets old. would b dif if i could see some light, or see a turn i could take. but its really dark here right now, no light shining thru. been here for a bit now. been a long time since i was somewhere that felt like home. really dont care where it is, i just want to go home!"
1807,my friend tried to commit suicide on sunday,"hey, this is my first post, i dont want to talk to my friends about this as it will lead back to the person in question."
1808,It's been a long time since I've felt this way..but I wanna just die,"I'm nearing 30, next year. I'm pretty much still single. I've tried to change my look. All of my friends have girlfriends and seem to be happy. I still get told I'm unattractive by women and it seems like all of the one's I like are taken or live thousands of miles away or the ones that are thousands of miles away can't handle the distance."
1809,So I had this idea...,I won't go into my past or my reasons or my depression. You can ask me personally if you're really interested.
1810,This is so scary,"It's bad enough when somebody is trying to hurt you, but you can still hide from them. It's a lot worse when it's your own brain trying to harm you...There is no place to hide..."
1812,Black,"it's all I can see. People, things, matter, energy...theyre all strings...vibrations, I can see them now. Iam me and I am not in this world. we are separate entitiles."
1813,I can't sleep..I think I'll die!,"I have no idea what is going on! I can't go to sleep without thinking that I'm going to die! I really feel so horrible. I can't shake it. Every time I drift off to sleep, I wake up all frantic and just scared!"
1815,What's the point?,"So I came to the stark realisation today that if something were to happen to me, that no-one would even notice that I'm gone. I have nothing, nobody thinks about me, nobody would miss me. What's the point in carrying on?"
1816,feel so low,want to die right now
1817,does fear count?,"I don't know why I feel the way I do. I have a good life. I'm so confused. my parents say i'm too spoiled to be depressed. I'm not exactly the good kid in the family, and kind of the black sheep. Some people say I must be depressed because of the type of music I listen to, because it's depressing. I find that music is the only place besides, writing and my dreams, for me to escape."
1818,"new to this, just need to talk i guess","hello, i just found this site. where to start??? ive always felt some kind of urge,or want, to end my life. as of now most of the feeling comes from my situation in life. im currenty married but because of my mental diagnosis, i had to move back in with my parents. that was a huge step back for me. i think that my wife is ok with it though, she seemed pretty unhappy with the marriage since ive been diagnosed. i some times wonder if shes happy its like this, or if shes planning a divorce. its a cluster F*@$. my diagnosis is bipolar1, not that big of a deal consitering that almost half of the US goes through this disorder in one way or another. however it does mess me up alot, especially when you add that to my social anxiety and paranoid delusional percetions. just trying to find new ways to deal with all of this makes me want to throw in the towel. it feels like i have the weight of it all on my back, and plus i have to find a way to make it all work. i cant even figure out what to put on in the morning, how do i solve al those problems too? it gets me so worked up sometimes that i end up doing somthing stupid. i have over 19 burn marks on my body, believe me im not proud of any of them. its embarrassing i dont swim anymore or take my shirt off. i dont know why i feel the urge to do it, but when i get really low or in a mood it seems to just happen. i guess i see it like, no one else cares so why should i. i hate it the most when i get tired and know im going to fall asleep, because i know that all my dreams are going to be about horrible things or, they tease me killing me slowly, slowly. then bam im awake. i hate sleep the most. i think that every person has the right to do what they want with their body, mind and soul. its up to them to do what they want with it, so how can anyone else make that decesion for them. i just dont get it i guess."
1819,I failed,"A bout a month ago I tried to kill myself but before I died my brother found me and I found myself in the hospital. I can say that sometimes things just aren't meant to happen. I planned out my death, seemingly perfectly and still failed. What I did learn is that no matter how anyone thinks killing themselves is going to be, it's likely going to be far more intense than you though. It was absolutely terrifying and I really had to sit and work up the courage to actually do it. Now that I've tried and failed I find I face a world of other problems I wasn't expecting to face. I have to begin to rebuild myself financially because I blew through a lot of money the weekend before. I've had to face my family and explain things to them. *sigh I'm not even sure why I'm writing this. I guess I just felt I should share it."
1821,close to giving up..,"i don't think i'm going to work tomorrow. i'm not going to call off, i just won't show up. i hope they fire me."
1822,I'm sorry I messed everything up. I've been EXTREMELY stupid and insensitive. I'm sorry.,I'm sorry I messed everything up. I've been EXTREMELY stupid and insensitive. I'm sorry.
1823,the beast,"hi, some of you may know me from being around here before. The thing is the"
1824,The coward's way out,"Hi,"
1826,Maybe to live on,"Well,I had 2 suicide attempts and I was ready to kill myself again,but i decide to live,not because in the future i will change and these problems will disapear,but because there are still things that can make me happy."
1828,Leaving this world tonight. Thank you,"Found this site while searching for painless ways to kill ones self.. Great site and thanks for the info. My life is a mess, and the hopelessness and depression I've faced for years has won. I'm taking sleeping pills and running my car in the garage with the door closed when everyone in my home falls asleep tonight so it will be painless. My suicide note is already written, just havent decided where to put it/how I can make sure someone finds it. Again, thanks for all the info guys and good luck in life or whatever you do."
1830,hello,"I tried to kill myself before three days I think,i am not sure because I am still confused.I took 100 tablets of benesedine andalcohol,I conrcted my exaust of car through wibndow>but I didnyt succeded.I will like to talkk with sturdusk ib another period of ti,now"
1831,Tried to do it and it didn't work,hionestly how many pills and booze do you need to take.
1832,Somehow things just keep on gettin worse,Ive been more suicidal because before it was like my mind couldnt stop thinking about it. It was almost like everyday my mind would just think of different ways to kill myself. I really havent been able to talk or open up about alot of stuff eventho ive wrote and said so much in my past posts. Its just with my fear of abandonment and my fear of rejection its like i get really anxious about opening up. I guess on top of that the only person i was ever close with and trusted was probably the person that ended up hurting me more than anyone could ever do. I really dont know how i could have fallen in love with someone like that but it just seems like it was just meant to be. I was born in an abusive household and it just had an effect on me. I just feel like the closer or the longer things go on the worse it gets. Its like i have so many thing in my mind that are blocked out because i cant cope with them. Ive been trying to deal with memory loss because when my first relationship was over all my memory from that time in my life was blocked out. I guess on top of that when i met my ex it was like i couldnt remember anything before that so for awhile my memory was completely gone besides my ex breaking up with me. So i guess for about a week thats all i could think about but somehow i had to basically rip myself from being consumed by that. Ive read that somehow people can die from heartbreak and i feel like i dont know how i couldnt be any closer to something like that happening.
1833,Should I leave a suicide note?,"I know I'm going to do it, I just can't decide if it's better to leave a suicid note or not. Please tell me your thoughts on that (I'm not interested in your opinion on me killing myself)."
1834,Not really sure what to title this,Im gonna get stuff off of my chest so if your one of those people that will read what i am gonna write and then say well that was too long i would appreciate if you would just not read or at least keep those comments to yourself. I feel like im gonna talk about my time with being suicidal. its pretty weird because alot of people dont even get why you would be suicidal so i dont really know how you would support someone or help them in anyway if you see it like its not supposed to be the way you see it. Ive heard alot of people say this is a forum so i do understand that and its not the same as getting professional help but at least for me sometimes it does bother me that some people might say certain things and almost add to the problem. I will say that eventho i said it bothers me that doesnt mean that it has to be the same way for everyone. It doesnt bother me that ppl will argue and i dont feel like most people will get what im saying.
1835,Thank You,"I'd like to thank everyone who expressed care and concern for me these past few weeks. Both here and in the self harm forum. This time tomorrow I won't be here. It serendipitous that, everyone I pushed out of my life showed up randomly this weekend. It gave me a chance to see them, tell them things, and say good bye, in my own way. It felt like fate wanted me to see them one last time. I don't feel as afraid as I did last time. I feel good. I am worried about pain a little but it makes me laugh to think that this will be that last time I'll ever hurt. Again, I'd like to thank everyone who wrote encouraging things to me and offered advice. I genuinely did give thought to everything you all said, I just chose to go another route. I hope everyone who comes here looking for help here, in the future, finds comfort in the words given by the caring people on these boards. I hope everyone who may read this knows that just because I gave up it doesn't mean you have to or should. Keep talking to people. Keep looking for answers. Find that one steady hope to hold onto and build from. Good luck everyone and good bye."
1836,Meh...,"I haven't thought about suicide in over a year... but my ex is dying and I don't know how I'm going to even begin to handle it. We were together 4 years and broke up 3 months ago, and have been NC."
1837,I am freaken crazy...,"I am so depressed, so many lies about things getting better, I am bored as *** really. The area I live in sucks, I want to do more, but well I am can't drive. I just moved here to get high speed, the hick town I use to live in still has only dial-up. I start to cry at times & well not sure why. I am not happy really, if I die tonight, I don't care. I care about my parents, but not myself.:splat:"
1838,I'm thinking about doing it,I'm thinking about suffocating myself!
1839,Nothing left to live for,"So, I really think this is it."
1840,I was unjustly banned and this website on the true nature of suicide should be stickied...,
1842,am being Productive,I saw my care co-ordinator today.
1843,This is MY story...,I thought I would introduce myself at the start just so people can get an idea of who I am. You can all call me Anton. This is my first time doing anything like this. I am a 21 year old finance student who
1844,Thoughts not going away,"Hi all,"
1846,"lost myself, found myself and loosing me again, i dont want to deal with it anymore","recently i've been noticing that i've been loosing myself. i used to be one way and was very happy with it and lately i've been starting to loose the stuff about me that makes me, me. tonight i was reminded of who i am and what makes me, me. i got really peeved at my mother and it brought me right back to who i used to be. which is who i want to be. the only problem is i dont know if i can hold onto myself the way i want to be. when i realized that i wouldnt be able to hold onto myself i did the one thing that i did before that was the first to go (cutting myself) now i realized that i have lost myself so much that i cant even cut myself right anymore."
1847,I am hated for loving,"I am hated for loving, haunted for wanting..."
1848,What is the point in going on?,I'm never going to find love and without love how is life worth living? I've been alone all my life and I don't wanna deal with it anymore. I'm an embarrassment to society so I actually think I would be doing the world some good if I disappeared.
1849,"I get closer and closer, it feels like",Sexually confused
1850,How much do you want it?,"Do you feel like killing yourself when your upset, or every moment of every day?"
1851,why life?,"For many years I've often wondered what makes people so happy. I have always thought about death as a way out, and for the most part, there are very few days when it hasn't been a passing thought."
1852,Being yourself,"Hello,"
1853,At A Dead End,Well for two years I've just been so depressed. People ask me what's wrong and I honestly don't know. People try to help me but they can't because they try to find out what's making me feel this way but I always come off as being stubborn and not wanting to cooperate and they give up on me. I don't want to be this way I don't try to be this way but nobody understands me. All I've been able to think about is suicide and I've attempted it a couple times too. I don't want to keep living like this but no one seems to be able to help me. I don't know what to do I'm at a dead end all I want to do is die and that feeling keeps getting stronger. I used to be able to tell myself that everything will get better and make myself believe it. But I've been doing that for two years and I'm starting to get smerter than myself and it's been getting harder and harder to convince myself that it'll get better. I just don't know what to do!
1854,sick of being tired and tired of being me,I wish I had fight left in me
1856,I need some help. I need someone to talk to,My emotional state is becoming worse and worse everyday. I feel as though I'm hanging by a dangerously thin thread and it's only a matter of time before something unfortunate happens to me.
1858,I really need help,"What do you do when you have really bad SA (Social Anxiety) and can't click with anyone. Then you finally meet someone and you really love, someone who understands you, but your condition crushes the relationship and makes you push her away to the point where she leaves. Therapy is not working, medication is not working, I feel so hopeless. I've been thinking about ending it for weeks, I even purchased a gun to do so. I cant live this way, if nothing helps then whats the point, I have no job because of this, no future, NOTHING. I've amounted to nothing, I could care less about anything right now. I wake up every day and wish I would have just died in my sleep. I hate my life and everything in it, I'm slowly getting consumed by all my negative thoughts. I've posted here before but I'm starting to get more courage to do this and it scares me, but what needs to be done needs to be done right. I just wish it didn't have to come to this, If I was born a normal person I'd be fine but I got screwed."
1860,Rock Bottom,"I'm at the lowest I've ever been and I've been pretty low at times but never as bad as now. I look at my friends and people around me and I just can't understand how they can be so happy. I can't even remember what it feels like to be happy and full of energy. I actually came extremely close commiting suicide after school today. I'm just overwhelmed with depression right now I can't stop crying. I can't tell my parents because they'll overreacted and go crazy and thats the last thing I need. I've decided that I'll just keep trying to kill myself until I finally gety it right. It's whats best for me, besides no one will miss me no one really pays attention to me now."
1861,I hate myself and I want to die,"Hi. Im 17 years old. I recently got my first girlfriend and its not everything I thought it would be. I like her, but things are still so bad. Im getting bad grades and my parents said they wont help me pay for college unless I get good grades..and Im going to be done with high school by june. My parents recently read all of my online conversations and they read about me talking about some drugs I did and read about me calling my dad an a-hole and all this other stuff. My parents earlier this year caught me smoking cigarettes and they think I just started, even though I've done it for 3 years. If I wasnt addicted, I would've stopped, but I cant. I've tried. I got fired from my job that I enjoyed and am now at a terrible job with long hours and low pay. I drink alcohol about every weekend and get drunk every weekend. I almost got in trouble with the cops for it twice in a month. I've gone into this terrible way of living and looking at things, that it's become a habit I can not stop. Has anyone felt like this? Anyway, I dont wanna hear the same old speech about how it is wrong to kill yourself. I was just wondering if anyone knows any painless ways to kill yourself or least painful ways compared to other. I know it sounds cowardish, but frankly I dont care"
1862,what I'm feeling right now,I take the knife and slit my wrist
1863,A few questions before I do it,"I'm definitely at a point where I'm not going to change my mind so please don't try to make me not do it. Anyways, I'm 22 so I'm a little unschooled as far as how this works. I really want to leave a note because I want to tie up loose ends.. and I want people to know how I felt.. how unhappy I have been (though it's obvious) and for some fo them, what I think of them (and where I hope they go). I also wanted to find out how this will effect my family financially.. I'm assuming they won't be liable for my debts.. also, can I will things in my note or do I need to make a separate document?"
1864,Poetry written throughout my depression,"Poems I wrote throughout a 3 year span (most were lost, this is all I have left)"
1865,I am going to do it,"I wrote in my diary that I would do it (Sui****) in a years time, which would be March 2008...but i dont think i can wait that long. I lost the love of my life the only thing that made me remotely happy...and I know that is unfair becuase we are responsible for finding our own happiness but i am past trying anymore i have seen councillors been on perscriptions but nothing helps. He lied to me, cheated on me and lied some more and I cna not take it anymore. The other girl is so much prettier, intelligent and funnier than me...I have always had self hate and been inadequate at everything since i can remember. the only thing to have prevented me before was the guilt i felt at causing so much pain to my family and to the guy who will think i killed myself becuase of him..i dont want them or him to suffer...but i cant do this i cant get up everyday and carry on with my pointless, talantless life...if your not happy you should move out the way right? and give room to those that are..i hope they would understand..a small part of me believes i may go to hell...but im not religious i guess its something you have to think of...but if there is a God he must be able to see how much i am hurting..I am not taking the decision lightly I have felt liek this since i was 16...its time..i wrote notes for my family and realised i wouldnt change them when i re-read them today..i am happy with them and thats how i know i am ready..why am i writing this to you all...i have to do something to waste the time until next weekend...the day...sorry if this offends anyone, it is nto my intention..."
1867,Someone To Talk To,I've been thinking and even though I've tried to talk to many people and they haven't helped I should keep trying to find somebody who really understands me or at least tries to. I don't want to live anymore but at the same time I don't want to kill myself only because I know what it'll do to my friends. I care about them way too much to put them through something like that. So I guess I'll keep trying to find some one to talk to. I always have this feeling that I'm wasting everyones time. I don't want to waste your guys time but if anyone could take some time and bother themselves with my probblems you never know you might be the one that helps turn my life around. I hate asking people to stop and help me but nothhing else has worked and I think it's time to put my pride on the self and just ask. So here it is SOMEBODY HELP ME PLEASE
1868,Someone Plz Help Me,[B]
1869,"When You Feel Like You Can't Go On, Please Hold On.","When You Feel Like You Can't Go On, Please Hold On."
1870,I'm One Day Over,"I planned on killing myself yesterday. I had already planned it out. I'd written my letters, which now sit on my night stand. I'd bought the instrument I was going to use. I'd said my goodbyes as best I could without alerting anyone to what I was going to do. I had everything settled, except the fear. I was still too afraid to do it. So, now I feel like I'm on borrowed time. The way I see it, things will naturally work themselves out, one way or the other. Part of me want's to be pulled away from the edge, while the other wants to be pushed over. I guess that's why I'm here. The part that wants to be pulled away is grasping at whatever is within reach. I can't go to my therapist with this because I've only just begun seeing her and she'd definitely have me hospitalized if she knew this. I tried calling a hotline and had a really bad experience and almost wound up getting hospitalized so this is my Alamo."
1871,This has been bugging me.,"Do you all truly believe no one should choose to die, no matter who they are or what they have done?"
1872,Friend's husband shot himself...,I'm in shock right now. It just came suddenly...my boyfriend and I have a mutual friend which my BF lives next to. Her husband shot himself in the bathroom today. He was found after my BF kicked in the door. I know the couple was fighting but this just seems so surreal.
1874,I need help.,"I'm 18 years old. Just graduated high school. Starting college in about a week. But, I feel like I have nothing. Everyone says I have my whole life ahead of me. But, I feel like I have a life filled with... well... nothing... ahead of me, and that's not a life worth living. I don't want to die. Most of the time. Sometimes, I just sit alone and think about the ways I could do it, and it seems like I would be so much better off. I've tried. I've cut multiple times, but my ex boyfriend always calls me and comes over to stop me and help me. I've tried taking pills. But they made me sick, and I tried to keep them down but I threw up anyway."
1875,Sick of it All,"I am just so tired of life, tired of being used, ridiculed, and a stepping stone for people who have no regard for anyone but themselves. I'm sick of school- busted my butt in college only to end up working a part time job making 8.25 an hour. I'm tired of people not really listening to me...only looking at me like I'm half crazy when I try to talk to someone about how I feel. I keep holding on, and waiting for things to change, but things only get worse. I'm so alone...I only have my immediate family but my death would devastate my 2 youngest brothers. But I just can't do this anymore. It sucks that the only reason I have to live is because I would hate for my brothers to feel the way I feel. To hate yourself and your entire existence with every breathe you take, it's overwhelming. People tell me cliche's that life will get better etc etc but it's only getting worse. I've been ready to go. I know that my death would bring a smile to a few people's faces."
1876,Serious Love problem,I have this problem that is suppose to be gone forever...
1877,"very sad, thinkin about it:|","ive been extremely depressed before. two years ago, i had some problems and i did not get out of the house for 8 month, i was constantly hurting myself and i could not snap out of it, no one was there for me, i did not want to meet anyone, depression makes u do that, i woke out of depression because of my bf but right now i feel he is better without me, i feel he doesnt love me anymore and he knows im in a depression and cant do anything about it. i know i had my faults...so tell me what happeneds when u become the main source of pain for the one you love? i am so damn sure he wants to end the relationship but he is afraid im going to get to depressed because of that. anyway i dont have any friends, i cant talk to anyone i dont wanna be here on earth, i rly have no reason to live, i am useless here...u know what he told me when i told him that? he said: you are too sensitive for this world. ...maybe that's why i should not be here, if i could only find a way to do it quickly and painlessly id do it this second and no one would rly know i did it. no one would care, everyone would just go back to their lovely lives and forget about me, anyway all ive done was make everyone hurt and miserable, anyway i still love my bf and i rly hope if i die him to be happier. anyway being another year in a depression, i cant stand that thats for sure, and there are no chances for me getting better. i wont ask here how can i kill myself painlessly because i wont get an answer to that., only replies like you should not give up etc etc...thanks for listenin"
1878,What to do when ...,"Oh GOD, someone I know just posted on a forum (not this one) a message that she's gonna kill herself."
1879,Im just tired of writing about this,"I havent had anything bad happen to me that was like crazy but i dont feel like ive ever felt this bad. Ive been in more pain, more depressed, more anxiety, but probably not more tears. I basically cryed my eyes out today. it was like some type of release of just a build up of so many things. Its like i dont want to die and i have things that keep me on that side but then its just like for the most part i dont care. I just see myself slipping more and more into that part. Its just i honestly dont care how bad it gets i dont feel like i would ever kill myself. Its just i always think about how i wish i could just die and just get over with this. Its been a long life and i like who i am but i cant describe in words how much i hate my life. I wish i could scream at the top of my lungs until my head popped off with just how much i hate and am sick and tired of my life. I basically just have stopped caring. Ive always gotten to this point where things get so bad that i cant do anything but be indifferent. I once used to joke around about how when it was a crazy time in the world with the wars , weather, and everything just seemed to be going down hill, that i wish i could just sit down and i would just watch the world end and laugh because of how stupid some people are. It blows my mind all the time. Its like girls at my job working and my boss is flirting with them and hes a married man but they like it because they get off on his power and probably how hes an older man. It always made me sick and i really thought that people in this world would be more like that but for the most part i feel like no one really cares. I could just write and write about how much i hate this world but even if i tried i dont really know what i would like or even love. I would have said love is a beautiful thing but because of what ive gone thru its like i despise it with my whole broken heart. Ive basically dont even feel that part of my body anymore."
1881,My little sister died.HELP,My 14 year old sister killed her self last night!!! * * * ..why would such a beautiful girl do that...I never saw it coming..!! I'm Kristin and ive been trying to her my sister and brother out of my mothers house hold..I feel THAT I HAVE STROnGLY FAILED!!!!
1882,my effing fault,"my effing fault if HE does it again. if it hurts someone else, rapes someone else, and all because of what? me being a stupid idiot and in capable of taking him to court. not that they would believe me anyway, cause i was into kinky stuff back then. into being cuffed up/tied up and being controlled, even tho he raped me and beat me up. and he confessed and there are witnesses that heard him talk about it. the police wouldn't listen to me. all i am is some stupid just turned adult, who is suicidal and suffer from hearing voices."
1883,depression,"I am so tired of feeling this way. I don't have a bad life, i have many things in my life that i am very fortunate to have. I know there are so many people out there that have so much less than i have and that are in far worst situation and more desperate then i am in."
1884,The Eternal Curse; anyone here ever comtemplated suicide because,of insomnia?
1885,Last night I just wanted to go,"I feel so sorry for my boyfriend, he has come through for me everytime this has happened. The last time he found me in the kitchen with big gashes in my arm and blood all over me. He can't stand the sight of blood (he's squeamish) but cleaned me up and took me to the hospital the next day. Last night I cut again (not as badly, the last incident happened in March/April) and I was breaking down in tears. I felt so guilty about wanting to leave but I am finding things just so hard at the moment. And I feel bad because my life isn't awful, it isn't hard on me the way it is hard for others."
1886,Postponing suicide daily,"So basically, I hate myself and want to die. I'm 28 and I've had only a handful of happy days in those 28 years. I've had a lot of pain, misery, and suffering. I look around and all I see is pain, misery and suffering. What I wonder is not why"
1887,So you tired of living?,And so she wakes up
1891,Sacred heart diet,"Ok so i got Social Phobia like probably a year or 2 ago, im 17 now. I dropped out of high school then to and then I gained weight. I basically had no future so i thought about killing myself dozens of times. But i think i changed my mind, ive been losing weight(kinda hard)so i figured i should try again. But then i just looked online for some online diplomas and there expensive as {EDIT}. My mom already can barely afford to get me alone healthy food so i always just try not to eat(its always kinda fattening\cheap stuff she gets). I really cant go back to an actual school and cant get a job without a diploma, so should i just go back to plan A?"
1892,Not suicidal but I don't wanna live,"Iv'e had so many people pass away from suicide to natural causes, and Now since I have barely no one to talk to, I don't wanna live, I'm not saying I will kil myself,but everyday i feel worse. I don't know what to do."
1893,Not Sure Anymore,"I say that so often lately, out loud and to myself. I am very scared right now as thoughts of ending my life have been dominating me for a very long time. since I was about 13, I had problems with anxiety and depression. I tried once to end my life."
1894,Rock bottom,"Ok, so here i am....."
1895,Sucide,So first off let me start off with some information about myself.
1896,"Carry on, carry on","I've decided I've gotta do it. Every day gets worse and more pointless than the last. Work work work. My life has been nothing but trite redundancy and wasted energy. So what if I know some slightly complicated words? That doesn't make ANYTHING better. I try %110 at anything I do, and that's nothing more than wasted energy 'cause the results always end up the same as if I didn't try."
1897,I just can't do it any more,I can't believe I'm posting on an Internet message board like this. I don't think I even want or expect help any more. I just want to say what I don't have the balls to say out loud to someone I know. I just want to disappear. I don't fit in this world and every day is a struggle to just make it to the end of the day so that I can go to sleep. Waking up is like a nightmare all over again.
1899,done.,I'm done for. I can't keep living like this.
1900,My dad tried to kill himself about 18 hours ago.....,"Im really hurt, my dad who was 50 od with sleeping pills, he wanted to die. And her receptionist said, that the day before he was writing a letter while he was crying. My dad suffered a really bad motorcycle accident about 1 year ago and he hurt his arm, (all the nerves were pulled) so he cant move it. And he got kind of fat. He was living with my uncles because of the accident and because my parents are divorced. And owned a furniture shop. The store was very good for about 2 to 3 years, but after the accident it all went downhill, so he had decided two close the store (2 days before the od). I have a little brother 12 years old, and me, and i just ask myself, ¿why didn't he ask for help, didn't he care about my brother and i?, he was so selfish, and didn't care about the scars he was going to leave me just so he could end his pain, and leave my mother with school debts and house debts, he was going rto hand the problem to us!!! I'm 16 years old and in high school, so i wonder, ¿what would have happened if he had succeeded? Im just really hurt and wanted to tell someone, because i have a lot of cousins and aunts, but i dont have any trust with them, because my dad and mom where always the ones with problems and i was the poor child with the disfunctionjal family, so i dont like the pitty my family will give me, it just makes me feel powerless."
1901,Suicide threats,"What do you do when someone continually makes suicide threats? yet, they have never harmed themselves."
1902,I sometimes think of suicide...,"And I dont like it, I was a very happy person no worries in the world when I was 18 - 22 but at the age off 22 my whole life changed when I lost my grandad and mum to cancer at aged 56, shortly after I was arrested for something stupid and it lost me my job I worked so hard for, I lost my brand new flat that was part of the job my world just came crashing down on me, then in April this year my first and only love (gf) dumped me and after I quit my part time job due to depression. I am now umemployed and live luckily with my father otherwise would be homeless."
1904,A Dream I had,"I don’t know if this is the right thread, but my older brother died 18 years ago when I was a kid. Last night, after many years of not even thinking about it, I had a dream where my brother was asking me about my life since he died and he wanted me to catch him up on everything. He was genuinely interested in even the most mundane details. He explained that he was away because he ""had to be"" and I understood though he didn't elaborate. It was soo good to talk to him. When I woke up, I realized it was only a dream and that made me very sad. I just thought it was strange since I hadn't thought of him in years. I miss him and would have liked to know what he would have become in life had he not given up when he was so young."
1905,Depressed,"I guess I used to be a happier person, but I've always been a sensitive person and lately it has turned into, I would assume, a bad depression. Sometimes I have trouble getting out of bed in the morning and all I do is cry."
1906,The closest ive ever been to suicide,"Ive been on this forum alot since i broke up with my first ex. I went to therapy for about a year and a couple of months. I basically just vented like crazy because i felt like i was going to go crazy or i already was and couldnt help myself just say what i was going thru because of how painful it was. I feel like today i really lost it. Ive been basically battling myself because of how she broke up with me and also lost her virginity to someone else but says it should of been me but she says she would have never have sex with me, thats the mind of an abused person. Its just now im that abused person because of how bad she neglected me and emotionally abused me. I can only describe the pain she left me in as being raped and now i constantly struggle with myself because in my mind i feel like i would want to rape her to show her what it felt like for her to do what she did to me. I never talk about any of the stuff im going to talk about because i have abandonment issues and dont trust people and on top of what my ex did to me i dont see how im going to be able to trust ppl again."
1907,Do you ever feel trapped in your own mind,If you look at my previous posts on ENA you may think I am just having a bad day but in reality the last 5 months of my life have been absolute torture. I can honestly say that nothing terrible has happened to me. I guess what triggered this was the fact my gf broke up with me about 5 months ago.
1908,"I'm done for, this is it.","I'm tired of living like this, I've been depressed for so long, I have really bad social anxiety and that makes it hard to make friends let alone find a lover. I do have a group of people I hang around with but I'm always the odd one out. I had a beautiful g/f that somehow wanted to be with me but I was stupid and kept pushing her away because my illness was making this relationship not work so I requested a break until I'm better but she doesn't see that. This has prevented me from living life to the fullest, this illness is ruining me. Every single day it feels as if my brain is ""off"" and there's no way to turn it back on."
1909,World Suicide Prevention Day,
1910,How to help a suicidal friend?,"We've been friends for a few months now, and the entire time I've been trying to help him get past his suicidal feelings. Everytime it seems like he's making progress, he'll say something like, ""I was planning to kill myself this morning,"" ""I put a bag over my head and it felt good,"" or ""I'm going to kill myself, just not yet."""
1911,my life is a mess.,For the past 2 years I have been unhappy and havnt gone a day without thinking sod it lets just do it and get it over with. I hate my life and I just want the pain to stop. I am only 17 years old at the moment and I feel like a complete an utter loser. I feel this way because of my dad well thats my excuse anyways. Hes a complete * * * * * * * and if I had the bottle I would kill him. Hes a control freak and I just want my pain to stop so he can feel guilty for all the crap hes put me through.
1912,"The girl, the gold heart & everything",In his 1971 novel
1913,I wont to kill myself,"I have 300 pils of valium and 60 pills of seroxat,and with alcohol will do it but not to much pills.I am asking how much do I have to take.Other advice I dont need.Thanks"
1914,The right to die,"Hello ena,"
1915,for the first time im thinking about suicide,"I'd like to start off by saying I dont believe I could actually do it, but everything in my life has essentially crumbled to nothing. I just feel really really down. in a nutshell, my girl left me for another guy, my mother is dying of cancer, got laid off, an old friend died in a car accident recently and my dog got run over by a truck. (insert country song joke here)"
1916,AAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!Can't make the pain go away,"A couple days ago, my mom broke her leg. In two days I start med school up again and my brother just moved out for the first time to go to school. I really need to be strong and stable right now, but I can feel myself slipping. I've been avoiding making lunch because of the temptation of the knives. I feel empty, but there is so much pain and pressure inside my head. I feel like my whole body aches, I couldn't sleep last night and feel like crap. I suffer with severe depression, have since my dad died."
1917,I don't know what to do...(a long story),"Yes, I am contemplating suicide. I am 22, and I know I am young, I know there are people worse off, and I have heard all that ""It will get better"" bs. I don't want to hear those words together in the same sentence ever again. I suffer from depression and PTSD, so it makes it almost impossible to go on, day to day. I stopped living, and am just existing."
1918,would it be better?,soo ive been thinkin about it for awhile. Offing myself. I dunno if ill ever do it but man something makes me think things would be better. like i have this warped idea that in death things would be better. Dont know why or where this idea was put into my head but it worries me that one day ill convince myself that the pro's out-weigh the cons. I think about just driving out somewhere desolate and downing pills or slicing my wrist. When im driving i'll have a freakishly real day dream of just tugging the wheel into traffic or off a cliff. It really scares me that i think if i die ill live in the perfect dream for ever. Even more scary is that it humbles me somewhat.
1919,*Gasp* Not another suicidal teen!,"Well, let's see... Where'd this whole ""I want to kill myself"" deal start..."
1920,Unbearable,"Hello,"
1921,sleep,"Like others, I do not know what to do right now."
1922,Yeah right,I've been here a little while and already I can tell that it really is eAMalone because honestly...you guys can't help me. No one can.
1923,so sick of feeling like this,"i hate feeling so great one day and then by the end of it, feel like a piece of worthless * * * * ."
1924,Cant handle anymore,"I dont want to make a post with all my difficulties, I will just try getting to the point. Yesterday I woke up with no will to live at all. I went through the whole day feeling completely dead inside, I coudn't concentrate on anything else I had to do. That is funny, just about the last 3 or 4 days ago I was feeling fine and now I feel like the garbage of the universe. This behavior is convincing me each time more that I am depressed, I never went to a doctor to confirm it, but Im pretty sure about that. And like you should be thinking by now, I am very tempted to take my life. I wont try to write here about all the things that I believe are making me feel like this, but I think I can summarize them into one thing: lack of courage. When I think about my life I realize that in about 95% of the situations I went through in it I acted in a cowardly way. What bugs me is that I am really devastaded when I see so many things I could have done/said differently, but these are chances that I wont have again.....and the worst thing is that I dont see things getting better in the future.....I am 21 years old and I have noticed that courage is my problem just recently, I feel now that I havent enjoyed the period that I was a teenager at all......with such fears like being rejected, having no friends, being alone making me stand still and do nothing........and these things that scared me so much in the end came to happen people, can someone give me a word of cheer or hope? I really need it...."
1925,Farewell,"A while back I made a topic here on ENA and I appreciated the advice people gave me. Like they suggested, I went to a specialist to talk about my emotional instability."
1926,Torment House,I guess it started when my uncle and brother died in an accident.
1927,I don't want too.,Tonight has been totally awful.
1928,Is suicide selfish?,"The title kinda says it all, just wanted opinions."
1929,Yo,"So, I typed in ""I want to kill myself"" on google just to see what happens and this is the site that came up. Googles, great."
1930,feel really bad,i am ment to feel happy today as it is my birthday but i dont i hurt myself last night but it dont feel enought i dont know what to do
1931,falling fast,"i hate my life nothing goes right my dad killed himself not too long ago.. my relationships going to hell! i was dignosed with manic depression,bipolar,and split personality."
1932,I want direction.,Hello.
1933,i cant,"i try and try and try to move on. try to better myself. always tell myself that things will be okay but all i feel is this anger inside of me growing and growing. anger at people, the world, myself. extreme anger. i can't hold it in anymore."
1934,someone like that can't survive,"broke up w/ Brian - i will never have a long term relationship w/ anyone....i am not worth having anyway....all i do is hurt people...i have seen so much that i don't know how to handle the things that happen in my daily life...the arguments with my grandmother and the emotions that i am not allowed to express so they build and build til i cant handle them and they come out in dangerous ways...im hanging by a thread...everyday i am hanging onto life my short threads and i don't know how much longer i can stay and be able to cope with the way i feel....the anger and hatred i have for myself is eating away at me.....there is nothing inside but each day i feel less and less needed, and more worthless to the world around me...i guess i had a lot of choices of what to do back when all this started but now i have made all the wrong ones without the guidance of my mom or dad...ive spiraled down into a deep black bottomless whole where there isnt any light, just darkness, pain, suffering, torment, betrayal, anger, self hatred, violence and death.....those things make up who i am....and someone like that cant survive...."
1935,6 weeks to go.....,"If you could get inside my head for just one second then you’d understand why i am doing this,"
1936,im about as lost as he was,Basically my dad committed suicide october8th 2007. It didn't really come as a shock. But then kind of did because hes attempted it once when i was really little. Back then he shot himself in the stomach but that didn't succeeded!
1937,Nowhere else to turn,Hey everyone.
1938,lost in the dark!,My life at the moment feels so dark and bleak..I was married for 11 years had 6 yo twins that were concieved through ivf after 5 years of trying.
1939,I am tired.........,"I am tired and just want my life to take its course.... I dont want to kill myself but would like for my life to end. I wish it was time for my day to come. I know suicide it not the answer but I am tired of everything around me. my wife is cheating on me and my family doesnt talk to me and co-workers hate me. I really dont know why? I would give and have gave people the shirt of my back. I am not looking for anyone to feel sorry for me, I just needed to write how I feel.... I lost my father 4years ago and I have let him down by not finishing college and let myself down by never moving on... I have no friends and my wife is never happy no matter what I do...I wish my time to meet the good lord is now....until then..... god bless.."
1940,defeated and alone,"OK , so at this very moment i feel like a complete and utter failure and that i am so tired of trying to fight for things to be where they needs to be."
1941,mom of 6,"I am stuck. I have to endure my pain and depression. I have 6 children to be here for. I so want out. I really have nothing worth my being here except my children....I will NOT leave them here for their abusive father to have. Its bad enough they have to spend time with him. He still does his best to tear me down verbally and I have no recourse. I am broke...I have so much work to do...and I am so lonely. I look 6 years older than I am (44) and no man will ever want me. I can't drink as it makes me violently sick...and I won't do drugs (never have)....and I need something to keep me going every day. I know it should be my children...but this depression is growing deeper and the desire to get rid of me is getting too strong. It is affecting my work...my attitude...I am fighting it...but not very well. I am SO tired...so drained...so empty. I wasn't meant to do all of this alone. The soon-to-be ex has leukemia and my lawyer told me not to divorce him...but wait for him to die!!! Nice, huh? You'd think having a deadly disease like leukemia would wake a person up and help them see they are wasting their life...and just hurting those around them...but no...it has made him more cruel!"
1942,i want to die,i really want to die i can not take the pain any more pepole dont understand how much pain i am feeling i just have to end it i will be the best thing for everyone if i just die
1943,Euthanasia of a lost soul,Ok...
1944,Last night I was afraid - and found my way here.,Last night I was afraid.
1945,Please help...,Life Sucks.
1946,why?,"why me? why do bad things happen to me? Why did mom die? Why did dad die? Why is Scott wanting to commit suicide? Why am I? What makes me want to be dead? or better yet why do I have the dark morbid thoughts of suicide and hurting myself? Y do i continually think of this: Will i be denied? tourniquet. My suicide? why do i think these things?Why do i have so much anger, self hatred and no confidence in myself? I hate myself more than i hate then i could ever hate the world. Why wont ppl just let me die or better yet help me die?"
1947,the end,i feel that i really cant go on any more i have tried everything to help me but nothing dose i know if i end it there is no coming back but maybe that is the best i will be gone for good im so sorry but i think it is time for me to end it
1948,I just don't have the desire to go on....,"My life has never been a happy story.. No one's really liked me, people have always used me. Even my parents have betrayed me.. I'm unattractive,I'm funny looking and weird. I'm gay & no one likes gay people... My life is far from exciting. I have no one and I spend years feeling isolated and alone. No matter how hard I try to make things right in my life, something always happen to mess up. I can't go on anymore. I was actually thinking about stabbing myself with a kitchen knife last night but I couldn't do it because I got too scared. I don't think I can ever kill myself but I surely wouldn't care if I died.. there's really nothing to live for... No one understands me.. NO ONE. I'm so tired of this selfish world,everyone is out for no one but themselves. No love,no happiness.. Just bitter rude people who use and abuse you. My own father betrayed me! He was never a good father! He sickens me to my stomach... Always criticizes me about what's wrong with me, never a care from him at all.. My mother isn't any better.. I don't see how she's stayed with him for soo long after all that he's done to her & this family. My mother is weak to me.. She let the man do what he wanted, cheat on her & now she's complaining because my father got arrested and fired for stealing on the job and she's barely making any money at the job she works now to support everyone.. I feel sorry for her I really do.. Now she bailed my father out.. his stupid behind isn't even looking for a job.. all he does is sit in the house all day... At least I'm trying to find a job with no luck! The man has the audacity to tell me what I need to do with my life and he can't even look at the mess he's caused.."
1949,Whats the purpose,"So I sit at home and stay home everyday I'm a hermit. I'm too scared to leave the house, I'm scared of bumping into people I know because I don't know what to say. I feel left out all the time wanting to be a part of a group of friends but no one wants a weird pimply faced girl with nappy hair and no sense of style. I've had suicidal thoughts and I can't stop...I don' think I'd ever have the ability to do anything but I want my depression and suicidal thoughts to go away. I've never had a best friend and the only person who has come close told me straight up that I would never be her best friend. I'm about to lose my boyfriend he says i need to ""take some responsibility for my * * * * ing self"" but I don't know what that means I'm a very responsible person I pay my bills, I've got a job I just have no friends. I'm tired I was supposed to die when I was born and I wish so hard that I would have but because I can't change the past I try to slowly kill myself with cigarrettes. I don't know how to make friends. How do you make friends? how do you meet random people is it stupid to go up to someone and ask them to be your friend? I am so lame. I just wanted to see if anyone else had the same issues that they feel they're life is going no where and that there is no point cause that's how i feel i just want to sit around and smoke out. I want to laugh like i used to and I can't find it anymore.....it's like my whole being has changed into someone i don't recognized. Does anyone know of a psychiatrist or therapist chat room? ](*,)"
1950,I don't know if I can do this anymore,"The one thing I loved more than life itself is gone. I've been dealing with severe depression for years now and these last five years have been torture and my little dog was the ONLY thing who could cheer me up. I live in a place where I don't belong and have one friend here. I haven't had a real job in five years and now I am supposed to start one on Monday, but I am in such pain over losing my beloved little dog that I just don't know if I can."
1951,Tired of being human.,"What's the point of it all? I sit here examining my life; past, present, future and I find it all rather useless. Looking at it from a metaphysical sense, there is no real point. I have no issues with that, what I do has as much destiny or purpose as anything else; mainly none. So, removing the metaphysical ""what's the purpose of life"", what standard should I set myself against? Lacking the metaphysical, lets use the natural world. At its basest level, life has two primary functions; survive and procreate. Everything else is built around these two functions, the only thing that changes are the buzzwords and spin we put on them. These are the standards I will be using to examine my life."
1952,fiance's ex is going crazy- worried,I'm worry about my fiances's ex.
1954,Help me out.. I'm about to Suicide.,"Hello, im about to suicide, I give you 5 reasons, and after that I can give you some more, let's just start with this one."
1955,Confessions of a college dropout,"I am trying to remain stronger..I have tried to not disappoint my parents but nothing is working out for me... I have done everything they have wanted me to do. Attending college was what they wanted from me so I attended...The reason I attended was because I was tired of the abuse from my father...The hitting stopped but I hate the way he talks to me and makes me feel like I don't matter. Needless to say I messed up my first year of college and they knew I messed up...I wasn't going to college to learn I was using it as an escapism...it was my freedom..all i did was party, I finally had a social life.I was so happy with complete strangers, being with my own family felt like a chore. I started to look for love from men I met on campus, I let them have their way with me anything to feel love. I didn't know what love from a man was like I didn't know what to expect. I fell for the games, I didn't know any better. I let them use me thinking that I was using them. My grades eventually started to have their ups and downs, mostly downs. My parents would ask to see my grades and I had figured out how to work the system. I figured out how to change my grades, basically feeding them b.s. They never questioned it, never asked to read a paper, nothing. So the b.s. continued and I was dismissed from the university, I began to attend a community college still traveling up north in the area of the university. The community college would send bills to my parents house and they never asked me about, they never questioned me. This bothered me more than anything..I wanted them to confront me, yell at me..but I got nothing. They kept telling everyone I was still at the university, still on the dean's list. They lived a lie and still do and so did I. Recently I have given up, I don't care about school, I don't have that desire to learn. I want to leave it all behind...travel Europe or kill myself are the options I have given myself. I put kill myself with everything. The thing that keeps me from doing is the hurt I would cause my sister and friends. I don't want them to go through that. I don't know why I'm here..I wonder why I'm here everytime someone dies...I wonder why not me...."
1956,"Unemployment, no girlfriend, dwindling money...","Some of you might already know my story, so I'll save the context. I did some prowling around on my unemployment ""portal"", and I discovered that nothing has been sent yet in the form of checks and whatnot."
1957,"Live is not fair, death is.","I seriously need a professional help, cause im just terrified when I want to talk with people, scared to death of being judged by others even on the internet forums like this one. Don't think I deserve to live and feel like I ruined the forums when I leave my comments on them so im rearly coming back to see the replies, even feel ashamed when someone has noticed me or when my videos on youtube have viewers cause I think why should someone waste there time on me."
1959,Situation,I have longed for relationships all my life and it has come to the point where I can not take it any more. It causes me too much pain. It is vital that I am able to have a Relationship within the next few months. I often imagine and fantasise too myself about how I want the future to be in terms of relationships.
1961,Life is a game,"There are winners and losers. Some are good players and some are bad players. I happen to be a loser and a bad player. I've tried to ignore these feelings and keep on going but it's becoming difficult. Thankfully, the choice of suicide will become easier in the near future. Once my mother and dog dies, I really have nothing to feel guilty about by ending it all. No other close family that will care much. No girlfriend/wife. No friends. I'm alone as it is. I'm not about to go on completely alone. So I'll just suck it up for the next 5, 7, 10, 15 years and just pull the trigger."
1962,I Almost Did (All should read),this might be a shock to my normal readers.
1963,I feel like i keep gettin worse,I just feel alot worse then before. I was barely hanging on for whatever type of life i could before. Ive had trouble dealing with stuff that i really just feel like i cant deal with because its too painful. Its been so much much happening to me since all of this happened. I dont even know if people can help me because my whole life ive always seen that the stuff i go thru no one really knows what to do or say because its just beyond crazy. I think im gettin worse because before i would just have suicidal thoughts but i would try to just let them happen when they would or find some way to stop myself from ever let them be more than just thoughts. Its just now it seems like its more serious like im thinking about how i would do it and i know when u start to plan it thats just about as bad as it gets before it can get any worse. I just feel like my whole life must be some type of sick joke. I grew up without any type of relationship with my parents but i always tried to stay positive saying at least it wasnt a bad one. Its just growing up like that i have so much of what i want in life is to have a happy family or at at least a family that functions. Its just my whole life ive tried to find anyway to get away from my family or do whatever i could to not end up like them. So now i see thats not going to happen because im going thru all the things ive tried my whole life to stop from happening. So i try to take the good from that which im alittle bit more understand of what made them like that but its so depressing to realize that whatever i tried to do couldnt help me to stop from going thru this.
1965,My last post about myself. (50 mins. of writing),"Hello guys/gals. I just want to start off by saying I am not suicidal, nor have i been for a long time. What the intent of this post is however, is hopefully, the suicide of the portion of my life that makes me unhappy."
1966,Confession before i die,"Hey everyone, just wanted to confess my sins before i take my life on Friday night. I have been thinking about it for a while now and i see it as the only option."
1967,is there a point,i dont see a point to life.
1968,Im actually doing worse than yesterday,I dont know where to begin but i wrote some stuff yesterday. I tried to get out as much as i could but my mind wasnt working write so it came out all crazy. Ive been dealing with really bad anxiety for over 2 years. Ive been really depressed since my first break-up. It basically ruined me in the sense that i basically couldnt remember anything after it happened. Ive been really scared to even talk about stuff but after what happened to my cousin not that long ago i basically just dont really care about anything anymore. Im really just sick of having to live a life like this. I'm trying to snap myself out of all of this but i keep on just getting stuck on the same stuff. I really dont remember my life ever being good and the best it was had to do with me thinking things would get better and it never did. My life is hundred times worse then i thought my life could ever be.
1969,my friend is now gone....,well she was my friend but it was my fiances ex from like 4 years ago. she turned lesbian and they stayed friends. I have no prob with that she's a sweet person I just didn't like her trying to touch me.
1970,Do I want to die..right now?,"Life was good then became crap. All I wanted to do was die. The it kinda turned around and I had a smile on my face, and for once in a long time I was happy, I was my old cherry self that I had not really seen nor felt in a long time, now I am back to my sad pissed off was mood. So as I write this I sit here crying (yes, I admit it) thinking do I want to die right now, or just disappear and leave everything that I have behind and try to start a new life ALONE somewhwere. I really have nothing to live for nor wake up every morning for. I am pretty much dead inside, I really have no more feeling or anything for anything."
1971,Are there times when suicide really is a better alternative?,In many cases suicide is never the answer however is it possible there are certain situations where suicide may be a better option?
1972,hanging by a thread,"'ve destroyed m relationship w/ my boyfriend Abdo, I've destroyed the friendship i had w/ people from school (wont get a reply from anyone) but i think i worst is - I've destroyed my spirit - ](*,)"
1973,I give up,"I am so tired. I can't stop crying. I have no one to talk too. I am a woman in her 40's and I wish I did not have to go on. There is not one aspect of my life that is worth living. My newly ex husband left me 2.7 years ago and I received my divorce decree in the middle of May. He just married the woman he left me for last week. I have been through therapy and a support group for it and I have accepted that he has left. I just don't have a life to move on to. I have high moral standards and I did not date one person while we were separated. Now I am free and men are not attracted to me. They act weird around me and it does not matter how friendly I am. I don't want to go on about this because it is not my only focus. I am working but barely making ends meet. I have a painful condition called RSD that prevents me from being able to go out and do the things I used to love before my accident in 1999. I am alone 90% of the time that I am outside of work. I go and see my parent's and siblings about once or twice a month but no one comes out to see me (I am half hour away from them) I have a few friends but they have busy lives and no time to see me. So is this all there is for me? Going to work to just be able to survive but I am in so much pain from my condition that I can't do a lot of things anyway. Just go to work and come home alone for the rest of my life. I wanted to join a local singles group but it cost money and they do a lot of activties that I can't do anyway. I have looked into EVERYTHING you can think of to try to survive in this miserable world and I am so tired and can't do it anymore. I am not successful, am barely surviving, in pain all of the time and no man will ever want me as is. What is there to live for?"
1974,I'm always desperately lonely...,"I’m a pathetic fourteen year old that has already given up on life. At the moment, I feel like a disgusting waste of space for hating my life and wanting to end it. I wish I could die so a more grateful person could live. At least then I wouldn’t be as selfish. Everyday feels blank, empty and lonely. I haven’t been hugged since I was six and I’m practically destroyed or ignored by my peers. The only way I can stop myself from crying for a moment, is to think of someone hugging me and telling me I’m not a waste of space but then I cry because I realise how pathetic I really am."
1975,my suicide,"i cant fight anymore, im finished....going far away where no one will ever find me, somewhere where ppl cant stop me....."
1977,I dont really know what to say,"All day today i kept on thinking after all this time that i couldnt keep this up. Ive been fighting with myself for such a long time. I just couldnt believe that my life turned out this way. I grew up in a really screwed up family structure with a culture that isnt educated enough to deal with their problems. All i really seem to know about my family is all the problems that they have. All my aunts and uncles that i grew up with all have attempted suicide. Its weird i feel like my whole life was the same rerun of like a real life horror movie or something. I never grew up being abused but my family was i guess. Also my mom once told me that every guy that she has been with has been abusive. Thats pretty hard to hear how now shes in her 40's. I dont really have a support system and ive never had anyone to talk to about my problems. Ive had to become my own therapist, my own best friend, my own motivator, my own coach in life."
1978,Please read before dying,"After holding it in for so long I couldn't help myself; I broke down in sobs today, thinking about someone whom I believe to be bent on taking her life and who has cut off all communication for over two months and counting. The following short poemy-type thing was born of the thought process I was going through at that moment:"
1979,In a world filled with people...,"Why do I find it so difficult to meet anyone. I'm 32 and for the last year I've been online visiting ""personals"" sites posting ads and responding to other people's ads. And yet, I'm still alone. Everyone acts like they want to meet you or chat further and then nothing. I never knew everyone was the same! I look to make friends and very few work out."
1980,talking about suicide & doing it?,Do you think people who talk about suicide never do it? Is that always true? Are there any cases where someone has talked about suicide and eventually did it?
1981,"thoughts of suicide, does everyone have them sometimes?",I am just curious if the average everyday person has thoughts of suicide? I don't mean just once or twice in a life time but thoughts of it that occur more often maybe say once a month to once every three months or so.
1982,"I hate waking up, sleep is my only relief","I don't know where to put this, but I guess given how I'm living, or not, I'll put it here. I just woke up 15 minutes ago and wish I could still be sleeping. It's the only relief I have in life. I have dreams that I'm with people and of this one person I used to love or of even some anonymous man who loves me and of beautiful places - then I wake up to the disaster that is my existence. I wake up wondering how I ended up in this spot and I've no idea how to change things at this point. I feel hopeless for the future and I think of just giving up and drinking wine to blot the pain, if only for another day. No, I actually do that. It works while I do it, but of course then I wake up and it's just another day. Part of me just feels like giving up completely, but there's still enough left inside for me to reach out - at least on this board."
1983,Never thought i would be coming this close,"My suicidal thoughts are not going away, i just got done working out, something, that usually reliefs some pain, and makes me alittle bit happy, i was thinking about ending my life the whole time and afterward, I feel like im actually gettting alot closer to actually doing this soon, the more i realistically think about my life, and where i will end up in 10 years the more i realise its nothing i want to stick around and experience. I look at my life, ways i can take it, things i can do, someone i can become, and i see nothing to live for, i have no love in my life, my mom/dad and i have a hollow relationship with no true love, i havent been in a serious relationship ever, and my friends are very distant, I seriously have nothing worth living for, i am not worth the oxygen i take up in this world, i feel like i am destined to kill myself, or just live a pathetic life. My moms dad killed himself at an old age, i think i would be just giving in to the way its meant to be for me"
1984,Im done,"I keep thinkin theres a light around the corner, but the more i turn a corner in life the more life reveals to me that its just gets worse and worse, I want to die, i hate being me"
1985,I dont know what to do.,For the past 2 years I have been unhappy and havnt gone a day without thinking * * * * it lets just do it and get it over with. I hate my life and I just want the pain to stop. I am only 17 years old at the moment and I feel like a complete * * * * ing loser. I feel this way because of my dad well thats my excuse anyways. Hes a complete * * * * ing * * * * and if I had the bottle I would kill him. Hes a control freak and I just want my pain to stop so he can feel guilty for all the * * * * hes put me through. I have Pills infront me right now and I really just wanna chuck them down my neck and get it over with. But something is telling me not to. I started crying today after an argument with my dad. Is crying weak? I picked up a blade and cut myself for the first time 5 times on my left wrist. I believe if my pain doesnt go away I will have killed myself within 3months.
1986,This Means Everything,"Is is possible for someone to look at his/her life and then decide that there really is no purpose to a continuance? Please take the time to look at this and let me know. Note: I am not active planning suicide (well, not a recent one anyway) and I am not looking for a self-confidence boost. I'm trying to be as clinical about this as possible."
1987,Get Help!,Hi guys
1988,giving up because I can't find anyone,"It takes so much effort to re-focus on other aspects of my life, to keep telling myself that even if my personal life is not what I want it to be, I can continue to live in other ways. I have just spent an abysmal night, and who knows I will spend many more, now that a promising prospect, a girl I had really started to get to know, has ended things."
1989,Just don't know where else to post this,"I hate feeling sorry for myself or coming off as emotional and whiny, but..."
1991,Question?,Can you really be depressed for no reason?
1992,Confused,I am really confused and upset.....was a witness to an elderly gentleman ending his life at the age of 80. As a eyewitness I just can not get the image of his broken body out of my mind. Finding myself asking many unanswerable questions that only he could have answered and feel like I am tormenting myself and going round and round in circles. In my job I work with children and volunteer with helplines dealing with a whole range of issues including suicide. Usually never knowing if we were able to help people as you do not usually receive the outcome of these problems. This gentleman reached 80 years of life and jumped at 6.30 in the afternoon from 11 floors.....the feeling of being so utterly helpless and useless is so overwhelming. I feel smacked in the face with a whole new reality of death!
1993,it is getting worse when you are getting older,"Hello, I am very depressed today, and want to talk with smb about it."
1994,why can't life be the way it was?,"Why can't life be like it was when we're young? When things weren't quite as complicated and people tended to be a little nicer and less hurtful, or if they were hurtful we weren't old enough to understand what they were saying was hurting us? I don't want this to be some angsty letter, but why does life turn out this way, when the only way of esaping the pain is to end it and keep it from coming back. And if it is such a nice escape why do people get so upset and not happy that they aren't hurting anymore? this is always such a negative subject. Yes it's yourself, but when you're in so much pain what much other choice do we have left? I think so often about this, and have wondered why I'm not yet. Any attempt I've survived. I don't want to be here, but I'm so afraid of people being sad. I don't want to hurt other people by doing this. I'm hurt, I'm broken, I'm alone, I want someone to tell me it will be alright, that I don't have to kill myself to end this hurt. I don't know what to do with myself anymore. I really don't want to kill myself, but it seems like it's the only way to end this. Please, someone just tell men things will get better. that getting my heart ripped out, it will still come back. That after being abused, it will stop. that after the name ccalling and bullying, they will learn to love. that even though it seems like no one cares, that there is someone out there who gives a flip wether I'm alive or not. (and yes for those that ask I do have a therapist.)"
1995,I feel terrible...,"I actually never pictured myself posting stuff in this part of the forums. I promised myself a while ago that I wouldn't think about it, but I'm thinking about it now..."
1996,Questions,Hello
1997,im tired of my life and how I am,i hate life so much
1998,God help me please,"well i survived again but im so confused, why am i unable to successfully end my life, what sort of a life is it when your mind is filled with constant thoughts of suicide?"
2000,Help..Please..,Thanks for opening.
2001,Back to zero,right now I'm back to where I started three years back.
2002,I just want to give up,Hey all.
2003,dying to hear from you,"hello all. I am writing because I have a lot of suicidal thoughts. Where to begin... anyways my story is a long one.. I think i may be either bi-polar or borderline personality disorder. My life can be defined as anxiety. I have very compulsive behavior. I have a problem with marijuana. I also think i have symptoms of ptsd (post traumatic stress disorder. I have been in a family quarrel for around 2 years and it eats away at me everyday. I am concerned because I have obsessive thoughts about killing myself, ones that i acted on a couple of years ago and are still here... I work in construction so any day I could just pick up a framing gun and put a nail in my temple... just like that! and its tempting. id say for the majority of the day i am thinking about killing myself. In a couple of weeks hopefully my insurance will have processed so i can see a professional. please give me some hopeful words I really hate life ](*,)"
2004,Od,I didn't OD to kill myself just so you all know - I did this because I wanted to sleep for a very long time - we all know that never works out how we planned.
2005,"It hurts for me to think that if I were to die, no one would care...","I don't really want this to turn into a pity fest, because right now I am not considering suicide. But I often feel lonely and like my life is not worth living. A few years ago, I did consider suicide and said to myself that if I were in the same position then at the age of 25 I would commit suicide. It's something that has laid in the back of my mind for a while now, but as I'm 23 I still have some time..."
2007,Where do i go from here..?,"I was just wondering if i could get some advise from others.... i have been depressed my whole life the only person who made happy was my grandmother, who passed away 6 years ago, ever since her dath my life has become a downward spiral that just keeps getting worse. not only do i feel depressed and sad everyday i keep it bottled up inside so no one will know. I always think about killing my self to end all the pain but i dont want to leave my parents with any burden. i feel like no one wants me around and my family has told me multiple times to just kill myself, especially my sister. i dont really have any friends, the only one i did have was my cousin but she no longer wants to be friends with me because my sister has drove her away. now i feel like im all alone in this world. i dont know why they hate me so much i try my best to be a good kid. I dont do drugs, i work full time to pay for school and all my expenses, i am a straight A student in pre med school and i get told all the time that i am an attractive girl. i just want to make them happy so i can be happy for once. i really cant take it anymore and i am just wondering what others would do in my situation or how should i deal with this...maybe killing my self is the best option."
2009,I told a friend tonight I hate god (I have my reasons),"I can't explain It, Not at all. I am seriously angery tonight, aswell as hurt, and suicidual. Previously tonight I told a friend I hate god. And I feel sick about it because I am a christian. I just have not been to church as much lattly."
2010,i'm suicidal,"Hello,"
2011,The moral dilemma of suicide...,This is something I've long thought about.
2012,death/God/hell,"Hi,"
2013,"I don't think I'll ever do it, but I am thinking about it...","...and it's mainly because I found out through the internet that my ex is now seeing someone after only 7-9 months of being broken up with me. I discovered this first through seeing a FaceBook image of her, and then I called her to get something back of mine, but while I had her on the phone I asked her if she was seeing someone else and she said yes."
2014,gotta make some serious changes,"I see suicide in my future unless i make changes in my life, the point i've been at the two years in life have led me closer and closer to suicide, i've hit rock bottom in many aspects of my life. Basically i've got issues which i really hate and that bother me, and i haven't quite figured out what to make of them or how to solve them, anyway the idea that i can figure my self out and change my life and my ways to find happiness is keeping me going at this point, the thing is i see my future as going two ways, succeeding or failing, im either going to work out my issues and find some direction, or else im gonna find myself at the same place i am now 10 years from now, if that the case i definitely see suicide as happening. I know its never an answer to problems but if in fact my life looks the same as it does now, if my issues are still unresolved and i still cant find happiness well then i will commit suicide simply because i dont want my life anymore, its wont be that im trying to solve my problems at that point if no progress has been made on my part i wouldnt see them as problems anymore just facts of my life that wont change, if thats the case well then i truly dont want to live as me anymore. I hope that doesnt happen and i wish i had the optimism to say that I KNOW! its not gonna be the case because i wont let it! unfortunately life continues to remind me that its real, not some fairytale where hard work is always rewarded and good people always prosper, the real world consists of good people getting hit by cars and evil people making millions, theres really no moral balance or guidelines to how the hands in life are dealt, sometimes your given a bad hand, sometimes your given a good hand, sometimes you can turn a bad hand into a good hand, sometimes you can work all your life to change your bad hand into a good one but realize that it doesnt always workout, the world has no balance or fairness, Karma is BS, fundamentalist are dreamers, wake up, life is living,moving, organic, its doesnt play by rules or ideas or romantic words, it goes where ever its pushed, im sorry im so cynical today, but my life is very cynical"
2015,I keep thinking about it...,"Firstly, im not going to commit suicide. So, please dont worry or anything. I will keep posting! I will stick around. Even if i didn't, it doesn't matter anyway-you don't know me, and it is not your duty. Still, im not going anywhere.......i really want to see The Dark Knight for starters. However, i can't stop thinking about death. I've reached a point where i don't see the point of life anymore. Almost as if life itself is just nothing in comparison to the scheme of things overall. I keep wondering what happens after you die. And, it's no longer thoughts grounded in how others would react, or how many people would go to my funeral, because i no longer care about that. I'm just sick of life. It's tiresome, and i would love to sit somebody worse off than me, and ask them ""how do you keep going?"". If it were not socially weird and messed up, i would have asked the wheelchair bound customer as to how he keeps going? What keeps him alive?"
2016,tired of worrying,"Im in need of advice ,Ive been feeling really low lately Ive also have had thoughts of suicide,but Ive never went through with it..I just feel as though my life has no purpose Im fighting a battle that I can't win.Im just so tired of trying to achive something and getting no where in life.Im trying to get my GED but I always seem to fail the math portion hired a tutor and Im still unsure about if Im going to pass it .I come from a very dysfunctional family I do not get alone with any of my realtives,they always have the ability to make me feel stupid .Ive lied to them about having my GED in hopes of them accepting me but nothing works.... Im tired of trying to be accepted by these people.The only support I have is my husband and they dislike him also...I want to have a good job .....Im tired of being a nobody... Im sick of living this life this way. My husband has a great job and is very out going and Im nothing like that..... I feel like a thorn in my husbands side I wish I could be all the things he deserves instead of this shell of a woman that I am ....Its hard having a learnng disability I just want to be normal"
2018,Who gets over it?,"I just read a thread where a young man left us. Some people were saying his parents would never get over it, which I fully understand. How could they? My question is, if people can say that about their situation why do people say that I am going to ""get over it""? Why is that? Because she wasn't my child? She was just my partner? What's the difference? I can't see any. Yet people tell me all the time....""You'll get past this, you'll get over it, things will get better"".....How, exactly? Time doesn't heal everything. That's a crock of crap. Would these people say the same thing to his parents whilst secretly thinking that it was the end of their lives? Why lie?"
2019,no heart/spirit/soul - y live?,"i dont kno how much longer i can keep my life afloat - im getting sicker physically and emotionally i am spiraling down into the bottomless pit -- im not really eating anymore, i have no motivation and only thoughts of suicide and how/when/where im gonna do it -- my body is falling apart as well as my mind - i feel like im going crazy and maybe i am -- Ive self injured the inside of my mouth to the point i almost cant take the pain - but nothing relieves the pain i am hiding deep down inside my soul -- i dont even really kno to do about that - all i do kno is that its there and its eating me from the inside out....i no longer have a heart, spirit or soul.....y should i live?"
2020,Is suicide ever the answer?,"I am 22 years old, unemployed and haven't had any friends or social contacts since I was 15. I'm taking a math class at college since math is the only thing I have confidence in."
2021,I want to die!!!,"This song explain how i feel exactly, every sentence, every word --"
2022,Suicide is it a better choice?,"Life is so hard i have no friends to talk with in my real life, my cyber life is finally diminished i feel as if my inner self is gone, suicide seems like the best answer. No one notices my silent plea and i prefer it that way it makes my life feel even more insignificant suicide seems like a very sweet embrace im not afraid of death i think it will just be like going to sleep... how i love sleep and whenever i wake up i dread that day, sleep is closing ur eyes and you basically dont exist until you wake up again... unless u have dreams... my dreams are dead and i think i will be better off that way also... death is nothing to fear it is the same as going to sleep."
2023,Despair and coping.,I wish I could just stop existing. But since that isn't going to happen anytime soon...
2024,Urge to Jump,"Hi,"
2025,Should I be ashamed?.,No I have no plans on commiting suicide.
2027,its just keeps coming back and keeps killing everything,"Im so incredibly lonely. Not because no one is here, its because no one is there. Ive never felt like this before, so utterly desolate. My heart is aching because I truly know that everyone will feel relief rather than upset. How did I do that? I love my children, I do but im so tired, tired of fighting this. Of fighting to have a life. I wish id never been born. I enjoyed pieces of it but overall I feel I failed dismally. Motherhood was the only thing I really wished to succeed at and I managed to mess it up 3 times running by succumbing to this illness. If I had one wish…it would be that my mother had not had me so that I could have been spared this and spared everyone else."
2028,I have a gun,"I'm so close. ](*,)"
2029,To those i leave im sorry,"I have been working with a psi for a few weeks now which is why i havent been here i wanted to see if there really was any other way if things could be different, but sadly they are not they are just the same, 2 weeks ago i found myself sat on a bridge and felt no fear just a need to leave , something deep within made me call the samaritans and they talked to me and stopped my plan by calling me a taxi and i went to them."

2041,feeling down and suicidal,"it feels like the ground has been pulled from beneath me and i just keep falling, endlessly into a void. It is overwhelming, and the only time i don't feel it is when I am sleeping at night. But i don't really sleep, I just go off into this other world of constant disturbing dreams. I have been thinking about suicide all day,every day for two months now, and haven't slept right all that time. I don't care how i look anymore, i hate mirrors, i dont want to look at my face. My stomach hurts alot and when i go into public i am extremely uncomfortable, thinking that people are staring at me and don't like what they see."

2056,Father Committed Suicide - How to cope?,Back in February my Dad shot himself he had been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and depressed because his GF had taken all his money and left him alone - He had been threatening for over a year to shoot himself and I didn't really believe he would go through with it. I visited him a few times but not many he and I did not have a good relationship after my parents divorced he stole my Mom's car and had our house foreclosed on right after I got out of high school - but he was lonely and I felt bad so I visited him a few times- He was in the hospital right before he did and I didn't go up to see him I was in the state going out with some of my high school friends and I didn't want to be depressed by him- awful right but he was a lot to take very negative and hard to deal with - while in the hospital he had threatened to kill himself so they transferred him to a city hospital who he convinced he was sane and they let him out and 8 days later he's dead - I keep having nightmares were I see him dead face down on the floor and it's really vivid and I haven't been able to sleep much and on top of that Im having problems with my BF and I guess maybe it's stress- but how have other people coped with suicide? That's my General Question I suppose -
2057,Feeling like hell,"I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like hell and like I can't go on anymore. My mum is going to jail, my only remaining good friend is living abroad and I miss her so much. When I am with her I feel so different and alive and I so wish I could be with her. I don't know what to do with my life...I feel so lonely and empty inside."
2058,Corruption...,"I enjoy perhaps complaining about life on this forum. It's a nice release. A sort of escape from depression. For just a few minutes, but it's probably the happiest few minutes of my life."
2059,Parents think friend is my gf. sometimes i really hate them!,"pretty much the only friend i have right now happens to be female. she must be my gf then, right? i'm obviously so desperate i'm seeing someone i don't find remotely attractive. No, actually."
2060,Tell meh...is anything worth it?,Seems to be working out anymore. The fact that i dont have a best friend...and i cant trust anyone really makes me depressed. And also the fact am ugly and fat i hate too.
2061,book recommendation-'How I stayed alive when my brain was trying to kill me',One Person's Guide to Suicide Prevention: Susan Rose Blauner
2062,Depressed thinking,"Throughout every moment of consciousness, I find myself overwhelmed with depression, loneliness, and the sense that I linger in the middle ground between invisibility and nonexistence. My waking hours are spent in the constant search of distractions, not simply to avoid the regrets and mistakes that haunt my thoughts but more importantly, to stave off the short-lived day dreams that cruelly tempt me with joy, hope, and unbridled optimism. In those fleeting seconds, my eyes glaze over and my mind drifts toward places that I’ve never been, back to conversations that never happened, and into an intimate embrace with a perfect moment during which all potentials, all possibilities are fulfilled. In those fleeting seconds, I cease to be me. Even with the memories of thousands of days behind me, I fondly dwell only upon these dreams. To lose myself within them, utterly, completely, and uncontrollably is the only thing to which I look forward as well as the thing I fear the most. As wonderful as they are, the only constant, certainty, and uniformity within their variety is the fact they will always end. When this occurs, I am left alone and suddenly disconnected again in my empty world, with my face lost in the crowd, my voice drowned in the silence, and my heart beating just fast enough to keep me alive."
2063,I'm so paranoid that she'll do it,Some of you may have read about my ex who broke up with me because of her depression. She is on medication and seeing a councillor every week. She is now going out with another guy. I really need help.
2064,I want to 'do it'!,"Partly because I'm depressed and finding it very difficult to focus, and partly because its an option. An option just like being a 'graduate teacher 'is an option for me once I graduate with my masters."
2066,Empty?,So just recently my mother found nude photos..
2067,"Thank You, all","I cannot stand the nature of existence. It purely disgusts me. We are all enslaved by the necessity of money. Slavery is not abolished in America, the noose was simply loosened and it is now called capitalism. We've got pictures of slaveowners on our money, for pete's sake. Think about that for a moment. We go to work to receive a little baseball card of a slaveowner that we then have to fork over to the electricity company so that we can see what we are doing inside our homes when the sun goes down. This drives me insane! I am not 100% bitter towards the government for the system that's in place, the real target of my hatred and bitterness is mother nature and the tendencies of the universe."
2069,Suicide thoughts,"I been thinking about suicide for a couple of months now...these thoughts often comes and go but for the last couple of months ive been thinking about it seriously...not even when im depressed or anything. I dont know whats going on but im really scared of being hurt, im scared of being hurt by gf/family/friends..."

2077,Only option is dying,hi all.
2080,Very distraught,"Long story short I am a 25 year old male and I still live at home. I have been depending on my Mom for a long time. Anyway, she basically bought my car for me a few years ago (took a loan out to do it) and I would pay her in installments but for the most part she paid for it all. Well, I wrecked that car today and it's my fault. The insurance people are gonna come out tomorrow and give us an estimate. We are guessing we will only get around 3 or 4 grand for it because of the mileage. My Mom has basically told me she will not cosign for me to get a loan and get a new car. She shuts down every idea I have. I had made plans to get an apartment in the fall with my gf, to go back to school, etc. And she just always goes back and forth and say's I can't do this, I can't do that, etc."
2081,My life (warning big wall of text),"Hi my name is David. I have spent most of my life not knowing what was going on around me until now and I wish I didn't. I never understood why my parents fought all the time. Why I would be taken to my grandparents out of the blue. When I was 15 or so, I found out the reason I went to my grandparents out of no where from time to time. My mom was bipolar and a manic depressive. I never understood what was wrong with her. My Dad blamed it on her for stopping her medicine, and my grandma(on my moms side) blamed my dad. I felt like i was placed in the middle of war sometimes. Between my moms side of the family and my dads."
2082,feeling bad,hi all i am very suicidal and i think about it 4-5 times a day i feel i cannot go for help as ppl will laugh at me .. before you all laugh at me this is a cry for help as i feel i can get it no were else im normally a strong person but over the last 3 moths this felling has grown stronger i have my death all mapped out in my head but dont know why ... what is happening i dunno
2083,Does anyone else feel they're in *this* situation?,"Hi,"
2084,Suicide would just make me happy...I don't deserve happy,"What ever it is I have done: I deserve to live here in this Hell. Suicide would just make me happy. I don't deserve happiness. So I guess it's safe to say I deserve this, I deserve to suffer. I made this bed in life, I had to suffer the consequences, right?"

2092,for those of you who are feeling hopeless..,Take a look at this:
2093,epic pain,"well here i am, on the edge again."
2094,when things just get worse,"I don't know what you do when you feel like since last fall you life has become particularly bad, and has been bad all your life, and has been bad forever, and will always be. I just don't know. I want to just be past all the pain, all sorrow, and not remember anything. I just want to be dead. I want to cut and cut and cut and get blood all over and slice into myself until I am still or until I feel like enough is enough. I just want not to have to struggle, try or worry. I am sure no one would care, I live my life alone, just a face and a name to people. I don't want to see another dawn, another day. I just want peace- I would seek this peace in life, but I am beginning to see that's not possible, nothing ever changes."
2095,Suicide by psychopaths?,"A lot of people don't commit suicide directly. Some do it by cop. I am wondering if it is possible to be wanting it indirectly like this, in some subconscious form where you are not aware of it, to be influencing your decisions to continue doing things which you know are dangerous yet you keep doing them, despite not wanting these risks."
2096,no ones who i thought they was.,"and i cant deal with all the shizzle i get from them. i thought i had found a nice guy, and earlier he tells me he hopes i die."
2097,It's a mess,"Sometimes I can see the world from far away, as if I were standing on the surface of the moon, and I can see the Earth moving tremendously fast - imagine if the speed by which the Earth travels around the sun were the speed that the sun traveled around the center of the galaxy. And when things are moving this fast, I can see very far back in time, to the moment that the first organisms developed in the ocean and soon began to crawl on land - and this is all seen at lightning-fast speed, remember - and then life spreads accross Earth like a fungus or a moss, a giant biologically-diverse lichen that thrives by coastal, fertile regions but can be sustained also in environments of extreme heat, cold, wetness and dryness. I see all this and I don't feel any different from a tree or a wolf or a goddamned dandelion. In theory this is a beautiful feeling. But the expectations upon me are quite different from that of a tree or a wolf or a dandelion. Not only am I expected to do the big things - graduate college, get a decent job, find a decent house, marry a decent woman and raise decent children - but all the little things that fill up every moment in the interim. Talking, for example: I'll have to talk almost every day of my life until I die. I'll have to engage in conversation and talk about how this is doing or how that is doing and what needs to be done about this and what seems wrong about that. I'll have thousands of questions asked by people I don't want to give answers to; and in all probability, I'll often ask questions to people who would rather not give the answers to me. Both experiences are enough to warrant the Big Quit. I have panic attacks on what may be a regular basis, and I don't expect them to stop without medication - but is it wiser to curb the panic attacks, or their source? Ideally I would live a life where I entertained no thoughts and had extremely limited interaction with the human world. So I could become Taoist or Buddhist and meditate in the ruins of an ancient hillside monastery. Or I could wait out what is most certainly a dark phase that comes with being 22 and pretty soon I'll fall in love or something pleasant like that and forget all about the tremendous, crushing beauty of the structure of life on this planet. We are organisms at the end of the day, and my job is to pass on my specific strain of DNA into the big machine so it may determine what organic strategy is best for the present. And once I do, my job will be done, and I will bend down on my hands and knees so my genetic likeness can spring forward from my back and fly into the big mess. I can't kill myself and I can't kill anyone else, so do I let my mind tear itself apart and meanwhile maintain a fragile facade of contentness? Or maybe I do kill myself, like I've thought about; I've tested attaching my belt to the ceiling; I've held the knife against my wrists and the sharp pressure on my skin; I've pretended to jump off bridges for the amusement of my friends, the joke always rising first from desire; I even wrote a song once, while drunk, about jerking the wheel. Many of my friends tell me I think too much when I try to talk about the nature of life on Earth because of the conclusions I come to - but to ignore it would feel like surrender. Maybe if I wait a bit longer all the things that seem terrible will make some kind of poetic-galactic sense. Either way, the days keep getting worse."
2098,my last cry for help,I guess I'll have to start from the beginning...
2099,Life Insurance and suicide,Does anyone know about life insurance and suicide?
2102,a note on suicide,"a couple days ago, i found out a guy i knew from grammar school tried to commit suicide. his brother and roommate were out somewhere and he called to say goodbye. they rushed home to try to stop him and found him hanging and had to cut him down. he wasn't dead, but in a coma. i found out just a little while ago that they decided to take him off life support tonight. as far as i know, no one knows why he did it. i barely knew this guy because he was a couple years younger than me, but im devastated nonetheless."
2103,Afraid dream will become reality..,So I had a horrible dream last night about my ex.

2106,The Bridge: documentry on suicide on Golden Gate Bridge,you can find the movie in google video
2108,When is it alright?,Alright I'm having a tough time wondering on what action if any I should do..
2109,Feeling Low Depressed and Hate My Life.....Why?,"Ok, here is the thing I've just recently made a big move over here to Canada from the U.K, living in Toronto Ontario, it isnt going too bad, made some friends and now finally after 6 months of living here got a girl friend, so why am I thinking about ending my own life?"
2110,I am very unhappy,"I really want to cry but I can't, even though I doubt it will do anything. I am far from happy right now. I guess you can say it's cause off the breakup, but I truly do not know. It could be more. I am trying to arrange to see a doctor even though I am scared. I Am scared off being put on drugs I guess. But I am very depressed. And it just keep getting worse."
2111,thinking of it,"been thinking of it for a while, and no i need help but its really hard to find. everything just starts going bad. the one person i truly loved, my grandma, is now in her death bed with cancer. Im in the Army and have now been blamed for a whole entire Marijuana conspiracy when i dont even smoke the stuff. so i might get dishonorable discharge. then i can never find a job again. the army was all i had and thought that could change me. but now it hasnt, its only made things worse. there is nothing left for me here. nobody would miss me, so thats what made me really think of it."
2113,A different approach...,"Hi. My name is Elizabeth. Last year I tried to kill myself the day after Thanksgiving. At that point, I'd been depressed for a very long time and was done with living. I'd been cutting myself and taking large amounts of pills (stuff like ibuprofen and Tylenol, not heavy stuff) to make myself feel better. Anyway, I failed my attempt and was sent to the hospital, where I ended up working out some issues and getting myself set up with a councilor and getting put on meds. It worked for a time... but deep down I knew I wasn't really well. I recently stopped taking the meds because I don't like the fact that I can only be happy when medicated, it doesn't feel normal or right. Now I'm miserable and I'm losing my will to live. My grades are dropping and I feel like I'm losing my friends, and my family life gets worse all the time. I want to make things better, but it's like my brain is saying ""We need to get moving Elizabeth..."" and the rest of me is saying ""Whats the point?"". Honestly, I don't really think suicide will make it ""better"", but I feel like it'd be best to end it now so it can't get any worse."
2114,This is it,I'm done. I love this forum and it's resources. I'm gone.
2115,not doing so good i just want to end this pain,ive tried ive failed ive had enough please just let me go

2126,My past is haunting me,"[B]Here's the background I became suicidal after the first time I left the university exactly 4 years ago, I had an awful job back then and it always made me feel like I was worth nothing, I used lot's of alcohol, felt bad about not having a girlfriend, no real friends at all... I wrote a lot of suicide notes, I wanted to jump from a high bridge into the river (I can't swim and thereforeeee it was 100% sure that I'll drown when I do it) - I had lot's of fantasies on how to kill myself..."
2127,im lost and need help,"I feel so ashamed that I'm even thinkink these thoughts that I have again. I want to be done with this. It's not fair all I really want is to be happy and I do want to stick around to see what might be out there for me, but a lot of the times I think there isn't going to be anything there for me. Why isn't it enough just to love someone? Why does a person make it so hard for another to love that person? Why do they always run away?"

2134,Something to think about..,This post is for anyone contemplating ending their life. Particularly for those people who believe that they have nobody in this world who cares for them or who would miss them.
2135,Does anyone feel the same?,"Hi everyone,"
2137,This time of year is tough for me...,"I read a post last night that linked me to the final thread of Chris, the fellow that posted on here for a while and then took his own life. It triggered something inside me that is always there...has been there probably since the day I found my mother in the back seat of her car, some 35 years ago."
2138,"age,unemployed,no communicating family=nothing left","My ability to talk to someone who listens and cares has escaped me and I am not sure I want or can experience another year of being alone. I miss my wife tremendously as well as my son and daughter and grandchildren. There seems to be no reason to try , as I seem to get kicked in the teeth everytime I start to achieve or get momentum headed in a positive direction."
2139,Need help really bad..,"Okay.... Me and my girlfriend have been going out for a yeear, i realize im really young(14) but i really love her more than anything, We've been having sex for about 6 months now, and we've been doing that a lot lately..She told me she wanted to take a break that we were always fighting and doing that too much and i love her so much it's crazy i'm so confused she also told me she kinda liked this other guy but she doesnt anymore....I'm so depressed i just want it to end, she promised me we would be together forever and she would never ever break up with me, maybe i love her more than she loves me idk, i keep thinking about just comitting suicide and ending it all... At first i told her about it but now she's all worried and says she loves me more than anything,,, i dont even know if that is true because i think she just doesnt want me to hurt myself... i don't want her to fake loving me, idk im confused please help me..."
2142,Slowly dying inside,I have been depressed since I was 12. I had something very traumatic happen in my childhood and I only realised how wrong it was when I was 12. In that time of my life I met a girl a very lovely girl and throughout the years I broke down alot and this girl became my lover and was always there for me and was my only means for support as my parents did not understand how much pain I was in. 2 Years ago the love of my life moved away to Montana USA. I missed her dearly and we argued a lot as my depression got worse. She left me 3 months ago.
2143,I find no meaning in life.,"This isn't really me asking for anyone to help me find it. I already know there is none. I just needed to vent a little bit. It's like 3 in the morning, I'm just feeling upset. I don't have anything that keeps me interested. I hate myself for the things I've done, I've attempted suicide before. No, I didn't tell anyone about it. My stupid a$$ just didn't take enough pills to make it work, so I ended up in a mental ward for almost a week. I'm supposed to be in therapy, but I don't have the money, and I think therapists are BS anyways. I'm apathetic about everything. Well, almost. Idk, I just can't be happy. Or when I am happy, it's like a ridiculously high amount of happiness, then I get miserably depressed. I know, you're thinking bipolar, already been diagnosed with it. I guess some people are just hopeless. Oh wells. Thanks for listening I appreciate it"
2144,I don't really know what to say.,I'm 19 years old
2145,The Loss of Someone Special,Hey everyone -
2146,Just another generic 'I dont want to be here anymore' threads.,"You've all heard it a million times. Or perhaps, maybe, you've thought of it yourself a million times."
2147,I tried to killmyself.,"I believe you guys still remember me, right...?"
2148,"why am i writing this,","i dont even know why im writing to you guys, not one even cares anymore, so many people are fed up with people telling others about thier suicide stories and hoping to get some help, when in reality nothing ever matteres enymore. i feel that even though at this moment i want to blow my brains out and break my neck hoping to snap it and hopefully die a slow painful death, no one even will even care. cuz guess what, we are all alone anyways. and we all die eventually. so why does everone pretend to care so much? thats what i wanna know"
2149,Bad Emotions,"I didn't do so well this semester in school, but I certainly didn't do terrible. I usually have about a B average, but I sort of slacked off this semester. I ended up with an A, B-, C, and and Incomplete (because I didn't turn in all of my hours of field work for my co-op, even though I completed them). I'm bargaining with the teacher to fix my Incomplete, but it's been difficult to get a hold of her because of the holidays."
2150,Overdose...,How long does it take for an overdose to enter your system?
2151,can't find the hope,"I posted this in the ""grief"" section, too, but as no one is really responding, i thought i'd post here. i'm not feeling well. i don't know what to do anymore. i'm grieving so many things...i've lost so much that i think i'm losing myself now. i'm so sad that i don't know if i can go on."
2152,Helping a friend,I have a friend who has been very determined to become a doctor. But after 3 years of trying to get into med school he has had failure after failure after failure and it seems that he has decided that he needs to give up.
2153,what is the point ?,"im a burden to myself and to those around me im not winning im just one of those people that is viewed as no not her again, but im dying inside, now all i need to to die outside to and please before anybody tells me how selfish that is can i please politely say that you havnent lived my life , i love my family very much im just no use to them or anybody else like this"
2155,I cant stop..someone help me please,"I have been playing this online game called World of Warcraft. I have been playing 8-9 hours straight, and I cannot seem to quit it. Something inside me is telling me just to end life, and go to heaven. I do not know why, but this game addiction keeps growing, and I need it to stop. I cannot go to counciling, because I am too scared. People around me taunt me and tease me about it, and Im ready to go. Someone, please tell me what to do.."
2156,Newbie hi everybody,dont really know what to say im a complete mess i need to talk and cant thoughts of endng my life are rife i have had them before managed them and come out the other side but this is different i cant seem to think of anything else i have a family and im trying so hard right now to focus on them but i cant do it anmore im lost alone helplass useless i just want to leave im in so much pain and torment perhaps someone can help?
2157,So tired of fighting,"and wondering what's the point anymore. I'm a single mum to 3 kids, have 5 but 2 eldest live elsewhere. Was in an abusive marriage for nearly 15 years and only broke free of it a few years ago now but seems everytime I manage to get things together along comes something else to knock me back down, seems i can;t escape my past I'm just so tired of struggling through each day, putting on a brave face to those around me when really i'm in turmoil. Nights are worse, kids are in bed have too much time to dwell on things, focusing on the bad, thinking how easy it would be to end it all, to stop the pain and jsut not wake up."
2158,Haha what a joke. Why am I here,"My FI cancelled the wedding and said now we have different priorities. my life offically sucks. My marriage was my one bright star in my frikn cr@ppy life, other than my daughter. I hate myself. I hate my life. I hate that everything I try fails. I hate that people don't see me for who I am. I hate that I'm here physically with no purpose but am tortured every day. If it weren't for my daughter this would be so easy a decision. Just take me now."
2159,Close to Giving Up,Everyday for the past five years I have been bullied.
2160,Lonely,"-=Please, I need some honest answers so I will give honest information.-="
2161,i like being on my own but hate being lonely,"i feel safe and relaxed on my own at home, and when i go out i feel uncomfortable, stressed and self-conscious. but i hate the loneliness, and it makes me suicidally depressed."
2162,Thx,"thanks for your suport enotalone but unfortunately there is no help for me and my md .. i have planed to get drunk and suacide my self for new year eve,, 08 ,, bye bye"
2163,Feeling very down,"Hi guys, i am new to enotalone but have been reading alot of threads. My gf broke up with me about 7 weeks ago and i am seriously struggling with depression. it was a very serious relationship and now that i look back i always did suffer from slight depression and this drained her. she issues also didnt help as seeing her down in the dumps made me feel even worse. i talked to her in person about 2 weeks ago and explained what i was goin thru and how i am so sorry that it affected her like this. ii was unaware of what was happening as it was a long distance relationship and she also had many issues of her own so instead of looking at my self for the problem i just blamed what was easy. i told her that i dont blame her for getting rid of me and that i didnt deserve her. she said there may be a chance for us in the future and that she would like to stay friends. i then called her a few days ago and she was very bitter towards me and even somewhat resentful. it hurts so much knowing that she now resents me. i am scared that she will always resent me. The truth is we both had our part in it ending but i blamed myself entirely and told her this. She is now moving on very well and doing alot of positive things. i am very happy for her. i am stuck in a hole that seems to be getting deeper and deeper. i pretty much just lay in bed all day dwelling on all the things i did to end the relationship."
2164,"On Dec 14, it will have been one year...",...since my friend comitted suicide.
2165,"Well, Yeah","F***. I didn't do it, though I was going to. I still want to. So, for that I say f***."
2166,I can't be a bad life,I am 19 and in my second year of college.
2168,Please leave your trying-to-convince-me-not-to at the door.,"Hey everyone! I, um, well I want to kill myself. I used to think about it a lot out of anger and stress. But it's different now. I seriously just want to die. I honestly believe I've lived my life to the fullest. I want more, though. My parents and the government just keep getting in the way. I want to be free. I feel like I'm locked up. I don't expect anyone to understand. And I know everyone on here is just going to tell me not to do it. But that's not what I want to hear. I'm just sick of everything. I want to be able to control myself and I'm so frustrated that people are holding me back. My mom believes she controls every * * * * ing aspect of my life. If that were the way it was supposed to be, why would I be able to control MYSELF (physically and mentally). I'm just done. IT's as if everywhere I turn, no one is there to help me. Everything is filled with ""I'll talk to you later about it""'s or ""You're not serious""'s or ""It will pass""'s. But it won't. I'm just so sad. I'm hurt. I'm done."
2169,suicide seems inevitable,"I'm 21 right now and suicidal thoughts have always only been an escape, a fantasy. Circumstances in my life have brought to a point where I think about suicide alot though. Started in my teens and knowing my life was going to get really painful at around my age suicide has always been a thought of mine. As my life becomes more and more uncomfortable/ stressful and I cannot forget or use simple things to make my life more bearable, suicide is coming closer. The issues I have and have had for a while are beginning to show themselves more and more with age. Only the prospect of becoming a totally different person has given me hope for the future, but as I age I realize I cannot change these circumstances,they're personal,mental, not things i can change. So as my life is not so stressful to where Ive killed myself already I see in the future where I will not be able to escape anymore and I will kill myself. The day seems to come closer everytime I slip back into a deep depression/realization of reality and whats really up with me. The truth is that I dont want to be who i really am, but pretending to be someone else won't keep me going. I feel that suicide is inevitable for me, that by not killing myself now is just delaying the future. Coming to terms with my issues would mean becoming someone I cannot live with. I feel that my mind/soul are trapted in the wrong body and I should do myself a favor and let my body decay and recycle and my mind/soul to just die, or move-on which ever happens to the mind/soul. Sorry bout the grammar, semester just got out, I feel like I owe it to myself to take a break on proof reading and grammar today"
2170,Suicidal Boyfriend,"Last night i decided to talk to my boyfriend about our relationship and how i've been finding a few things that he does kind of unexceptable. I kept the conversation as light as possible as i was scared of his reaction. You see my boyfriend is fairly unstable and has had suicidal tendencies in the past, despite this, i felt that i couldn't hold back how i was feeling any longer. Anyway as i was talking he strarted to tell me that ""i should just forget about him"" and that ""everyone would be better off without him"". I started to panic, as these are the first warning signs that he wants to commit suicide. Usually at this stage i would give up, take back everything i had been saying, but last night i felt that i couldn't give in to his threats and so i carried on with my point. However things got worse and he started to really sacre me by saying that ""he was really going to to it this time"" it was after this that he hung up on me, which made me absolutly terrified, i mean how do you cope if someone kills themself because of something you said? So i immediately called him back and luckly he answered. I begged and pleaded with him not to do anything stupid and told him that i didn't mean what i had been saying. It didn't help though and he told me he was sitting in the bath and all he needed now was for me to put the fone down. Obviously i wasn't going to do that so i made a plan that if he was to hang up on me i would call his house fone and tell his parents. As i was listening to him mumbling about how much better off people will be, i think i started to have a panic attack - my body started to uncontrolably twitch and spasm, i found it extremly difficult to breath and my words wouldn't come out of my mouth. I've never experienced anything like it before. My boyfriend heard what was happening to me and it must have brought him to his sense slightly as he promised to get out of the bath and started to calmed down."
2171,self destruction,For just over a year now I've been having random thoughts of killing myself and since July they've been coming up atleast once a day. and for about 3 months now I've slowly been killing myself I'll eat (on a good day) one meal a day that if nearly all sugar and when I drink something it's always pop or an energy drink this is to help me stay awake for the mass amounts of time I'm normally awake then when I sleep its for about 1-2 hours.
2172,I have decied to leave before christmas,"I have decided that things for me wont change i will alays feel his way andi am not of any e to anyone by stying. my partnr has left us this week as well, he says that he cant deal with the thought of chemo not working and me going ."
2173,Dazed and Confused,"I'm writing this in a state of mind where confusion and depression are the dominant emotions, so I'm not sure if any of this well make sense, or at least, won't be very articulate."
2174,The way i feel,I've let you down
2175,Thoughts.....,It is odd but recently I will have thought about suicide daily. They just sort of creep into my mind. I can envision myself doing it. I know for a fact I would never actually do such a thing. Is this just because I am going through hard times? Anyone else have any thoughts on this?
2176,I can't do this anymore,"After being dumped by my first boyfriend and lover at 26 I've gone in a downward spiral. Antidepressants aren't helping. Therapy is not helping. I can listen to all of the positive, uplifting podcasts in the world but nothing is making me feel better. I won't say that the break-up cause all of this. Obviously all of this was inside me before I even met him. I felt okay (not really happy but okay) about my life before I met him, and I was on cloud 9 when I was with him...I thought life couldn't get any better. I didn't really see it coming when he dumped me because he gave me the impression he cared about me and missed me. In any case this lose only solidifies my belief that no man can ever love me and that I'm worthless (it took me until 26 to even get a boyfriend. You always hear about kids on the playground with boyfriends or girlfriends--I never even had that)."
2177,Again...,"I've been in and out of suicide thoughts for about a year now. And i'm only 14!!. I bin drinking all weekend. I'm scared. I think I need to go to C.A.T.C for a few days. But how do I tell my mom this? I just can't stop the thoughts, and I can't sleep at all. I just sit in my room, on my computer, listening to sad songs, and thinking about killing myself. How should I tell my mom about this?? I don't know what to say or anything...I need somebody opinion. Maybe someone who's been through this all ready. Please help me."
2178,The only way,I can't live anymore. It's too painful. I have no control over these feelings. Everything I've done to try and control them has failed. The world is a * * * *ty place anyway and I've always felt like a freak who doesn't belong here.
2179,Questions,"Hello,"
2180,Looking for assistance.,"Look, I'm not looking for support in not committing suicide nor am I looking for a reason to not do it."
2181,skydive with no parachute,"i dont know why im writting this, i dont exactly want to. but here goes nothing."
2183,Depression reccurence?,Im not suicidal but this seems like the most appropriate forum section to post in.
2184,My last straw,"I'm at wits end with everything, with work, with love and everything. People don't understand me, they don't know how I feel. I'm sick of everything. Night 2 on cutting. Maybe I'll just drink alcohol and take some pills. I just wanna go.. just wanna erase myself......from everything"
2185,Im drowning in my own emotions,i have finally told my coucellor about my fathewr and what he did to me but im drowning in mixed emotions the only good thing that has come out of telloing her is that she now says that she can understand the suicidal thoughts ive had that ive been trapped for years ith no where to go so suicide is a clear option
2186,"17 year old, lost one love......dont know where i'll go in life.",I am 17 and live in London. My dream is to be a footballer and my back up is economics.
2187,"push, shove, and off they go!","I have been depressed since I was 9 years old. I have kept it to myself mainly, got help and prescriptions but promptly took myself off them. They made me feel worse because I needed them."
2188,hey music guy,"I often wonder why I wake up in the morning. Why I live each day. I've thought of suicide ever since I was 13. Countless times I'd hurt myself. Almost got kicked out of school because of it. Parents divorced at 13, my only brother left at 17, rarely do I get to talk to him. I'm no close to my dad, very close to my mom. Women and relationships are a disaster. People call me ""weird"" constantly, even though I have no idea what makes me weird. Music makes me happy, that's it. I've thought about dong drugs or getting super drunk ( even though I can't drink because of my liver) I've always wanted to be a dad and be a good husband, if not that, be in some sort of long term relationship. I've tried the whole ""don't find love, it'll find you"" business (doesn't work ). I've tried dating offline and online (that doesn't work either)"
2189,Oh bother.,"It seems as if life is no longer worth living. I hate sounding emo-depressive, but that is how I feel. Growing up I never imagined I would ever be where I am now. I always thought I had a relatively good life. I guess I do, really. I suppose my angst and emo-depressive thoughts stem from my broken heart..."
2190,Dont know what to do..,I've been having suicidal ideation for the past week and the only thing keeping me from doing it is that I don't want to hurt anyone. I feel so alone and I don't want to sound shallow but I if it's driving me to this than I might as well just let it out...I feel like the ugliest person in the world. I don't think something like this would hurt so much but it does..and I can't help but wonder that if I'd always felt this way I would know how to cope better. I didn't always used to look like this...and now I look at myself and wonder how my appearance changed so much. I feel so much guilt over this but I used to have friends and now I only have one friend and I think the only reason she still remains close to me is because she feels bad for me (I was also gone to a treatment center out of state for 2 years) and so I feel like she thinks shes owes it to me to be kind to me. I just feel so different from everyone and I have scars from cutting and I'm so disproportioned .. and I've become so isolated because I dont wan't people to see me. i stay inside all the time. And now I feel like I want to kill myself to stop the pain but I don't have courage..
2191,I'm scared... I'm nearing my breaking point.,"-- Six months ago, my relationship with my girlfriend hit a rough spot. I tried desperately to work through and make it better, but I didn't get any help."
2192,Holiday Alone,I don't want to live. I'll be spending Thanksgiving all alone...my family suddenly rearranged things about the plans to accommodate another family member and they didn't fit with my schedule but did they care? No...they haven't seen me in year but it doesn't matter to them. They accommodate things for certain family members but I'm expendable to them.
2193,I need advice,Five years ago when I was 15 I went on holiday with my friend and I was raped. This in its self was traumatic for me. To then discover I was pregnant. Of course I had to tell my parents who made me have a abortion. Not the operation the pill abortion. Which is totally barbaric and painful. I failed most of my exams because of this. My friend who i went on holiday with didnt support me and got all my other friends to turn against me. I had no one. My Mother never spoke about it to me and I left college when I was seventeen and got a job. I met my boyfriend when I was 15 who i am still with now. My life has been hell for the last five years of my life. me and my boyfriend are getting married next year and we have just bought a house. I have recently found out that my boyfriend has a gambling problem and has been blowing all of our money while we are trying to renovate our house. I can no longer cope! I want to move away and make a fresh start but he wont. I want to move to the ststes or whatever but he doesnt want to so we cant. he never talks to me about this and if we do he usually ends up arguing with me. I have just got a new job as a assistant manager and my new manager hates me for no reason. Everything bad always happens to me. I cannot see a light at the end of this tunnel. I am so unhappy I just want to die. I cannot cope anylonger. The guilt kills me everyday. I hate myself.
2195,Not pleased with myself so I want to just separate from this world,"People suck. I can't live with all this selfishness and unconsideration. I can't find friends because groups are against each other, and I want to be cool with everyone. I cant just choose one. I can't find anyone that I can relate to. I'm just too damn unique."
2197,What The Hell Is The Point?,"What the hell is the point in living, when you have nothing to live for?"
2198,My Friend,"In April of last year he tried committing suicide by cutting himself. He was sent to the hospital for mental health problems. He was released a month later and told not to smoke weed or drink. He started drinking and smoking weed. I felt like I should stop him since maybe this was making him depressed, but he was happy doing this, so no one said anything."
2199,horrible depressing day,"i woke up this morning feeling horrible. it has been such a long day as i have been stuck inside all the time. i can't drive and i'm stuck here in the wheelchair. i was so bored this afternoon i cried, and ended up surfing the net for porn and suicide websites. i was really thinking about it seriously, taking notes etc. i don't hate life, just MY useless failure of a life."
2200,hope running out,I guess I should have said in the topic hope has long since past...
2201,Suicidal ex boyfriend,"I broke up with my boyfriend about 2 weeks ago because things just weren't working and I stopped loving him. I have been staying in contact with him though because he is very suicidal and I am the only person he has to talk about it with. I encourage him to go to therapy and try to help him through it. He says that I really do help him, and I am currently in school to become a psych nurse so I have a general idea of how to help. However he is still very in love with my and he has gotten much worse since i broke up with him."
2202,5 years today...this is for those contemplating,"5 Years ago today, my sister committed suicide. She had a husband who did not treat her well (verbal abuse) and two beautiful children. She shot herself in the head in front of her husband. He has never been the same. He lost the children to the state because he felt responsible, and started going crazy."
2203,Lethal Dose?help quick please!,"whats the lethal dose of tylenol, tylenol 3, and advil mixed? please help quickly i made a bad mistake..."
2204,Feeling pretty crappy.,So. Usually all my threads in this place end up being deleted because I get mad at certain people for certain remarks that make me feel overwhelmed and darn right pissed off.
2205,An open call.,"I guess we all need help from time to time. I'm 24, good health. For years I have wanted to voyage on oblivion. I have yet to act for what reasons befuddle me. For the most part I don't know how I feel. I don't really feel sad, or happy. I have tried just about every occupation there is and have been successful at each one. Everyone believes I have potential. But I see any job or anything I do in the long term meaningless. Not to say that what I have done is not important to the grand scheme, it's just that I feel that if not me then someone else. Sometimes people annoy me and I feel as if I could simply end their life. End everything that they could ever become. This can even be a person I know well such as a friend. But do I care, no. I don't even think I would feel anything after the deed. Even if I stood at their funeral with their family and friends watching. I have never acted on this impulse because it is selfish. Also I am sure that I would get caught as well. I have had good friends enter and leave my life. I had a best friend that recently disappeared. I don't even think of him unless an inconvenience of his leaving pops up."
2206,The Samaritans,"Hi guys, there are too many posts here to answer back individually as I have only one answer for you all. I had all these thoughts as you do before and I started talking to the Samaritans I emailed them as I wasnt able to say out loud my emotions and fears etc. They really helped me out and because of them I am still here and enjoying my life so much. You never know what is around the corner. This time last year I was stuck in a rut and severly depressed, about to marry someone I didnt love also didnt help. Now 12 months later I am engaged to a wonderful man and had I done anything I would never have found that happiness and never knew it existed."
2207,going through what happened a year ago..,so here's the deal;
2208,I found u to late,i have plans to end it all today i dont see a light ive been looking so hard in the hope that a glimmer may appear but its black i dont want to inlict my miserable life on others anymore i hope ive hae covered all options and that this last act will be peace the peace i strive to gain no more confusion guilt pain thoughts that have become unmanageable i havent been here long but some of u have gone out of your way to help and thank you for that i do appreciate the efforts made and i tried to take on board the advice given its perhaps just been to late for me. The site is a gret support and network for those with many issues its a comendable thing u all do i wish i had been as brave
2209,Short sided.,"I dont want anyone to think I havent thought about doing it. I have. I'm am very ashamed that I let things get this far. I'm 21 years old and I know I have my entire life ahead of me. But to me it doesnt seem that great of a thing to look forward to. I just got out of a four year relationship with the girl of my dreams. She left me because...I still dont know. I did everything. I put her as my number one priority for the whole time. We had a great relationship and till the day it ended I never saw this coming. I still love her very much. I dont eat like I used to. My friends...the ones I have left say I'm not the same person anymore. I want them to know its not my fault. I dont think its working. I have nothing going for myself and I cant go a single minute without thinking about her. I hate to say it but she was my life. Now my life is gone. The pain is unbearable. I just want to be happy. Its been a few months and I'm still not. She seems to be extremely happy. I really just dont want to be here anymore. I really hate what I have become. Everyone I talk to about it seems to shift me aside saying it will be ok. Not really listening at all. I think things would just be easier for the people around me if I let this all go and wasnt here anymore. I really can honestly say that I cant live without her...I mean look at what this whole situation has done to me. I dont feel anything anymore. Love, Hate, Happy, Sad. I just wander around aimlessly and everyone sees it."
2210,well. its happening,"im slowing drifting. i just took the 50 pills along with alot of alchol, im feeling very weird. its working... dont feel sorry for me. i'll be at peace soon"
2212,"Can bear my life, how much more pain can i take",I'm just about at the end of my tether. I'm 38 and alone again afer putting my trust in a man I thought cared for me deeply. Once again it doesn't work out and he has gone. Friends say he lives life as if I never existed after only a month which hurts me terribly as it seems that nothing between us meant anything.
2213,thinking of ending my life,"Hi I've been thinking of ending my life for a while now, I've kept this to myself because I've never been able to end my life because of the people that care about me, so now I've been trying to come up with ways that will make it look accidental, I will never make it look like I planned too do It."

I have w/e a normal person would want in his/her life. Loving family, great friends but I hate myself because I think I don't deserve. Im in first year engineering and there's a lot of pressure on me but since somehow I always got away with gettin high marks in all my courses all these times without working hard.

2233,Thought About It?,I'm sure everyone here has thought about suicide once in their lives. Anyone? And maybe even acted on it.
2234,thank u sometimes we need to accept we lost the battle,thanks to those that were kind enough to answer my posts but perhaps sometimes u have to face that its over for u and that the deep dark feelings are there no matter how much u try to do things to make that change to make them go away
2235,I'm a FAILURE!!!,"I just got my AS results back and i tanked! I really wanted to do medicine but with my results i have no chance, all i have ever wanted to do is become a doctor, that's seriously it! I've been lying in my bed for over 4 hours now just, i don't know. i can't think properly, i don't know how I'm feeling. i know it sounds selfish but i don't care about anything anymore. my mums going round avoiding all calls from family and friends so she doesn't have to tell them I'm a failure. the worst thing is i know none of them would be horrible about it, they'd be like ""awh, she really deserved it"" but that's thing i obviously didn't because here i am wishing i was dead."
2236,A Logical Discussion about it.,"Hi, I would like to ask something, and would like to see what people think about this."
2239,=) I think,"I feel so empty... Like nothing really mattered anymore, at least nothing here on earth. I can't help but feel like I am ready to soar high into the sky and just be free. I'm constantly at gaze into the horizon, thinking how it would actually feel like if Im floating, and leave all my problems, dejection, and desolation behind..."

2250,"When suicide is like an ""old"" friend","Does anyone here ever feel like they ""know"" they will one day kill themselves? Maybe things are not bad right now, but you've known most of your life that you'll eventually end your life. You've fantasized and even planned your suicide countless times. When we moved to a new location I sort of took note (to myself) of places in the countryside where I could possibly blow my brains out should the time come."
2251,I know this is probably the wrong place.,"I can't seem to find a purpose or a path. I can't seem to find a way to escape this feeling that I am living a pointless and sad existence. I can honestly say the only thing keeping me from killing myself is the fact that it would leave my parents with a mess to clean up as far as bills and burial go they barely have enough money as it is. I think about it every day, but I love my parents so much I could never do that them....but something inside me hurts so much that living my life this way forever is more torturous than the pain I know I would cause them. I'm not a lonely person, I have my family. I have long distance friends, they have all moved away and started new lives, we rarely talk anymore. But me....I am so afraid to live my life I would rather end it than hope it gets better. I just needed to write it so that one person could know. It's the hardest life to live. I just feel empty inside, that my life is so routine and so hard to get through everyday. I have no interest in the things I used to love no passion for anything. And I question how God could allow someone to hurt so much and not help them. I could ask for help until I am blue in the face but he will still be far away and unmoving. I know what people will think but pills and professional help are the last thing I need, they never helped before, only made me feel sick. But why can't one person tell me why my life is meaningless and pathetic when everyone else is so full? Why do I have to go to movies and dinner alone while others have significant others and best friends to talk to? Why does my life always end up so lonely?"
2252,hour by hour,"these thoughts will just not ease for me thistime im clock watching nd thinking thats another hour i stayed alive another hour can i get through the next hour ?? shall i get into my car i have a plan shall i go shall i stop ding this placing all these toughts on thius site whe people here are struggling and need support shall i carry this out and end this torment for everybody, then i think of some of the replies ive had and i think no try another hour people have been kind enogh to offer support don ignore that another hour goes by and it is back to the plan how am i going to get through this its never been this bad the feelings of sui...cide never so intense my irrational thoughts so much more powerful than my rational ones im oosing the ability to fight the feelings im loosing this fight for life and seeking the path to heaven if there is a heaven even who knows thanks to all those that took the time to respond to my posts ty"
2253,i wish i could kill myself,"for 4yrs i've been battling with my weight. It has ALWAYS been '1 step forwards, and 2 steps back.'"
2254,How many is enough?,"I'm sitting here with a pill cocktail on the bed next to me, and I want to know how many is enough to kill me. I can't do this anymore. I have no one to turn to, every one hates me and they should, and no i'm not exaggerating. I just want it to be quick. I want to fill myself with the pills and go to sleep forever. I don't even care if I wind up in hell because hell is a lot better than this place."
2255,Finding the strength not to do it.,I took myself to a bad place last night.
2256,"I hope this helps some of you feeling down in the dumps, and/or suicidal...","I do NOT take credit for this, I found this and I just thought it'd help..."
2257,what seems to be wrong with me...hmm..,"I've been of late, lost in deep thought since I have found the time and realized... theres nothing really to live for in my life... I just completed high school and I've moved onto a local community college, I just got hired so i have a small job to give me some extra money, and I've yet to find anything worth living for... many times I've thought of suicide, usually when i circle my thoughts around things dealing with life. I would like to have a girlfriend, but i know I'll never have another one, born alone and destined to die alone, so true it is. But other than petty things like being alone i don't understand so much and it leaves me feeling like everything is pointless. I look at things like choice.. it's just so messed up what a cruel illusion it is, there is no choice it's just a form of control, every major decision is so rigged it isn't even funny, it's like a path through the woods where at the splits, the path continues and all other ways drop off into a chasm. Society is another i don't understand, it strives so hard to tell every one, be yourself, do what you want to do, express who you are, but then when you do, it ousts you, turns its back and labels you or shoves you in the dark like your some kind of fungus or mold, it's just a hypocritical paradox... it's these small things like this i think of, that just leave me guessing, and give me the impression that I never, was, am, or will be in control of my own life. Whats the point of ""living"" if I'm only playing to the beat of someone else's drum and never my own? I dunno much any more, nothing really makes sense to why it's done or why it's that way... i think i broke my reality of subtle spoon fed innocence and ignorance. I'd just really like get shot right in the head.... and make things so much more uncomplicated..."
2258,I have a friend online who wants to kill herself,I have a online friend who wants to kill herself on Sept 24. I think she is serious this time.... I don't know what to do. I only have her cell number and email address. I have never met her
2259,I wrote a suicide note last night,I try to write in a journal that I've kept for 5 years of my life every once and awhile. Usually I just write down thoughts about my day and how I'm feeling. Last night I just felt at my wits end and tired of it all. I wrote a suicide note about everything that's going on and personal letters to all my loved ones.
2260,My boyfriend tried to kill himself,I wrote this is my other thread in the Relationship section but I really need fast advice on this because I really want to go and see him but he's asked me not to. He's in the hospital. His flatmate found him lying on the bathroom floor at 2am last night and when he couldn't wake him up he phoned for an ambulance. My boyfriend drank himself unconscious and the blood test showed he took an overdose of painkillers too. His friend says that my boyfriend made him promise not to call me until this morning and that he doesn't want me to go to the hospital to see him since he's being let out later today after more blood tests. He is refusing to answer any questions about it and even refusing to acknowledge what he did. I know he said I shouldn't go to the hospital but I want to see him. I can't believe this has happened. I am so upset right now. Should I go to the hospital anyway? I'm just sitting here worrying and crying.
2262,,"I'm a complete loser. I have no friends other than a few people I've met over the internet playing games. They think I'm fun to play with, but they don't know how I look like. I've known one of them for 4 years now and she still doesn't know how I look like. I think I am ugly, and even uglier in a photo."
2263,Think I'm having a nervous breakdown.,"i've been having a really rough time with things the last several months. i've been on here before talking about killing myself. i've been a cutter for over a year, though i havent done it in 2 months. I want to. I tried to hang myself a few days ago but couldnt do it. It scared me.Because it was so peaceful and felt like i was just drifting off to sleep.But I thought of my 18 month old son and how my suicide wouldnt stop my pain, it would just transfer to him and he would have problems with his dad killing himself and wondering if it was his fault etc.i cant do that to him. i've been in therapy for a year. i tried to jump off a building once and my friends had to restrain me. my therapist tried to have me check myself into a psychiatric hospital but i didnt want to go so i told her what she wanted to hear, that i was fine, even though it wasnt true. i've been on lexapro for a year. i was up to 40 mg and i felt it wasnt working. so i stopped taking it in june. since then i have crashed and i feel like my whole world is collapsing around me. i dont have the desire to get out of bed and do anything. and if i do i get really hyper for a while and i'm fun then i get anxiety ridden and have panic attacks etc."
2264,Nembutal,"For those of you that find even a minute reason to not give up, hang on to it. As for me, there HAS to be someone out there who can help me find a way to get some nembutal / pentobarbital or at least seconal in Australia???"
2265,I'm going to kill myself...,"I just feel entirely too complicated, and some messages and chats tonight made that entirely clear. I want to thank everyone for their chats, and kind words over the years that I've been here. I'm not going to write a 'goodbye' speech of sorts... I will probably write a final note to my parents tonight, and sister. I just feel that my future is not worth living at this point in my life, and I don't really see a happy ending."
2266,"I don't want to kill myself, but I'm so lonely it hurts like hell.",Have you ever felt this way? No one to share your life with and it rips you up inside? Harder to get out of bed and harder to go to work. I force myself to the gym so I don't end up staying home all day.
2267,"Hey, I'm new here. :(","Just thought I'd introduce myself first I guess ... My names's Lauren, and I'm 16."
2268,My daughter,"Is the only thing stopping me from buying a large bottle booze, and popping every pill I can take tonight."
2269,Who to turn to...,My housemate called last night and said she'd taken an overdose. My other housemate and I went out and found her and brought her home and she told us so many different stories that I don't really know what went on last night apart from the fact that she is clearly very depressed and needs help. I know she won't want to see her GP or talk to her family so don't really know what to do to help her. She's said it will defnitely happen again but she won't let us help her get professional help. I don't know what to do.
2270,Help.. maybe..,"I don't honestly know why I'm writing this, doesn't seem much point anymore... but maybe words can help."
2271,What is going on with me? :(,"I am so afraid right now. I'm just feeling so messed up..Yesterday i wasnt so bad, but tonight, i feel like hurting myself. This isnt the first time i feel like this, but i usually dont want to talk about it, or write about it. I'm really scared. I have so much self-hatred at times, it's so overwhelming. It's not that anything happened today that made me feel this way, or any other day really...it's just what goes on in my head. I just feel like everything is pointless.. and i dont even know why. I'd give anything to not feel like this, but i'm just always angry with myself about everything little thing that i do. Nothing seems right. I just feel like punishing myself all the time now."
2272,Suicidal thoughts,"I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't think I could ever really kill myself or anything, I don't even really want to die. I want to live and enjoy life and enjoy the sun shine when I can, but I often get thoughts of ""I wish I where dead"" running through my head. If I'm driving, I'll just have this....urge to let go of the wheel and hit the gas. Or if I'm walking next to a busy road I think ""Just one step, it only takes one step""."
2273,Hoping for Irredeemable Failure,"Has anyone else ever felt that they've consiously or unconsciously hoped for some sort of irredeemable failure? Afterall, if success becomes obviously and objectively impossible, can you imagine the feeling of complete liberation from obligations, from routine, from effort, and from struggling. How tempting is giving up in the worst of times? What causes you to fight on is the realization that the battle can be won or what a waste of time it was fighting all those battles before only to give up now, when you're closer to your goals or dreams. A massive all-encompassing failure would cut the strings that drag you along. In this case, giving up would actually be rational. If you have no one, if everything you own was stolen, and your reputation so tarnished that no one would ever think fondly of you - regardless of whether you died an old man in your bed or five minutes from now. If you define happiness in such a way that you can never have it, then what then?"
2274,I'm Going to Do It Soon,"There is no reason for me to live anymore. I am 150 lbs overweight and can't stop eating because thats the only pleasure I can get. I'm crippled by shyness, I haven't left the house in a month now. I have insomnia, thats why I am up right now just thinking of my misery. I have no friends at all in this entire world, not one. I had one but she has severe mental problems herself and a few days ago she suddenly turned on me and says she hates me and hopes I die. All I can think of is her cruel words, she says she's going to kill me or get someone else to do it and I hope she does. She keeps harassing me online and I can't get rid of her, I've tried. She knows where I live and my phone number so she will just keep on like that forever, I know. I will never have another friend because I can't ever trust anyone. Besides that, I am almost 20 and still live at home, I am so shy and scared I can't get a job, I am too scared to even answer the phone much less work somewhere. I can't drive anyway for the same reason. Getting any employment will be hard otherwise because I have learning disabilities and ADD. I've never been in a relationship and I know if I go on I will die alone, I have no idea how to make friends or talk to people. I don't understand what people are feeling or thinking and I say things that are wrong and don't know why unless someone explains it to me. My family isn't supportive, my mom works so much she is never there to talk to, she is the only family I really have, I haven't seen my dad since I was a kid. I have a brother who is always mean to me, that is normal with siblings I guess but he is 17 and old enough to know I can't take him calling me fat and ugly all the time. My mom is at work now, I am all alone until 9 am and I can't sleep, I cut myself some today but nowhere that anyone can see. I want to do it some more but I want to stop also, I have been crying all day and my head hurts, I am exhausted and I can't sleep. I'm on Lexapro and Klonopin but they don't help me very much, I have been on many medicines and nothing ever helped, I was in counseling for years but that didn't help either so I stopped going. I don't know what to do, I don't know where to go for help, I have also been in hospitals and clinics but all they do is change my medicine and I am so stressed and panic there because I can not be away from home for more than a few hours. I cannot go in a store even by myself and I have to walk close to someone always, anywhere I go. I look bad and I can't afford new clothes, I don't know anything about hair or makeup to look better. Anyway I have a skin problem that causes brown discoloration all over my body so I am ugly no matter what and I have bad scars from surgery I had a few years ago. My life is just so bad and I can't find any reason to live now. There is no hope, I don't know what to do. I've been researching ways to kill myself and have a note ready, I think I will do it soon. Something inside wants to be talked out of it but I really don't know if I can. I just don't have any future wheter I live or not."
2275,"help, i am anorexic, somewhat recently friendless, want to die","being down is even worse once you've been up. Im anorexic. It will never leave me not matter what i do, i will always hate myself. i have no friends i am in high school and spend my days alone watching while others enjoy eachothers company during the wasted best years of my life, companionship is a human need that i envy in people. i used to have friends but now i have none, and i sure as hell never had and never will have a lifelong friend to help me through hard times. I have nobody to talk to, if i told this to anyone i know i would only be pushed away even more. I want to die but im so afraid and i want help from anybody please help me overcome my fear of death so i dont have to live with the constant dread of waking up to the same nothingness that is my life."
2276,my life is a void,"i want to talk to some one about this, but i dont want to talk to some one about this. i guess i am afraid of rejection. i am always afraid of rejection, that is how i have always been, ive always been a coward."
2277,Welcome to reality..(what can I do?),"There was a time,my friends when I believed that life is alike stories..that after every defeat comes a victory,after every bad time,times of great happiness..just like after the clouds pass comes the sun.In that times,I dreamed..and I believed that dreams can come true..but they never did..I loved someone,and I believed that real love can cross every border and bring people together..I believed that there is a destiny for each person and that eventually everything turns good..Now,I wish I can still believe such science fiction stories about happiness,and goodness of people..I was used,exploited by others just because I couldn't say a single word comes to me,even if I have friends,they never come to me,never call me with them.At school,people come to me only to ask me to help with their homework(they take good marks,better than me)..many people don't even say ,,hello'' to me...I live with my family...but I isolated in my room,in front of PC,where I live most of my life..Some say I'm shy,while others say I'm arrogant,that I try to seem superior(I don't wish that)..so I m confused...maybe I complain too much..but I feel so marginalized..so rejected So,if dreams never come true,should I stop dreaming?..If I wish that impossible thing,to be like all other teens I see(I don;t wish to drink or to have sex,just to socialize more,have some real friends) and I know it will never be this way,which way to take.I can't be someone else,I can't pretend or imitate behaviours,I m not good and people hate fakers.But I will resist,I will live my life until the good Lord will decide to take me away,because to be honest,I only have one question troubling me does it worth living for?"
2278,Life as a Game of Monopoly,"When was the last time you played a game of Monopoly, actually setting up the board, organizing the properties, and handing out the money? The games often lasted hours until someone or everyone finally stood up with frustration and quit. So often, it gets to the point where two people control the whole board and each ends up paying out and taking in the exact same stack of money, over and over again. While you’re playing you think about how much more fun this game used to be when you were younger and it was new. As soon as you’ve gone around the same board so many times, routinely fought for the same valuable spaces, and paid the fines or received the financials windfalls again and again, the game just loses all its attraction and meaning. When your pride or ambition keeps you playing for hours with the knowledge that you’ll probably never win, sometimes you just hope that you’ll land on all your adversary’s worst spaces. If this happens, you didn’t lose due to lack of skill or perseverance but rather simply because of random chance - and it's not your fault. While you’re there at that table, you must move around in an endless and repetitive circle. You hope for that quick end so that you can move on with you life or back to a place where hard work, intelligence, and the best intentions can change your life and those of the people around you for the better."
2279,help!,"I don't know what to do, I just feel like killing myself..i cant stop crying! I lie here on the ground with the cord around my neck pulling it tighter, just screaming for it to all stop! I've wrote a goodbye note to everyone...i just cant deal with his pain anymore! I'm dead inside!"
2280,My friend killed himself last night,"I'm in shock. Why would he do this? Last night he hung himself from a backyard fence at his mom's house. He had a puppy, a beautiful lab named Junior. He loved Junior so much. He always asked my brother and I to come visit them. He was like another brother to me."
2281,Suicide with a point,"Say somebody suffered from massive depressions, had an uncurable STD, was littered with mental diseases such as OCD among others, ritual after ritual day in and day out for their entire life, some even causing severe bodily harm, and now they recently discovered they might have emphysema at age 21 due to the amount of smoking they have done over the past 6 years, because smoking was one of the few things that brought them joy and took the edge off at times, this person happens to be extremely intelligent, and isin't thinking about ending it all because ""the world is cruel"", or ""nobody cares"", blah blah blah, but simply because they are smart enough to understand that it is impossible for them to live a normal, healthy, happy life, and considering age 21...that would be a long life of complete misery ahead, so what if they took into realization that death would be much more peaceful then the life they have to look ahead at, and the only single thing halting it is the fear of hell?"
2282,A place to write...,I have been suffering inside my own head for a while now and am glad to finally have found somewhere I can write about what is going on with me.... well... the best I can.
2283,i'm back,sorry i ain't been on its just alot has happened to me.
2284,this world disgusts me,I hate it when people say its selfish to want to die! so its better to stay alive and pretend to be happy?
2286,Felt like typing this...,I typed this up right now.
2287,101 reasons to live,"I want to make this list, and I want you guys to help me."
2288,Help!,Help please please
2290,Greatest looser,"I dont even know why i am posting this..I'm going to end my life.I'm a medical student, from india.I've been suffering from depression for the last two years and was under treatment.But treatment never helped me.Things are getting more and more worse than ever.I've never passed an examination all these two years.I am not able to do anything properly.It seems i have no control over myself.It now hurts me a lot when i think of my good old days.I once was a happy and hard working boy and had a lot of friends.For all these two years i hoped i would get better but it never happened.It pains a lot when all others treat me as a mental patient.Oh my god i cant take it any more.It seems a life like this is not worth living.I'm ending this miserable life.I have given myself six more hours to live,for i want to enjoy some minutes without the anxiety about tomorrow.I'm posting this because i want to express my feelings to someone before my death.Good bye all.I'm sorry for my poor english."
2291,"Goodbye, ENAers","It's been nice knowing all of you. Thank you for trying to help me with my problems, but I'm too far gone. I'm too sick and too pathetic to live; I'm hitting myself harder than I've ever done, so I know I'm gonna commit suicide too."
2292,friend's suicide,"A very close friend of mine shot himself recently. I want to go back in time and tell him that there is a beast living in him that only he can control, and if he kills himself he will unleash this beast onto those he loves and those who love him. It will eat them up and draw them into the hell he lives in."
2293,Confused and suicidal,"right now, i'm having a rather cranky relationship, and just moments ago, my girlfriend shut me off, and i don't know what i've done wrong that she's so mad about. i tried calling her a couple of times, but no answer and right now, i've been skipping my anti-depressants cause i feel like jumping over a 20-story building or just stabbing myself to death. i just can't live life without her. i can go through anything as long as she's by my side, and that worked out fine with my time with her, even though she's giving me such a pain in the butt, but i don't mind, i take her as she is, though i don't know how long i'll last."
2294,"Seriousness of a ""threat""",Should a threat of suicide always be taken seriously? Or are there times when you can tell they don't mean it and might be saying it for effect to get a reaction? Any red flags that can be noticed?
2295,I think about suicide daily,I've hit such a low point in my life. Everything feels so hopeless. I just haven't felt like my self for so long now.
2296,Anti-depressants,Is there anyway to get hold of them without seeing a doctor? And do they actually work?
2297,School makes me want to die,"Hmm, well, this is kind of awkward for a first post but this issue is really becoming unbearable and I would appreciate some feedback."
2300,Lost,"I can’t find the door to exit my irrational mind; it is so dark so cold and lonely inside, I use to be afraid now I just hurt. I am so and very very tired. I opened a window to try and find some help, some light but the wall kept them away I could hear them encouraging me to keep looking to not give up, so I obliged but I kept running into the walls until I bled inside out."
2301,Need an outside perspective,"I have been listening to a lot of Seether, mainly Karma and Effect and Disclaimer II albums, and when I listen to most of the songs it makes me feel like crap, but it gives me some kind of energy, so I tend to listen for the energy. Well lately the more I listen to them the more it makes me feel like I could harm myself especially since a lot of stress and problems in my life make me feel bad on a daily basis."
2302,45 Year Old Friend Is Suicidal..It's REAL!,"To all of you who have been there; who are there, hanging on the thoughts of suicide, I need your help. Maybe by helping others to see your side, it could help you and my friend together."
2303,really want to die,"i've been diagnosed with severe major depressive disorder and ptsd. it seems like friends/boyfriends make plans with me and then make plans with others after making plans with me and i get cancelled on, but they keep thier plans with others. i feel really nonexistant to the world so i feel like not exisiting at all. i'm not important to anyone, never have been and never will be so i know no one will truly care whether or not i'm dead."
2304,Life Is Tough For Everyone.,"I'm just so sick of trying. I have no friends. My life up until this point has been a complete waste. I'm sick of being alone. I hate this all of this loneliness damn it ehy cna't i just , .......i'm so lonely. I'm seventeen years old and I still feel depressed all the time. I don't have any friends. The few people that are nice enough to say hi to me when I see them I just freeze up around them and don't know what to say. It's so hard to see everyone else around you so happy and carefree and I wish I could just be like them but I can't because in the back of my mind I know I will never get those years back. I'll never be given the opportunity to be friendlier, to be more outgoing. It's gone forever. I've spent my entire life alone in my room. I wish I had someone to talk to. I wish I wasn't an only child and I hate living so <> far away from everyone I know because then I could go and do all those things that I should have been doing all this time. I don't have a car, and there's no way to get one because my parents would never let me buy one. i can't talk to my parents. all my dad does all day is come home and tune out watching that <> tv all night fighting with my mom about money. all my mom ever does is yell at me or my dad. she's the only one i've ever talked to about anything but if i told her how depressed i always am should would just get mad and think that i was an ungrateful son after all of the sacrifices they've made for me. i hate all of this, life is so empty. i can't just sit around the house anymore i need to talk to other people but i can never go anywhere and there'd might as well be no one here with my parents the way they are. it's sad that this is the only place i can say these things but i just can't hold it in anymore. i've thought about killing myself so many times but i'm too afraid to do it. i'm thinking maybe tomorrow when i drop my mom off at work i'm just going to skip work and take her car all the way back home and just sit there with the garage closed. i think that's the only peaceful, painless way to go because it's like going to sleep. if this is what things are going to be like until i go to college i can't wait another year. besides, things won't ever change it's too late for me i'll never be normal . you don't know what it's like to sit alone day in day out, the only people you ever see are your parents. you can't go anywhere because you don't have a car, and whenever you ask to borrow one of your parents cars they wont let you because hey wont pay for the gas and you have no money because your parents wont let you spend any and everyone you know lives an hour away. no one ever calls...............and when i call they're never there. the loneliness just never goes away...."
2305,Bullet to the brain 22nd birthday.,"I hate my life. I want to die. I am thinking of killing myself on my 22nd birthday, but I know I wont do it b/c every year this is my plan. For some reason I hang on. I have this hope that maybe things will get better. Nothing is really wrong w/ my life (well nothing awful) but I am sooo depressed anyway. I dont know why. I have a great bf but I want more. Im doing well in school but it bores the hell out of me and I want to leave. I have very few friends and its so hard to make new ones or more friends. I just want to not eat for like a month. I keep thinking not eating will make me feel better."
2306,I wrote this about my death/long ago.,"I wrote this a long time ago, what do you all think?"
2307,brother in law wants to kill himself over a girl!,"My 40 year old (yes, 40!) brother in law recently started dating a 22 year old whom he got pregnant after about 6 months of dating. She had wanted children, a family with him, she purposely went off the pill and all."
2308,It does not matter,time to go
2309,It just all messed up!! ALWAYS.,"Ok guys, i'm just really tired of doing this on my own. And i really need some help. Because i'm starting to think about suicide again, at the moment i definitely don't plan on it, but i can't believe i'm thinking about it AGAIN."
2312,Suicide tips?,"What is an effective, painless, clean way to kill oneself?"
2313,Please help me!,"So here I am on the suicide forum. I used to have the last card in my pocket of ""I wouldn't actually do. More like I just wanted God to take me."" But now, I want to. I really really do. I am so lonely and isolated, and I don't know how to break out of that. I have no friends, and I have no idea how to make them. I keep repeating the same patters in my love life, and the more it happens, the stupidier I feel because I should have known better. Im just lost. I've been crying uncontrollably for the past hour, and I just don't know what to do."
2314,therapy sessions coming to an end. what now?,"i have 1 session left, 1 hr. i have been seeing the same person for over a year but there is a finite amount of time obviously. it started after my last involvement with suicidal thinking, and i haven't done any since. but i recently lost my job for being rubbish and i have nothing to fall back on. i won't even have my 2weekly appointments to look fwd to now."
2315,what to do?,i guess loss can sum up the reason for me being upset for long. i am 16. my name is charlie. i am on this website to ask for some advice.
2316,thoughts about suicide,"OK so lately i have been really stressed out, my best friends dad died of cancer 2weeks ago, he was like a seound father to me, my Girlfriend for almost 3yrs broke up with me, my other best friends grandmother is dieing cuz of cancer, i have been really stressed out, i have had deep thoughts of suicide, i have had everything planed out and everything, but i really dont wanna die it just seam like an easy way out of all this stress and depresstion, on top of everythihng else i have to move out of the house that i have lived in for almost 6yrs. any idea on how to stop the suicide thoughts, how to deal with all this stress."
2317,Wishing you were never born........along the lines of being suicidal?,"I have a friend who thinks just like me. We both wish we were never born. However we don't want to kill ourselves but hate the hardships life offers you, seeing our loved ones grow old and die, and knowing we will age and not be able to take of ourselves."
2320,won't be here,I'm defo falling over the edge now i've found out some shocking news on another website and i defo want to go now
2321,Please dont.,"I see a lot of posts about suicide and how lonely life is. I am here to say please don't. You don't realize the pain and agony it causes someone. I know life is hard and very depressing and that taking your life may be your only way out - but please be strong. I understand that for most of you that are thinking about suicide, you feel as this is your last and only option. It really isn't!!"
2322,My little sister attempted suicide today.,"My sister has dyslexia, it has been the cause of depression for her for as long as I can remember. She has overcome many issues stemming from it. From actual reading issues, to social issues and being 'different.'"
2323,no big loss,I want to go away vanish anything.... I just want to be gone sick of my parents and everything that's happened.
2324,it gets worse,"what the hell do i gota do to be happy, im getting friends and, idk about a gf. i dont even know what i want."
2325,is it worth it,I feel like i am not going to make it to my next birthday which is just over 4 months away it will either be my doing or by accident but most likely by my hand.
2326,Is he just after attention?,So I got a weird phone call from the ex today. It lasted for maybe 30 seconds. It went something like this:
2328,Question about suicidal thoughts and break ups...,"I am just curious as to what you think it says about someone who has suicidal thoughts after breaking up. The reason as I am curious is that my first serious ltr ended a yr ago and we both havent moved on yet but she is dating someone else and has been. for some reason she always comes back into contact with me. then we are fine for a while and then she is distant and I end up depressed again. I know it is my own problem that I allow this but I recently decided I will never speak to her again, as she cheated on me and now has cheated on this new guy so how could I trust her. but anyways lately I have been thinking about suicide. I would never actually kill myself but these thoughts creep into my mind as I am alone a lot. I just wonder is it because I am emotionally weak or just been on an emotional rollercoaster for far too long? I feel bad that I let her do this to me and did not stand up for myself and I know I should have."
2329,confused about suicide,"well for one im severley depressed, taking meds and all of that good stuff but i cant help but wish i was dead every waking second of the day. im not suicidal because i would never acutally kill myself. Im a catholic and view suicide as a ticket to hell and besides, I could never put my family through that kind of emotional trauma. I dont kno what to do maybe i just need to suck it up"
2330,"Hey, I wanna die.","So anyway, for a lot of reasons I listed on another site, I want to die, really, Really badly. My life gets worse and worse every day and I can't seem to break free. My existence is a friendless excuse for wasting space and endless consuming. Such a Dark place I am in. Any advice?"
2332,"I need help, please tell me how?","Oh my God, can someone please help me? My friend took 60 sleeping pills, will he die? He just sent me a message and he's in USA."
2333,She said she wants to kill herself...,"Hi all,"
2334,How soon should you seek help?,"Feeling REALLY down. I am so depressed. Suicide has never creeped into my head until recently. I find myself saying things like, ""If things don't change by so-and-so date, I'm done."" I picture the world without me. Like what impact would it have. And to be honest, I don't see it as a big deal. Of course it would hurt my parents and family but they would get over it. They have their lives and life would go on. I just feel so insignificant. I really have nothing to live for. No girlfriend, no friends, nothing. I feel my efforts at making life better for myself is a complete waste of time. Why keep going to school? So I have a high GPA...so what? Nobody cares. Why keep going to work? So I have my own apartment in an expensive neighborhood and are able to buy expensive stuff. So what? Nobody cares. Why keep going to the gym? I lost weight and achieved a 6 pack. So what? Girls don't care. Why even get out of bed? NOBODY CARES!! Things just aren't changing and I don't see light at the end of the tunnel. I feel so alone. I hate it. I don't want to keep living like this."
2335,Ciprolet pills... what is it?,I just found out that the pills are -ciprolet 500mg each pill. Anyone who is a pharmacist or doctor can tell me what happens if the person takes 60 such pills?
2337,I hate being cliche.,"Senior year is amazing. Senior activities were amazing. Prom is tomorrow and it will be amazing. My girlfriend is amazing, despite our ups and downs. Life is just amazing."
2338,At this point again,I feel pretty foolish posting here again. It seems like I should either get this over with or get it together and stop being such a pain.
2339,No,First of all I hope you would excuse me for my poor english
2340,Surpassed Suicide,"I came to a point in my life where I know I was supposed to be dead. I watched my apartment being cleared of my belongings, lots of people and no one complained. I came to a blankness in life, a nothing. It's nothing I have ever experienced before. It's like having a blank slate only there's no desire to write on the slate. I was truly waiting to die for days on end and wondering why I hadn't. I was in a pretty serious car accident and survived. My life has gone downhill since that point and I still wonder why I survived. I then reached the peak of suicide, several times, and haven't done it."
2341,I'm Done!!!!,I'M DONE....
2342,i'm so so so so upset,this last week ain't went well at all
2343,What a life :'(,Well all problems have kicked off today like my friend telling my tutor about someone who was banned from here and she was concerned also she made me scrap my monolog piece i was acting cos it was too personal it was about dario. So i had to write another one and i learnt that one off by heart now i have to start again. Also family problems have started my sister has been kicked out of school and has ran away
2344,Why can't I forget?,Why can't I forget about suicide? Why can't my life be good for 2 days in a row? It seems that every time something good happens something bad has to happen the next day and just crush everything. And I think it's pointless to keep moving when that's been happening for so long. Bouncing on a rock bottom isn't a way to live.
2345,Nazi,It all started like 3 or 2 years ago. I have now gone mad and I mean mad I
2346,"I want to die: painless, quick and clean","Hi guys I want to die, but I want to do so in a quick clean painfree dignified way. I dont want to become a mess for others to clean up."
2347,I just can't take it...anymore,"I can't take all of this stupid crap from women, from love and relationships. Everyone else has someone, but me. I'm gonna take it into consideraton to erase myself. If I'm going to be alone, I might as well be dead"
2348,17 tomorrow,Even though i think i'm 14 still and people say i look 14 cos i hardly wear make up but....
2349,I've finally reached the point,I posted a novel on another board here and won't repeat it.
2350,Miss her so much,"Hi. I'm new here. I lost my Mom just before Thanksgiving. You'd think by now, I'd be coping with it a little better, but I can't seem to get past it. I feel so fragile emotionally that I find myself in a dark place. I've had thoughts over the years, but the one thing that always stopped me was knowing how much it would hurt Mom. Now I'm gonna have to move, and I've got problems at work. I find myself thinkng about suicide all the time. I'm just hoping that it won't be to hard on my siblings if I lose this fight. I cry - alot. The only escape I have is sleep. I wish I could sleep forever."
2351,I am a survivor of a relatives suicide,My sister in law killed herself on Tuesday night in a very violent way. She had made numerous attempts over the years and this time she did it.
2352,Advice Needed A.S.A.P,"I received a phone call Wednesday night - My brother put himself in hospital by attempting suicide (Pills). He was free to go on Thrsday morning, after telling the Doctors that he ""will do it again""."
2355,When i feel suicidal,i just talk to drew on msn or here and he helps me which i'm grateful for without him i would just take another overdose
2356,I almost did it today,today i took many many pills...i went to sleep and did not expect to wake up. I scared myself. I was in a horrible state of mind. I am at the start of a minimum 2 year seperation - and thats if things work out after that time. Im not looking for attention...just a friend.
2357,My best friend needs help!,"My best friend for a long time needs help and it's getting harder and harder for me to help her. Lately she has been getting suicidal a lot and she only turns to me because she feels I'm the only one who understands her. We both have Asperger's syndome and I'm afraid she might have psychosis like what I have. She has been talking to herself, and just today she said she say images from the future and she wanted to kill herself from what she saw. She is so close to me, I can't stand to see her go through what I have gone through before I was put on medication. She is scared to go on medication. Oh, and she used to love cute things, but now she has become scared of them. It is so hard for me to help her. I know what she is going through, but that alone is not enough. This time I was only just bearly able to help her, I'm not sure if I can next time. I'm so scared of losing her. After all the years we have known each other I still call her Jirachu and I still don't know her real name. She was recently grounded from getting online late at night so now we bearly ever get to talk. I want to be there for her if she ever needs me again. I usualy am so good at helping people. This is so hard for me and now I don't know what to do. I met Jirachu even before I met my first GF, she is my best and closest friend. I can't let her go."
2358,Feel like Jumping,"I'm at the end I think, can't go on feeling like this......"
2359,Angels are calling ....,for me i have to go i'm just sick of life since i was 4 i've had it bad i can't seem to get over the past and everything

2362,goodbye,i have had it..its over...I'M DONE!!!!!!!
2363,i had one last chance but now... no more hope,"well , for the ones who have read my theads finally i got some psicologycal help, i wanted so bad to go to my ex therapist but she said she was too far and she was also busy so she recomended me a friend of hers. Virginia (my ex therapist) was young so i thought her friend would be young as well , and today i went to my first session with her and it really sucked!! she was an old woman who thought she knew everything and she said (or thats what i understood) it was normal and it was just a phase, she really doesnt know how i feel inside and after finishing that session of hell i told my mom that woman was boring and thought she knew all, my mom told me i was there for help not for fun but now instead of getting help im gonna live a hell every monday. i dont want this to happen, i have a sore throaght and im crying so much my eyes are already swollen, i want more than ever to kill myself rite now, but i dont want to let my parents down."
2364,i need help,i was very suicidial at the weekend my friend was worried about me and went off it when i told him i took 6 pills but he doesnt no i took another two also i feel for mmy friend cos her and my sister knew this lad who was 13 and he died choking and she was upset and i was in tears to about it even though i didnt know him

2368,Cruel Asian Society On Depression and much more,Hi
2370,Enough,"I guess since I searched this site out there's some part of me that doesn't want this, doesn't want to die."
2371,My painful ordeal with a ND overdose (May Be Graphic To Some),I'm a very very lucky man to be alive at this point. I had to hear it from the Doctor that I was so close to death that there's no way I would have survived if I hadn't gone to the hospital when I did. Truthfully I never intended on going to the hospital and didn't think it was so bad until I was discovered in the bathroom throwing up so violently that they took it upon themselves to take me to the hospital ASAP.
2372,Pls talk if you're here..,"I'm just feeling so rotten, alone and having all these suicidal thoughts going through my head atm so if you're online and have MSN messenger pls drop me a line."
2373,Too distraught to even explain,"I've been reading the posts here, so I know I'm not alone when I say that one more thing will topple me."
2374,i'm so,depressed want to kill myself hate life my friend said turn emo mean i am need dressing tips anyone emos
2375,should love hurt so much to make me think about dead?,im only 14 years old.
2376,please,i'm soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo wanting to die now its so hard living please read my journel
2377,My dad killed himself,"He hung himself when I was 12 years old. I am 22 now and still not over the pain. I still have not visited his gravesite because for maybe the first 8 years i was not emotionally ready to come to terms with that harsh relaity of it but as time went on I've developed an anger for him. I dont want to visit him simply because he did that to himself and he RUINED my family. I have a younger sister who is 18 now, she is growing up hurting inside imsensley because she feels alone and inadequate in comparison to her friends because her father killed himself. My older sister resorted to drugs and medication and cutting herself, and she is mentally damaged for life because she constantly blames herself. My older brother still calls me crying telling me how he will never feel adequate as a man due to our dad not being around to finish raising him."
2378,i'm hanging over the edge,SOMEOME PLEASE CATCH ME BEFORE I FALL
2380,What do i do?,"I dont even know how i feel anymore all i know is that i dont want to be here anymore, i just want to end this life of mine but i dont want to its just i cant take this anymore my sister is bringing me down way to much, im scared im going to do something stupid, i dont know who i am anymore. What am i spose to do, sister is making me go down cuz she knows i wont turn my back on her. I feel so numb and so angry. I really dont know what to do anymore. So what do i do?"
2382,Just read it before you do anything to yourself.,Suicide is not the answer
2384,i am so tired of this!,"i hate this so much, i hate being alive. it seems that each day i manage to screw up in a completely different way, i wish i could just kill myself so i wouldnt have to feel this pain any more, but i know i cant. it wouldnt be fair to do that to my friends and family, iv already hurt them enough. i gues im just looking for some other escape which doesnt include living, or dying, lol, doesnt really leave much else does it?"
2385,When do you think is it justified in taking one's own life?,"I would believe if one does not fit within society, such as a defect or one with nothing to lose, then they are justified in taking their own life. It is their life, and so it is their choice to decide upon."
2386,i cant hold on to it.,"hey all , im new here, im really sick of my life ive thought of suicide all of this started in 2003 in tae kwon do class, there was this girl Arantxa, i felt something really weird towards her because im a girl too. she became my friend i i was getting into her really much, i dont know what it was but maybe i was in love. there was this other girl Jessica she was our friend too but i knew she hated me, she hanged out with Arantxa more than me , i was really jealous. time happened and i quit tae kwon do. i quit on january 12th 2006. i never spoke to Arantxa again but once in the messenger i said hi to her and she told me- i can see you have no friends- and i replied i have more than you do - and she said maybe theyre dug addicts or lesbians and i didnt spoke to her until yesterday. she was in the dressing rooms and i said hi to her. there was jessica again. i want to kill myself cause im really jealous of people talking to some of my friends what can i do?? i could kill myself of love. im only 14"
2387,Am I trying to kill myself?,I was just looking in retrospect my life so far. I’ve noticed that I might be trying to kill myself and that is happening for almost a year now (seems I’m not very good at it LOL). The thing started when my almost fiancée left me for another guy – it was almost a year ago.
2388,To santa claus and little sisters,To Santa Claus and Little Sisters
2390,hey everyone. this sound good?,"It’s so hard to focus, with these thoughts running through my head. Sometimes I feel as though I'm worthless, and non existent, I have no right to feel this way. People say I’m important to there lives, important for them to stay right. A suffering for myself is to stay living, but I must not go because of fear for those around me. I must feel for their safety. Risking the death of myself, would hurt those close to me. But they will be over it in moments of time. Because I’m just a lost soul who cant finds it way. With a corrupted mind fallowing all the time. The pleasure of life has now been infected with the pain. I cant be still or alone without it coming out to haunt me. I just had wished to rest and sleep this pain away. I just want one thing now, after all this is through, and I am out of sight. I want my soul to be forgotten, and the tears wiped away. I want to be of no existent."
2392,I feel like giving up,"I wrote before how I have had depression on and off for four years, ive been on medication, but recently had a really bad patch of depression and now going to the psychologist once a week."
2393,suicide,does one tablet harm you please help x x
2395,very suicidal,i'm very suicidal atm and tomorrow i'm really scared because i'm going to see a counsellor
2396,Never find someone.,"Anyone else out there afraid they won't find someone to spend/share their lives with? Being ugly, and kinda weird, I don't see myself finding one sadly. This has been the main reason for my depression since I was 13 and the kids at school (and even up to this day at 20) would pick on me for my looks. I also have a strong feeling that this is why I'm so weird and socially inept too. This destroyed my confidence and maybe any chances I might of had in creating any relationships. It really gets me down too when people claim to be far from shallow, when later I would hear them comment on how hot someone was"

2398,Stitches/Depressedone89,The last post Stitches made was this one 166689[/url]
2401,I hate myself and i want to die (c),"Hello everybody,"
2402,In your teens? Why you dyin,I can tell you this from experience:
2403,Question about normality....,I am just curious about something.
2407,I NEED help now someone PLEASE listen!!,I've made my decision and I NEED to do it tomorrow. I've read many
2408,I dont see the point anymore,"Ive had depression and social anxiety for years now, Im just so lonely, I have no friends and find it impossible to get close to people. I feel like I cant handle it anymore. each day is like torture, unable to form close connections with people. I just feel so isolated"
2409,i dont know how to tell my mom...,hey guys!
2410,My story,"Recently split from my girlfriend, we were together 9 months but best friends for 4 years before that. I honestly feel she was my soulmate, we had so much in common i loved spending time with her. Before we hooked up into a relationship i was in the process of moving to a new city about 30 miles from where i used to live. We hooked up about 2 months before i moved. After we had been together for a few months after i moved she wasnt too happy with the situation so i said i would move back once i could find the right house to buy. Last week she told me it was over, i was devastated because as far as i knew everything was going fine. I really didnt get a proper explanation as to why. Due to being with her a lot i didnt get to grips with living in new city and spent a lot of my time back in old town."
2411,i want it all to stop...,"today as i lay in my bed, i began to cry. everything inside me hurt. and i had my first ever thought of suicide."
2414,I don't know what to do,"I don't know what to do anymore. To cut a long story short, last summer I got my first gf, then realised I love my best friend so break up with gf, best friend like me back (even though she's usually straight), then best friend meets boy, goes out with boy, my heart gets broken, I get more and more unhappy, start self harming, go to doctors and get told I'm depressed, meanwhile best friend spends more and more time with bf, I get even more unhappy, we argue more and more."
2415,"Poem about those little things, that could stop you from going","When people have thought about suicide, they often say it was just the little things that held them back. Not much really. Not alone anyway. But when you put them all together like this… POWER! These are the things I know I’d miss the most. And if you’ve never experienced any of the below, well then, you’re in for a treat, should you chose to stick around."
2416,Cnt carry on much more.,"okay where do i start, basically my life is pretty screwed up. My family hate me, they threten to chuck me out, and have told me they hate me and wish i was dead. (this is at 15yr old). since then i have been living a lie, i have always tried to keep a happy face and tell people it dont matter and that i dont need my family, ill make it alone. but truthly this has destoryed most bases of my life, my one last happiness was my gf."
2417,:(,"not doing good at all! for the past 2 weeks i have been having suicidal thoughts! i dont know why though! i go to therapy tomorrow, but is that soon enough!?!?!? needing some support... dont know wht to do .. i want to cut so badly!!"
2419,i so wish,i was dead i so wish i was RIGHT NOW!!! want to take another OD tonight i hate everything.
2420,New and in need of help,"Hello everyone, this is my first time here."
2421,paracetamol,can 50 paracetamol if taken harm you
2422,Friends mum commited suicide - what do you say?,"Hi,"
2423,feel like the whole world is against me..,"Well I was backstabbed by some friends at work. I never knew that people I thought I could talk to and be friendly and sometimes talk my life to would stab me in the back and cost me my job. I was placed on suspension with pay from work but I feel this shouldn't have happened to me. People at work made false allegations agaisnt me that I was not helping them out and that I was listening to music and not doing my job. I was on a lunch break! i can do what I want, but yet they went to Human Resources and file complaints about me. I feel extremely hurt about the backstabbing supposed friends did to me that it makes me see the whole world as one big joke. I feel like whats the point in trying to make new friends or seek new things when there is so much hate, jealousy, backstabbing going on, its really impossible to trust someone in today's world. I feel that if I commit suicide I dont have to deal with this anymore and not have to endure being stabbed like Julius Ceasar or crucified by Jesus by people who are supposed friends. What kind of life can I live after this traumatic experience? I'll always live in fear about trusting people and will end up isolated from the world, this trauma has made me scared of the world and of starting all over in a new job. Why continue living? our life is about MONEY..and thats why we go to school for better job, we try to have this money to have someone to love us by taking them out for movies, etc."
2424,Just a thought...,"First off, I am not even sure if this belongs in this sections but it seemed to fit the best (at least from my perspective)."
2425,Lost and Depressed,I can't believe this is happening to me. I thought everything would be okay but now I'm away from the only person who cares and he has a job where he's treated like dirt and I can't find a job no matter what I do. We're going to be kicked out of the house we're liveing in soon and it's all my falt. I screwed up so much and now the one person I love most is paying for it. Everything is just so bad and I don't know what to do. I cry everynight and I just want it all to end so badly that I'm thinking about slitting my wrists.
2426,No more,
2427,forever lost and alone,"Greetings fellow travels,"
2428,i dont know what to do anymore,im 10 minutes from ending my life i tried to make myself a better but it only made my depression worse. i figured i give it one last chance today and ended up regreting not doing it last night. my aim/aol screen name is Hotbox121505 if anyone cares to talk
2429,Follow your Dreams,"Follow your dreams, do what you truly want to do, or you'll end up depressed like me. Luckily I have caught myself now and I still have time to rectify my error. Basically, I did science at university because I thought I wanted a career with money and I thought it would make my parents happy. They wanted me to become a doctor. I was good enough to get into a science program at a good university, but it didn't make me happy at all. Because I wanted to do philosophy or art."
2430,Dont know what to do anymore,"I really cant believe im writing this, iv tried so hard to act like everything is okay but i just cant anymore. I am just so broken and im dying alil more inside all the time, i feel so broken, i just dont want to be here anymore. I cant take this life its killing me so much. Im cant act like this happy kid much longer and i also cant show how im feeling since i dont wont my mother to worry since she has enough to worry about already plus she has a bad heart i dont want to corse her anymore heart attacks or anything like that."
2431,Laughable situation in a Laughable life,"When I was thirteen, i became extremely depressed. I hid it from my mother until i was sixteen when some stupid girl told the nurse that I was cutting myself. I went to therapy four times and acted fine. I hate therapy. At almost eighteen, my mom found out again i was cutting by looking in my journal (i had hidden it better that time). therapy again, faked it till i went to college and now that i am here, the school therapist told me i was fine. i was on anti-depressants and migraine medications but i took myself off them, i prefer the pain."
2432,How NOT to Disappear Completely,Today is a day I never thought I'd reach. I remember when I was about 5 how I wondered if I would be so lucky to reach 100 years old. I really missed that I thought like that but I had no idea that at 20 this is how much I would value life.
2433,I don't know what to do anymore. (long),"I am so confused and lost at this point and I feel like I have no other options anymore. I think about suicide all the time and I made myself promise that I would wait at least a year, but it is getting harder and harder to do so. Bottom line is, I want love. I want it so badly, and yet I just cannot seem to find it. Instead, I seem to have heartbreak after heartbreak, and I don't know why. I am not a bad person: I'm pretty, funny, fun to be around, I have lots of friends, and lots going for me. I'm not saying this to brag, I'm merely trying to point out that I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. What makes matters worse is that there are plenty of guys who want to go out with me, I do get asked out quite a bit, in fact I tend to get guys who obsess with me and call me all the time, email me all the time, etc, even after I politely tell them I am not interested. It just hurts me because I get ""why on earth are you still single"" from guys all the time, it's just from the ones I'm not interested in."
2435,Halle Barry contemplated suicide,
2436,Confused and guilty,i wake up feeling sad and i just cry out of nowhere. There are moments when i can't even do anything. Everyone says that i should be happy because i have a good job and im going to school and i have a new car and blah blah but i feel like crap. i dont know whats wrong with me.. there are times when i just break down and cry. Im trying to get over my ex bf..i think im over him because i dont cry over him i just cry because im sad ( does that make sense?) i feel sooo ugly and stupid. Everything has to be perfect or i just wont do it. Please tell me whats wrong with me..If you have any questions about this ill answer them
2437,Why,"This is the first time I've felt scared and bad enough to post in here. I'm starting to plan ways I could kill myself, looking up methods and thinking of what it would be like. I'm not afraid to die and no longer exist. The only thing stopping me is the fear of failure / pain (I'm so gutless), because I already have enough pain, failing would further push people away from me, and if they're going to all abandon me yet again I want to be totally unaware for eternity (ie. dead)."
2438,Suicidal Thoughts Becoming More Frequent,Lately I have been having a rough time.
2439,"I have just lost my aunite, and i want to be with her!","my aunite who im really really close to died at 4 am on sunday, im not coping to well, and now want to be with her, i dont want to live any more not without her, she was like a mum to me! i dont know wat to do the onlky thing i know is that i want to be with her, and not be here alive!"
2440,i'm really trying,but everytime a breakdown someone has to help me back up.
2441,Need detox,"I desperately need alcohol detox but I cannot afford it. At least I don't think so.. how much does it cost? I am drinking almost a fifth of vodka a day to keep withdrawal away; I don't get drunk, ever, nor hungover, but I don't eat or do anything productive, have lost 40 pounds and am suffering pancreatitis."
2443,Poem on NOT committing suicide,"Right guys, i've posted this poem again, because i think it really is inspiring!!"
2444,For Those Who Want to Die - Dream!,You want to die. You feel like you have nothing to live for. Life is boring.
2447,Thoughts of Death,Now I'm not suicidal but I'm planning my funeral and I've never done this before. Last night I saw a video of two teens who died in a car accident while fleeing police. They were sideswiped by a Semi and the car was shattered into pieces. I was shocked initially but later I was internally happy when I thought of it being me. I realized could have a quick exit that would lead to certain death.
2448,Hello everyone :) About life and death! :D,"So, I'm a new member, and my main reason for joining is that I think much about suicide etc, as I probably will execute such an evenent in a semi-near future, within 5 years or so, whatever really, it's not like I care"
2449,Why am I thinking like this!?,I have posted on this topic before and I am back again in the same situation. I have found myself tonight not wanting to live anymore. Me and my ex broke up a little over a month ago now and I am still not dealing with it well at all. I have had good days and bad but tonight is one of the worst. I have been talking with my ex over the phone and saw her a few times since we broke up. I know a lot of people suggest the whole NC thing but we were doing ok with just talking once in a while. I have been on a few dates since we broke up but I won't lie the whole time I have had hopes me and her would end up back together. Anyway tonight I found out she is dating a new guy. When she told me it completely broke my heart. It made me realize that she really does not have any feeling left in her to get back together with me. I still want her back so bad and thinking now that it is not going to happen makes me not want to live any longer. I don't know what to do. I want her back so bad and she doesn't want it at all. I do have family and friends who would be so crushed over me killing myself but I just don't see a reason to live. It is hard to do it when the one thing I lived for is no longer a part of my life. I give up on even writing this post. Screw it...
2450,A Problem,Hi
2451,girls and suicide,"i cant understand why i get so depressed over girl problems with my gf, football camp has started and it seems to lessen the pain somehow but i wont get into details but she is drastically hurting me and it to say it simply and briefly makes me want to die i have already tried to kill myself once and landed in a coma for 3 and a half days so i feel that its not hard to do that again except i hope i will die next time i try if i do living just isnt worth all the pains in the asses that come with living please help show me how to deal with probs and i do weightlift and get a ton of good heavy exercise but they dont numb the pain anymore"
2453,Drown Oneself in the lake,Hello.
2456,HELP! might know someone committing suicide,I think my roommate may be suicidal.
2457,what else is there to say,"Is any suicidal thought unhealthy? Its just recently that I've almost considered following through with them. It feels that an eternal damnation is worth escaping this life. I feel bad enough that i need to seek advise over the internet, but thats just seems where we are as people."
2458,No clue what to live for.,"This is basically a continued story from my other thread I made in the Relationship Conflict forum, please look at that too. I can't link to it."
2460,confused as to reasons for suicide,"What is the reason that even though I feel fine and good generally, I still want to commit suicide?"
2461,I just want to die...,"So... apparently my girlfriend needs a break to think about if she really loves me... she says there is something different about the way she thinks of me now, and she needs to figure out if its love or not..."
2462,Theyre couting on me to commit suicide,Hello..
2463,.......,"i've just been told to go and stand in front of a car, i might do it"
2464,What is the meaning of life?,Rocky
2465,"O my God, have mercy on me...","I was going to take pills and drown myself in a nearby river, what kept me from doing it is that I don't want to inflict pain and guilt onto others. I am deeply suffering. I am stuck and can't seem to get pass through the pain. I am in absolute agony, have mercy on me, please. I am so hurt. I need to be healed. I need people to pray for me despite my lack of faith. O my God..."
2467,Not a question of if anymore,"But a question of ""when""... I've looked at this past year (which sucked, btw) and I look at how far I've been set back. I hate my life. It's useless and stupid. I'm not going anywhere, I've thrown my future away, have no job or hope of survival, so what's the point? I can't talk to anybody about this because almost all of them are fundamentalist christians or ardent atheists who will ""try and make me feel better""... I don't want to feel better... I just want to DIE. There's no way I can have any success because I am the most pathetic man alive. I'm a shallow, careless, selfish person, and this is my predicament... It's not a question of ""if"" anymore... but a question of ""when"". When am I going to lose control of my mind? When will the suicidal beast that wants out of this shell be released? When will the depression fits and apathy end?"
2468,Not sure how to deal with this..,My g/f recently broke up with me and I am not dealing with it well at this point at all... I never thought it would happen if the day came but I am actually thinking crazy thoughts like suicide.. I don't know if I would actually do it because I am afraid to but on the other hand I really do not want to live this life anymore.. I feel so pathetic. I can't afford to get professional help and to be honest I don't think it would do anything. At this point the only thing that would make me feel right again would be getting her back. But I won't so what do I do?.. I thought that every day after we broke up that went by would get slightly easier but the days are getting harder. I don't know if I am emotionally strong enough to do this. She is all I think about and I know she isn't thinking about me which kills me. I want to just not talk to her anymore but she was my best friend and the person I would usually talk to when having a big problem. Now that she is the problem I don't know what to do because obviously I can't talk to her about it.... I just want to give up...............................
2469,I don't know what to do,
2470,I don't know where else to turn right now,I'm putting this in the suicide section because it is a really bad night and I am finding myself thinking stupid thoughts.
2471,Say it ain't so.,
2472,I Hate Myself and Want To Die,"I'm back with my depression/suicidal thoughts. Talked to the ex tonight and she didn't make things any better. I cut myself a lot last weekend..after the break-up. I'm really thinking about purchasing a gun next time and making it quick instead of this agonizing, slow, painful, internally wrenching hurt. I've really gotten to my super low points and it's killing me every time. I'm waving the white flag"
2473,yupper,"Cliche question, but one nagging at my mind all the time. What IS the use, anyways? Me being up there at the top of the ""most useless, pathetic, slacker human"" list for a long time, is wondering his worth in life. Money dominates everything, there's no room for shy people, social darwinism has run rampant throughout this country (not to mention world), and thus it doesn't take a mathematician or even scientist to know that I would probably be the human sacrifice if ever needed. I think I've finally reached the point of being envious of people who piss and moan about their jobs all day long... because at least they're getting paid. Not even Target will hire me. I would work at a gas station or at a convenience store, but I'm afraid of being killed, hurt, robbed, or all of the above on the job. I'd also be willing to work construction, but my mom is still trying to cradle me in her arms telling me it would be ""hard labour on her poor little boy"". Oh well, since I'm worthless, why not? She has no idea what she is talking about, yet she is the one that constantly nags that I haven't been ""trying hard enough"" I've only freakin turned in 11 applications and attempted probably twice as many (but stopped after realizing that all the jobs I can apply for require experience)!!! Ok, so there are people worse off than me.... big help. Would you tell a blind man standing next to a paraplegic that they ""could be worse off?"" I get that crap all the time and I hate it. The dating world is exactly the same way as the job market, so I've given up on it 100 percent. There is no room for me in the world of music. Every time I try to form a band and create something meaningful (art) that can be observed from many different levels and angles, something screws up. I get some annoying tagalong like my friend who has a really egregious ego, is a pathological liar, small-talker, and pretty much crapped on the nearly 5 years of effort I've put into bending guitar strings. He's riding our coattails and thinks we're nothing without him (he told me ""i'm going to make us famous!""). Of course, he has a big mouth (which needs to be sewn shut) and his bass playing is stiff, grooveless, lifeless, and mediocre at best. He's wormed his way into the band I was starting (with little to no permission) and takes over. Oh well, life hardly goes the way I want it. Other times, it just flat out sucks. I'm seriously trying to find a quick, painless, guranteed way to the next afterlife."
2475,Should I tell a friend's family that her overdose was a suicide attempt?,"Yesterday a friend of mine Marie (yes the same Marie from my previous posts) overdosed on pain pills, sleeping pills and liquor. Her family is under the impression that it was simply an overdose, but I spent the 3 days prior trying to talk her out of suicide and into getting some help. She is currently in a coma, and I am wondering if I should tell the family that her OD was a suicide attempt, and show her family copies of the correspondance where I tried to talk her out of it so that they can get her help if she pulls out of this coma?"
2476,I'd rather be dead,Work going is bad..I'm 2 steps away from getting fired.
2477,Legal question,Hypothetical question.
2478,Beyond caring,"I always prided myself on being the nice guy that everyone could depend on, now I'm beyond caring. I've got a crappy car, crappy job, no way to go to college, no romantic prospects, No reason to even get up in the morning. My ""friends"" have pretty much abandoned me since I graduated high school and now they only call me when they want something. I'm at a point in my life where I think that if I got up tomorrow and went to work, that would be fine, but if I were dead, that would be okay too. When I think about committing suicide, I just get this overwhelming feeling of"
2479,a question about suicide?,"just curious, if i was to take my own life tonight in ritualistic fashion by ingesting mad amounts of cocaine and methanphetamines then cut my throat ear to ear and lay bleeding on the floor staring at the cieling wondering why it had to be like this, how much cocaine would it take to kill a 6'2"" 160lb male?"
2481,I think i really need help,"i know hunderds of people have bigger problems than me and thousands of people commit suicide every year, but i dont think im ready to part with this earth which is why im asking for help, it kinda goes as most peoples do, in that i have never really been close to anyone, not even my parents, i have never really had many friends and i tend to just shut myself in my room, but reciently its gone all weird, i made friends got even a girlfriend and i have now been with her for 7 month (not bad for my second relationship) but now comes the time when things become tough, many of you will know my girlfriend, she is an active member of these forums her name is __X and the truth is i really do love her but i cant let her close, well we have been fighting a lot reciently and __X told me that after youth club she had been calling in on a guy, and for some stupid reason i automaticly jumped to the conclusion that she was cheating on me, which was a massive mistake, so after a few text messages where accusations were flying and the fact that our relationship is essentally over and that even if we did manage to salvage it, it would never be the same i thought about all the good i have ever done to the people in my life and i couldnt find a single thing, it just seems that im a horrible person and that ever action i have ever done has resulted in people being hurt, i dont even know why i accused __X of cheating cos i know she wouldnt but now she has gone and the fact that communication in my home is virtually non existant, i just dont feel like there is anything left anymore, there is no point in me going to college because i was planning a future with __X and i dont think i can ever stop loving her, which is why i need help i i want to do it but i cant every part of my body and mind is saying yes but my heart is saying no, its a constant battle and its making me feel worse and worse the more i do it and i cant see a way out of it. So if you have read this post right to the end please feel free to comment as i am so confused and could do with all the help and direction as possible."
2483,Crisis,I have to post this. I'm losing my mind. I have to post this. I'm done. I'm done. I can't hang on much longer.
2484,either way,"Ive been reading these boards for about a few hours, I'm thinking its time to end my life. I think of suicide at least 10 times a week."
2485,don't do it!!!,hey everyone
2486,My life/Poem,Well. . .
2488,I give up!!!,"I give up on girls/love, all I do is get hurt. I'm being myself and girls don't like it. I give up on my job, it sucks, I get paid a crappy wage and I'm HUGE in debt. I give up on music cuz I can't find a good band who's committed. I give up on my ""friends"" they always seem to be busy with everything else. I dream of ending it quite a bit, I think about it a lot..especially when it comes to love. I've heard all of the cliche things that nice guys get and it's pointless and worthless info to me now. Whatev! I might as well be dead and gone"
2490,Advice plz,"Hey everyone hows it going? This is the first time I am posting in this forum topic. Lately my life has been falling apart. Today I failed my drivers exam for my full graduated licence, and I scuffed my tires on my SUV during the exam while . My parents marriage is like falling apart. I'm like failing (barley passing is the truth) almost very course uncept my tech courses. I've failed the past 2 test in physics, the same with math including one quiz. Had some problemswith my girlfriend which we fixed so thats fine. My parents are having some financial problems. I just lost my job at Best Buy, which I loved cause I was doing IPG (computers and computer perihables). Besides automotive I love computers. So the thought of suicide keeps poppin into my head. Ok I would joke around with my friends and with my girlfriend but we were all joking around you know having a good time. But now my life is going down the drain. My friends and my girlfriend have tried to cheer me up but they weren't able to. Not even music was able to cheer me up which usually does when nothing else can. So could someone plz give me some advice."
2492,I'm Done!,I really don't have any reason to sugar coat my life anymore. There is no reason for me to pretend to be happy anymore. No one will ever understand what I am dealing with on a daily basis.
2493,Help!!!,"I feel like im hanging on to life, not living just dragging myself up everyday, the only person who's important to me is my 3yr old daughter, and i dont think im doing her any favors by being around, crying all the time, i want someone to put there arms around me and tell me it will all be ok! im not scared of death, the quiet , no more saddness and thoughts in my head day after day, no one understands, or cares! the world wrapped up in themselves, i feel like im the enemy, the only thing i ever wanted was to meet someone who really loved me, i was enough, and my love for them would complete them, i wanted a family and to never be alone! but i am alone, in my head in my life, i dont know what to do, i need help but there is none!!!! please tell me it will get better, where can i escape to?"
2494,I'm BAAACK,"I'm BAAACK, well not completely but it is a start. I have a new job at a local coal mine driving a 240 ton haul truck, the money is good but the people suck, there is a lot of bad attitude towards new employs and this gets to me sometimes."
2495,why bother...,"Recently it's starting to seem like everything I do is just bringing me back to the way I was in middle/high school. I was constantly emotionally beaten up during those years. I felt like a ghost and depressed. No one ever noticed I felt like this, not even my parents, mostly because I never told anyone. College helped a lot, but recently I've felt like I'm going back to how I felt in middle/high school. I'm just getting so * * * *ing pissed off about this. I've mostly stopped doing most of my school work. Not because Im sick of it, I enjoy it, but because I just don't care if I fail out of college or not. I'm thinking of transfering. I've tried talking to the very few friends I have (I figured they would listen since they dump there problems on me) but it always just seems like when I'm trying to tell somone my problems they aren't really listening and just waiting for their turn to talk. I can't find any inspiration for my art work for classes and I just want to do my own things. All and all I thought I was finally getting out of this equivocal depressed feeling, but am feeling more and more like its just pulling me back in. I don't know. It's like I've been going back and forth between days of extreme happiness and then days of utter despair. If you respond to this please don't give me the redundant answers that I have heard time and time agian. I know it can get better, I know other people are worse off, and I know im not alone in feeling like this."
2496,Do you want to die?,"They watch us, you know."
2497,in AIM with my ex right now HELP,Ana / Nadia says (16:26):
2499,Psychosis... dealing with a loved one,"Hi there,"
2500,Thanks,I owe everyone in this community a post but I cant do it right now. thank you all in advance for everything you have done for me. I would not be here rignt now if it wasn't for your support.
2501,I Just Dont know how to carry on,"Things happen all the time in thies world, but i feel i have been left behind. I feel so lonely and likw such a failiure. Its hard to explain but every minute of every day i have to fight back tears, and the thought of dying actually makes me feel happy."
2502,Attempts,"Have any of you attempted? You don't have to say if you don't want. I have twice. Once when I was 14 after a particularly disgusting, horrible, gross, awful experience and once last year, just when everything got on top of me and I couldn't figure out what to do. The first one I ended up in hospital for a week and the second one no one else knows about. I look back and I don't really feel anything. I don't feel guilty. Sometimes I feel sad that I didn't succeed but then I think, well, I'm only young really and lots of people have been through worse than me and have survived and all that so I should be able to right?"
2503,Take off ur bad feelings,"I'm tired of treating my acne condition everyday,everyhour.....is it still worth.....looks like im wasting my teenage years...damn,already 5 years now and my face is still full of redness and pimples.......i can't hold on. i just wanted to take this off."
2505,I need answers.,"I tried to commit suicide 2 years ago, but here I am. Now I don't want to die anymore, but I can't really enjoy life. I feel all kind of things which just won't leave me alone. For example, when something good happens to be I can't be happy for a long while, because I keep thinking what something bad will happen. I don't understand. If I had a great day and everything went well, why do I feel so depressed at night, thinking of what could happen."
2506,hurt myself,"The last few months I've been frustrated with things and had suicidal thoughts. A job didn't work out, my girlfriend and I broke up, I'm in a place by myself with no friends and no family. I've tried to persevere and never ever thought I'd really commit suicide."
2508,I am doing it to night,I am ending it tonight. I have sent my email to everyone telling them why. I don't want to be talked out of it I just want someone to know
2509,Life,I think that there is a point to life. We are all here and all born the same way and we will all die.
2510,how can i help my friend??,"My friend is on medication for depression and she used to be and might still be a very bad cutter. She seems ok and then all of the sudden she would come to school the next day and have more cuts on her wrist that i can count. When she cuts, its really bad, she cuts really deep and she see's counselors and all of that stuff and shes on medication but it doesnt seem to be helping. In a way im not sure even if i can help her anymore but please if you have an idea or think im out of my mind let me know so i can at least try to help."
2511,How can i help my baby sis!!,"Hello everyone, I am writing because I am very scared right now for the life and future of my baby sister. I have posted for years on this forum crying about myself but for once i am crying for something completely unexpected. I am so torn and scared and anxious right now. My little sis began college this past fall at a very prestigious university. she began feeling the stress all kids do in college. she came home for break and said she was feeling really depressed. the counsleors decided to have her take the year off. she is now home and on anti depressants prozac! OKKKK let me say this is all crazy!!! this never ran in my family and no one has ever been depressed! this is my baby sister! this is all too much! i know that suicide is linked to depression. i have had little training on suicide prevention but i know its good to ask them if they have thought of suicide, how, when, where etc? no one really asked her so I did!!! i didnt want to regret not asking her. so i asked her and sure enough she has had suicidal ideas!! this was very hard for me to take in being her sister. i quickly called my mom and had my sis taken to ER. My sister resented me but i thought i was doing it for the best! all this is happening and i am so freaked out. i am afraid my sister is alone now that she is back from college and home alone while my parents are at work. i dont know what to do. i am a full time student and work as well away from home. i dont know what to do or how to help. i love her so much and if anything happened i would be devasted."
2514,What Point To Life Have You Found?,"A major issue that those suffering from depression deal with is finding a point to life. Thus, suicide can enter your mind. I'm posting this more for those of you that DO see a point in life as I, even though I'm feeling relatively well at the moment, fail to see the point."
2515,I am scum,"I have no doubt that I will be banned for what I am about to say here, If I don't I will have irreparably damaged my reputation here, it is probably totaly out of the depression I am in that I dictate this to you here at the forums."
2517,Can't live like this.,"My mind is killing me. I'm a danger to myself and its getting me crazy! I'm becoming paranoid - always hear someone behind me when there is no one. I also try to get into people's head and try to find out how they think, how they are, what they would think, etc, etc, etc, and this had made even more paranoid - if i do this what will they think, what if i do that?"

2520,is this ever going to end?,"hi everyone, im not suicidal, but very depressed and hoping that someone out there can talk to me."
2522,Rocking On,"I wanted to love you so much. I needed to love you. I gave you everything I could, I loved you the best I could. Everything I did, I did for you. From here on the ground, I loved the hawk in flight...."
2523,not 100% sure,"i've had enough of life, i really can't stand it anymore, i feel sick all the time now because i'm so depressed. all my friends have moved away, and i'm left here all alone and i can't shift the feelings of suicide from my brain. i've thought about killing myself for years but never actually done it because i thought about my friends and how much they made my life worth living. now that i have no close friends, i don't see the point of carrying on. i know that my mom would be traumatised if i did kill myself, her dad did the same so it would be awful if her daughter also did it. thats the only reason i don't want to. i'm going up and down on this but i've thought long and hard about just doing it, once and for all. i can do it on monday, i'll walk onto the train tracks and wait to be hit. it would be dark by then so its not likely anyone will see me and do anything about it. i just wated to get that out of my system because i have noone to talk to about this."

2525,Need Help,"To make a long story short-my life sucks, no one likes me, my parents hate me (at least my mom does), i can't seem to do anything right, and i'm having some problems with other things to"
2528,Read befor you act,Hey
2529,I need some advice please,"ok, i dont know what to do for about 2 and a 1/2 munths now. I have been having this nightmares about me commiting suicide. But I dont want to die im not suicidal or anything.I know I use to be suicidal but im not anymore. But they will not go away and i have tryed just about eveything i know to make them go away. can anyone please help me i really want to be able to sleep good again. if u can help thanks!"
2531,Is it just me?,"I'm not writing this to hurt anybodys feelings, or to come accross as some ignorant jerk. But reading through some of these posts, truly makes me sick to my stomache, and I find it really hard to sympathize with 99% of the people on here talking about how they're going to ""End it""."
2532,why keep trying?,"I really dont want to live anymore.. Occasionally something good will happen in my life.. for example I might meet someone who could become a friend.. but it never lasts, they never actually become my friend. I always screw it up. I have no friends, I dont get along with my family, my job sucks and because I left school early there isnt anything good I can do... I'm working in a bar at the moment! I cant do that for the rest of my life! How pathetic."
2533,My life is a mess,"I never thought I would post in a forum like this, but maybe I just need to purge myself of some of this and get real. I really have no one I can be completely honest with."
2534,Such little thoughts.....,It has been one of those days/weeks/months.
2535,What To Do,Hello
2536,contemplating suicide,"I'm planning my own suicide. I guess you could call it a final cry for help. This isn't just about attention. I've been mentally unstable for amonth. I take medication. I have no friends anymore, I've pushed them all away. My family doesn't care. They are too far away to care. I have no one, and I'm really going to do it. I don't know why. I thought I was getting better. But I'm not. And I don't want to suffer this pain anymore."
2537,Need Advice!,"I just found out that my best friend tried to commit suicide by over dosing on some pills. His GF, whom is also one of my friends, called me up and told me. Here's some background info: They were keeping their relationship secret becuase we're seniors, and shes a sophmore. Her friends were not very accepting of my friend(her BF). Someone told her friends they were going out and gave her two options that were either to break up with him, or loose their friendship."
2538,Please hang on in there !,3 years ago this coming Febuary my brother took his own life.
2539,existential depression?,"Well here I am again, 7 months or more after the breakup with my ex of almost 2,5 years. What's wrong with me? I haven't moved on, not even for a bit. A couple of months back I thought I had fixed my depression or was on the right path out of there. I even tried to help other people on this forum. Lately things have maybe become even worse than right after the breakup!"
2540,Am I forgetting anything before I go?,"OK, so I am going to do it, but I want to make sure that I am not forgetting anything before I do."
2541,My friend told me that she might kill herself,Note: We are freshmen in college.
2542,Supporting a Suicidal friend,"I have a friend that lives in a different state. I got a call last weekend from someone telling me that my friend had tried to slit her wrists the night before and she was in the hospital. My friend has always had issues and always looked for approval in other people, and I think being away from her family and friends (she moved to another state for a guy that she met, whom she found out about a month later was actually married ) brought her to an ultimate low. She drinks way too much and gets depressed and her friends out there are not really what you call friends. She's moving back home now, which is good. But how can I support her? I mean, I want to be there for her, but I want her to learn how to be happy with herself without relying on other people for approval. I want her to learn to love herself. And, in the past when we visit each other, or when she was still living in town with me, all we did was party. With the way she is right now I""m not going to be going out to bars and drinking with her, I think she needs to stop drinking all together. What are things I can do and say to help her, and how should I go about helping her help herself?"
2544,suicide?,"i'm a survivor of a suicide attempt.. i took an overdose of pills 15 tablets 2b exact.. i was uncontrolably scared and unhappy and frustrated.... my parents were not understanding me but instead pressuring me whch lead 2 my suicide attempt th hardest thing abt surviving a suicide attempt is the shame that u face afterwards society places a stigma on u as a 'freak' somebody who's mentally 'unstable'... we who try to commmit suicide r no less sick than cancer patient our pain is real our problems r real.... i regret the night i spent in d hospital wid a tube in side me puming out all those pills... however tryig to commit suicide did not change or solve my problems wen i was realeased from the hospital all my problems were still there. i haven't been cured and i still am sick and depressed and overwhelmingly stressed i do wish 2 die but for wat i went through that night i cannot try 2 take my life again... but i do want to die.. please ppl out there help me fight this my own ppl r not wid me, my bf has left me, he left me in my time of need... i have no one someone pls help why should i live? i need an answer 2 that....i get a tight feeling in my chest everytime i'm stressed and i run tobthe phone 2 call my bf and he doesn't want 2 hear me orsupport me infact he has found another gf... i get up trembling in the middle of the night.. crying uncontrolably.. i cant function properly and my heart is broken my life is broken i cannot live widout my bf i need his support my parents do not understandand r involved in there own probs and i feel itsbetter 2 die than stay another day on this earth grieveing and suffering like this..... i have nothin 2 live 4..... studying getting a good job is pointless wen ur life is filled wid loneliness like minei have nvr experienced tru love or happiness i have always given up my happiness and given 2 everybody else its too over bearing i can't handle watching myself in the mirror, everytime i close my eyes i ask god why am i here? and why r u punishing me? i already took counciling but it hasn't worked, i don't sleep properly.... i don't wanna eat i get blackouts a few times 4 the day... i go deaf wid the silence i'm surronding by i have troubling breathing i'm reaching out 4 help but no ones helping me,i think to myself that god does not love me or care 4me otherwise i wuld nvr b this way but wat have i done 2 deserve this? i am sick and in need i cannot b put on any medication because of my suicide attempt, i cannot b sedated wen i'm in pain.. my body is filled wid pain somedays i can't move but inside of me especially my chest is filled wid anxiety and uneasiness and i feel like if i can see my bf or talk 2 him or just hav him hold me i'll b ok... pls this is my last chance HELP ME B4 I SINK"
2545,Best/Worst/Most painful/Least painful/Messiest Ways...,Opinions on methods of suicide?
2546,I'd really like to end it.,Why was I given such a crappy hand.
2547,Im Losing My Best Friend,"hello everyone, i have a friend, she is going through a lot right now. emotionally she is unstable. she has been feeling depressed a lot in the recent weeks and has been cutting herself. i don't know what to do to help her and to stop her from inflicting herself. the cuts aren't deep, but i'm worried that eventually they shall become so. i ask my friend why she does it and she says she can't pinpoint one exact reason, because it is a lot of reasons, little things like seeing someone or hearing something that gets on her nerves...like someone walking around dragin their feet irritates her and she goes into an irritated state and all those depression feelings rush to her. she goes to counseling but it doesnt help, they have put her on medication, but to me it seems that she has only gotten worst since she started her medication. i don't know what i can do to help her stay happy, things we used to do for fun are no longer fun for her and she's my best friend, i dont want to lose her, she is my only friend. if anyone could please respond with advice on what i should do to help my friend out of this hole... she recognizes that she has a problem but doesn't know the exact source because every little thing triggers it and she doesnt know how to stop feeling the way she does, for me as her friend, i'm dying watchin her do things to herself and be that way...what else can i do for her?????"
2548,I really want to end it ALL!,I am 32 and have been severly depressed for most of my adult life. I have had one boyfriend and one girlfriend my entire life.
2549,A hard hit,"As few of you know, I'm a big fan of Pokemon. My relationship with it has been described as beyond obsessive. Well, a few days ago I found out that the new company that has the rights to dubbing the episodes desided to replace ALL of the origional Voice Actors. (VAs) I grew up with these people as my role modles and only friends. They were like family to me, and now they've been thrust out into the streets to find another job. I was devistated to find out about this. Since I found out I've been the lowest I've ever been. I feel even worse than when my first GF broke up with me. All I been wanting now is for this to either just be some kind of dream, or for the empty feeling inside to just go away. I don't know what else to do, I have nothing without these people, and now there gone forever. I know it's 'different' to feel this way about a show, but please know that this show has been a big part of my life since I was 8 years old and it's been the only part of my life. I do hope you people will listen because everywhere else people just mock me about this and put me down."
2550,2nd thoughts on surviving a fire!,"I was sleeping in the basement and woke up to my mom screaming there is a FIRE- I thought o good Ill just stay down here and die. But after 30 seconds of deciding wether this was my out. I got up and opened the door and this big plum of smoke overcame me and I crawled out to the front door. As I sat there with my mom- (who was hysterical at this point) I debated wether I made the right decision. The fire was a grease fire, she put on some new bacon called Blazzin bacon (seriously -thats its name) and she went outside and forgot about it. Anyhow after 10 minutes waiting for the FDept. They put it out - the damage was mainly to the kitchen but everything had to be taken out of the house because of smoke damage- We have been living in a Holiday inn for the past 3 weeks. This hotel happens to be the MEPS headquarters= Military inlistment prossessing station- anyhow there are new 18-25 men/women enlistments that come every night, and sometimes their faimlys are there to say there goodbyes. While I do respect there future service to this country I, think yeah when you get out of basic, your * * * is heading to iraq and youll probly die- Which sounds like a good idea for me, but I already have a bad back and knee with no cartlidge so I cant enlist- but the recruieter still trys to get me to join up. Well durin the first week there, I went got 2 beers and went to sit in the hottub, and decided Im going to stay in here till I pass out and drown. There wasnt anyone down there, and after about 35-40 minutes I was half unconsious and still sitting up, this lady came over and yelled at me to get up and jump in the pool, which I did. I was beat red and probly had a minor heat stroke-who knows."

2558,"My life, the abyss.","Well, I can't go any lower (no wait, there's the shovel). I'm really thinking about ending it all because I'm a useless piece of crap who can never make a difference in anybody's life. I'm a lethargic, useless, A.D.D to the max, anxiety-ridden, ugly- * * * douche with no talents or aspirations. I'm the most useless human being in the world because I have no money, job, or vital purpose. Hell, I've reached the point where I think I've gone chronically insane. Regardless, I think the world would be a helluva lot better without me."
2559,given up,"im feelin soo down these days. last night i cried soo much. i thought about everything in my life and i cried. the relationship with my mum is strained and i still feel very depressed about us. she shouts at me, mocks me, gives me idle threats which im sick to death of and brings up the fact that im a disappointment every chance she gets."
2560,Found a way,Most people don't care about what i got to say but i care and have feelings
2561,I don't know why i just want to die,hi
2562,Love Is A Disease,"Well, I got back with my ex, and we're still together. This was a VERY stupid mistake, but I just don't have it in me to deny her. I love her with all my being, and despite the horrible pain I've felt over her and the hate that still dwells deep within, I can't get over how I feel for her. After dedicating my every waking moment to loving her, it still wasn't enough for her and she had to leave me for him."
2563,suicidal thoughts,"i guess i just need some reassurance that life IS worth living for...because at the time...it seems like it isnt...im having suicidal and depressing thoughts....NOTHING is going right....or so it seems...and i really want to start cutting again so i can go to my ""numb"" place...no feelings...no nothing...just being there...i use to cut a few years ago and i loved feeling empty...so i dont kno....maybe i just need to be assured that life is worth living for......."
2564,my f'd up life,"i have been suicidely depressed since i was 6. i was medicated for 7 months but after i started hearing voices and vomiting daily i was taken off prozac. when i was 7-9 i ran away from school 4 or 5 times 1 time for 5 hours saying that i was going to go home to commit suicide. when i was in highschool i stayed home atleast 2 days a week and walked around literally in a haze of depression. this is where i met my wife, it was love at first sight, we have been together for 5 years and married for 2. for the longest time she has been attracted to women. i , being a man and pretty sensative yet levelheaded, have encouraged her to explore this side of her because i can't and don't satisfy her. she currently doesn't work but i make more than enough money for the 2 of us. she has always had many emotional issues and takes medication for anxiety. its hard to live with her sometimes but i like her alot as a person. she is my best friend. we have a great dog and nice things."
2566,How to KILL depression.,Ok so im depressed a lot but heres something to try if ur really depressed. Join the militairy! you make be think WHAT?!! WHAT ARE U THINKING THAT MUST BE A REAL DEPRESSION CAUSER!!!
2567,New mom- Just wants to kinda leave,"I'm not to the level of suicide as of yet. I just feel so damn sad and confused. I had a pretty rough pregnancy only because my fiancee called me names and really wasn't there for me. I just felt alone the whole 9 months. He would yell at me or get on to me about something and at that point i was sensitive (naturally) and i would cry and he would call me ""cry baby""among others. I even told him several times to not call me that and it would continue."
2568,quiet-depressed and needs help!,"I never thought I would, but I did 4 years ago. David was and is the best thing to have happened to me. Lately, I have just felt overwhelmed and depressed myself. I usually keep the depressed overwhelmed feelings to myself. I just feel that if I don't say something is wrong, nothing is wrong. The past 2 months I have given myself a rough time. I don't know what is wrong with me, but lately I feel like I am overwhelmed, depressed, and feel that I cannot make him happy anymore."
2569,Euthanasia,I read all the 'I want to die' type postings and don't relate.
2571,soo soo unhappy,"Well I wouldn't really say I am suicidal. I am however, unbearably, unhappy with my life, and my self. I've never felt so unworthy in my life, and it hurts so much. I would never have the guts to kill my self, but I wish every single day I died in my car accident. I don't wanna feel like this, and I hate talking to people because I hate being judged, or told what's right for me, if I don't know, how should anybody else? I am tired of constantly crying my self to sleep, and not wanting to get out of bed every day. And I don't know how to deal with it."
2572,Whats the point?,"I am 27 and for the last 10years plus I've wanted to kill myself. This was simply because I feel there is no point to life. I think it started when I was about 14. That was when I took my first overdose ‘just to see what would happen’. Nothing did, was sick for a few days but was fine after a while and never told anyone about it. Finally about 5 years ago I was so depressed with the pointlessness of everything – and don’t get me wrong, I had a boyfriend, family, friends, was in uni, everything was ‘great’ – but was ill so much and I knew it was because of the depression, then I took an overdose that did leave me in hospital for some days. I couldn’t even do that right; I was told I didn’t take enough to even require stomach pumping! Anyway when I came out of hospital, my mum talked to me about it and she cried. That’s the only thing that stuck – ‘I made my mum cry!’ and that was – and still is - the only reason why I didn’t try to get it right."
2575,Who Here has tried to commite suicide?,"I have, I was going to stab a knife into my hart. My romemate came in and fought for the knife. I am so glad he did that. I am not happy with my self for trying. I know it is the wimps way out but at the time I could not see the light. That was 4 years ago. The thing that helped me the most was Enotalone. I know it sounds corny. I just wanted to tell you all thanks for being there for me."
2576,sooooo sick and tired!,"Hey whoever reads this,"
2579,I'm quite messed up- REALLY,"Most of the people in here seem to be a better type of person than I am, less messed up in a fundamental way. I am not talking about depression, saying your not as unhappy as me, just well your probably not as much a social freak."
2580,I Feel Stupid Posting This,"Just because this forum's here, I guess I might as well."
2581,trying to fight it,"I feel like i am way too close to the edge right now. I havent done anything yet but I want to just end it. I cant pinpoint whats wrong, im not sad or anything i just feel id- well id rather not feel. Im head over heals in love and I am told that she loves me back and that makes me happy. but my day to day life is getting harder to deal with like bricks being stacked on my chest and it feels like my stomach is on fire i cant eat or sleep and all i do is think of either killing or dying."
2582,need help desperately the inevitable has to implemented sooner rather than later,"It is imperative that i carry out this suicide attempt sooner rather than later as the longer i wait, the harder it is for me to carry it out due to reasons that i cannot disclose. I have attained a university degree when the odds were obviously stacked against me. I had to endure a self help life in university. I had to depend on myself and my own resources when i had trouble in my studies, all thanks to morons who base their decisions on stereotypes. University is supposed to be filled with joy but mine is infested with students and staff that treated me with complete apathy. This obviously exacarbated the existing problems that i already had before even entering uni such as severe depression and anxiety. Worst of all, my parents showed no indication of joy and i even get told off for finishing a degree that i could have easily screwed up under the circumstances. Furthermore, i dont have a realistic chance of getting a job becuase it will be very apparent to employers how screwed up i am. I rather kill myself than condemn myself to a life on the streets and it is going happen eventually and i want to kill myself before that happens"
2583,How many,Sleeping pills does it take
2584,What to do if you suspect someone is suicidal..?,"I'll keep this brief, one of my friends had a lot of issues, and she used to tell me about them, at the same time she was paranoid that I wasn't trustworthy, and she was prone to massive moodswings. Fed up and deeply hurt, I terminated the friendship."
2585,Can I have alittle advice?,
2586,"Suicide, suicide attemps, self harm, is it about control?","hey everyone,"
2587,least painful way,"what would most people here say would be a way to kill urself pretty fast and not extreamly painful and still be able to have an open caskit??? guns wouldn't work, ur family and friends wouldn't be able to see you, and that's not right, that's something most people need to have in order for them to really realize someone's gone and not comeing back."
2588,"I'm stuck, at work and home. Please advise !","Hi everybody, here's my story, I just don't know what to do ..."
2589,thinking about suicide,i have been really down in the blue lately because i have been losing a lot of my friends because i have a learning disability and i have a hard time reading and spelling plus i have temped suicide 2 time every week for the last month because i feel like there is no one i can really talk to and have them really understand how i feel because my parents act like I'm there angel and i get in to more trouble with cops then any one i know. i just want to know how can i keep the friends i still have and get my old friends back or get new friends and not lose them.
2590,Thinking bout it again,"I was doing well until recently but now i've completely lost the will to go on again. Im so bored, i just don't care about anything, and i'm getting tired of rejection. Even the caring, religious friends of my sister think i'm a hopeless case."
2591,Suicide Attempts?,"I don't understand how so many people have had multiple 'suicide attempts' but never managed to kill themselves? Are they really honest attempts, or instead cries for help? Or is the human body hardier than most people anticipate?"
2592,my close call,i looked back on when i tried to kill myself. it was after my ex raised his hand on me. used me as a punchbag. i remember glancing at the bruises all over my body and i felt soo weak and pathetic.
2593,"another day, miss you mom","sunday marks the forth year since my moms suicide... she was successful that day. my uncle took her off the machine ten days after that... next wednesday for that day of hell...then he called me... at work...its not his fault, we hadnt talked in a long time... now things are better between us...(him and i) strange... this sunday i will be going to a bbq at my girlfriends dads..(do i want to go...no) this will be the third year she has forgotten...(was i asked if this weekend was a good one for going to her dads? um...) she wants to see the new puppy..what... i expressed feelings that id rather not join... and that i might have something to do...but i dont want to get in the way of the things she seems to be happy about... we are just doing better... and she wants to see her father and step monster plus their newborn and some new puppy... joy...insert fake smile..."
2594,I've felt like killing myself lately,"my whole life sucks. I have no friends, every ""friend"" I ever made eventually started calling me a loser and a * * * * * *. that's all I ever have in my head, memories of people making fun of me and calling me ugly. I couldn't even beat those kids up because they were the group I hung out with so if I did beat them up then I'd have NO kids to hang out with and I'd feel like crap so I let them mentally abuse me everyday."

2598,best way to go,what would be your perfect way to go?
2599,Death seems like a 'relief' to me...,To actually think about this would have to be determind by how you see death - about what each individual believes what happens after life.
2601,is it so wrong? why?,"would it be such a bad thing if i died? I mean i am unhappy, i hate my life, i make other people miserable, and im going nowhere fast in life. the way i see it death is the absolute neutral and life is the process of leaving neutral. I have been worse than neutral, teetering on the bad side since i was 7 and ive been steadily declining. no wouldnt going back to neutral be a sensible idea? i need guidance, is what im considering so wrong? and why?"
2603,Is suicide good advice?,I was just thinking to myself (dont judge Im not crazy. Just thinking) at what point what it be good advice to tell someone to kill themselves.
2604,It's Never Far From My Mind,"I've tried so many times to get my life on track. But I've failed time after time. I just lost another job, I'm a wreck. My relationship with my boyfriend is heartbreaking. I have no emotional support. My Dad just gets angry and shouts when I'm upset. I've been wandering around all day with tears streaming down my face, shaking, making myself sick, with so so SO much pain, so much loneliness and no idea how to deal with my problems anymore and no one to help me. I've hit my arms in frustation, scratched at them. I'm just sitting here rocking crying. I'm so so scared of myself. I don't know what to do. I keep thinking about taking pills, I can't do this anymore. I can't keep... I don't want to be here anymore. I don't want to be here. God help me."
2605,"im already dead inside, why not finish the job?","forgive me in advance, im running low on my trade-mark sarcastic wit tonight. Ive finally hit bottom, my legs broke and i ahve no desire to get up. this life has done nothing but throw one terrible event after another at me and im sick of it. I want to die, i dont think ill make it to tomorrow i dont know if i need help or what i just thought id update you all on my lovely state of mind at the moment, if i survive to see tomorro ill update you again,"
2606,Pigeon Vs Toucan Complex - And Suicide,I have been known of a desperate evening to pace my end of the house for some hours in an attempt at a kind of meditation to ascertain exactly why I'm having negative feelings/suicide ideation.
2607,I hate God,"Why doesn't God care about the people he created. He created me and abandoned me to a lonely cruel world. I hate him so much, i have always believed in him and prayed the same prayers for about 15 years now. no answer. I have become so bitter to him that I curse him everyday. I would rather kill myself and go to Hell than live my life of agony, loneliness and despair. I have tried asking God to take away my pain for many years. i have wanted to kill myself since my early teens, I'm now 27. 27 years old, alone and desperate, desperately wanting love but there is no one whom loves me and i'm always alone. i miss my ex that i went out with for 2 years, i miss a few other girls too, not many serious relationships but have gotten my heart so broken many times. my heart feels like a pile of sharp shards now, and it sometimes literaly hurts from the emptiness inside me. i don't cry myself to sleep almost every night now. instead, i feel disappointment, sadness, loneliness, fear of the future and I also feel partly numb."
2608,Tried to get Help and They make it worse,:shocked!: I have been extremely sick and people are that useless they make it worse. Today trying to get help I rang an emergency no. and he said he doubted if I would last the week what a piece of !#$^. When people are upset isn;t it plain basic commonsense to try and offer encouragement.He just made me feel it was 10 times more hopeless. Have already taken heeeaaapppsss of pils :shocked!: I feel that the entire human race is full of sub human morons and want so badly to die because people are beyond bearable.
2609,To what end?,"The title of this thread may be a bit missleading, I apologize for that. I find the words ""To what end"" occouring more and more in my thoughts and writing."
2610,I want to die,Goodbye world. Im failing every class im in. I havent had a gf for over 4 years now and im living at a broken down house and my only source of internet contact is a friend. Im going to go blow my head off now because i luckly saved up enough money to by a used gun from my friend.
2611,my life is so perfect... my sucide is just an accident..,To
2612,i need help i think,"Well, i hav no1 else to talk to... i found this site i jus needa vent my problems i think i need advice"
2613,What would it be like if you had never been born??,"Ever wonder how it would be if you weren't born, if you didn't exist in this world (just thoughts by the way, no real action)?"
2616,Tired of living,"I am going to end my life...and really there isn't much turning back. I have sought out help only to have people turn their backs on me. i went a church for help, but they just belittled my problems. i went to a therpist and all she really did was treat me like a number. i was sent to the hospital after trying to end my life and basically it was nothing more than a kennel for humans. and my family doesn't care either. i mean i know they mean well, but they could care less about me right now. for awhile a counselor at school cared, but then he turned his back on me when things started to get worse. and then there is God...i know i will offend christians by saying this, but i hate God very much right now. people can say that's wrong, but what's wrong is that i tried to seek help and i of course tried to help myself, but it didn't matter at all. am i wrong to cry out for help?"
2617,How do you get past the desire to..,I keep wanting to die. If you knew my circumstances it is unbearable. I feel it is a necessity to die. Reasons...
2618,Ive fell down and i need help getting back up...,"Hi everyone,"
2619,2nd To Last Poem That I'll Ever Write,I wrote this at work this morning. In have to take breaks through-out the day to go to the bathroom and cry. Only a few more days of this.
2620,hi,I've been so depressed lately. Whenever i'm alone the depression comes back and when i'm around people it just goes away. I need someone so bad and i don't have anybody to turn to. My bestfriend has a boyfriend and when i called her last night she didn't answer her phone..nor did she call me back and i don't have a boyfriend...i don't know what to do. Last night i was so alone and i thought of running away or even suicide but i know that's not the answer. I feel like nobody cares and the feeling never goes away. Any advice?
2621,me again sorry,"](*,) Well i need to get some things off my chest befor i brust."
2622,Help Me Pleaseeeeeeeeeeee,"](*,) hi !!!!"
2623,Poem,"I am tired of fighting; I've had enough of life,"
2624,feeling suicidal again?,"i keep having these recurring negative thoughts about one particular girl who i never got to sleep with... my thoughts that are negative are much worse than the reality and my mind goes spinning out of control , without a doubt, i feel so low inside, i want to kil myself again and theres no one here to talk to or help me? what do i do? ive called the distress center 3-4 times and i just tell them why i wont kill myself.. but i dont feel like they can help me i feel like i bring myself up telling myself that its all going to be alright i dont feel like my family is here either i dont feel like anyone brings me up i do feel however that that girl who hurts me still cares about me in some ways then again everything is too confusing.. i need some quick advice and help on what to do? P.s i have very low self esteem im trying to get a cousiler but keeping positive till then may be very difficult...what to do?"
2626,why are relationships such a big deal?,"Ive noticed lately that alot of people who are suicidal are so because of not having a boyfriend or girlfriend. It seems that if someone turns 25 a virgin they feel their life is meaningless.I can understand people considering suicide because of a lost love,(as I myself do on a semi daily basis), or feeling unloved by parents, but not having a bf or gf? i dont understand that. Can someone explain to me why this is so important to everybody?"
2628,At the end of my rope,"I am new to this forum but not new to depression. I have suffered from it most of my life, and can remember few times when I have ever been happy."
2629,Frustrated in this Life....,"I been trying to improve on my life, been trying to be a little more social, i try striking up jokes with people, but i cant seem to make no one like me, i see how evryone has grace in talking and jus interacting with people, for example my friends. I been posting in the dating and shy people threads, ive also been to many sites on how to improve ones social skills, ive tried putting them into practice...but it seems no girls likes me, simply because my personality sucks like heLL, im really sad about this...im not a bad looking guy, maybe i have a few defects but i seen average lookn mofos like myself with really hot girls, yet i cant get nothing, and if i do its because maybe God feels sorry for me and sends down an angel...ima be honest with all of you, im depressed, i feel like im not going anywhere in life..i dropped out of highschool at 16..since then i havent been able to maintain a job, my self confidence has been really low...sometimes my emotional afflicion makes me want to go out and commit a crime or do something to myself, sometimes not having the will to live, i dont know what to do i feel depressed...i feel unwanted, godamn i feel like i dont belong on this earth like im some kind of alien..nobody wants to be near me, i feel like an outcast"
2630,New Thoughts On Suicide,I can't help but to question everything. I'm constantly searching for answers to those certain questions; Why are we here? Why am I aware? Why was I born me and not you? Why am I this way or that?
2631,Hopeless...,This is kind of an aimless post... just some stuff I need to get out somewhere.
2632,Something I'd like people to think about,I've been around for a quite a while. I've seen a lot of things on this forum.
2634,"Suicide - the coward's way out? Well then, call me a coward!","After the past few weeks I've had, I think I now know why people kill themselves. They get so beaten down and tired of all the bull**** that they just give up. Hope is great, but if you have nothing to hope for, then why continue living?"
2635,I can't take it anymore,"I don't know why im typing this in public, im writing my suicide note after this."
2636,I wish there was a quick and painless way of killing myself.,"The only way I can think of doing it would be to use a gun, but I don't know how difficult it would be to get hold of one in the UK. I wish I lived in America."
2637,Read before you pull the trigger,"Hi, I usually post on another section but was looking around and found this section and wow there are some sad folks here. Here is my background, when I was 16 I was dumped by the ""love of my life"" as a lot of us were back then, and of course life sucked because I was 16. So I took some heart medicine of my mothers, and as I was feeling all warm and starting to fall asleep, something got me to call 911. Well a short time later, a stomach pumping, and a stay in intensive care, so much had changed!! I was still 16, life still sucked and the girl was still dumping me!! Certainly that all would have changed if I had died? Right?"
2639,dealing with suicidal thoughts?,"i get suicidal thoughts every couple of months and i try to get my mom to give me some positive feedback when i do so i dont end up killing myself... but life is getting hard when you have to make people raise you up i deserve better than this i shouldn't have to force my mother to give me positive feeback in life she should do it herself because she loves her son...? am i right? anyways i end up getting kicked out of my house every year either for something stupid or because im angry about my past couple years and what my parents have put me through as a person weather it be child abuse or it be lack of understanding etc. i almost killed myself a couple months ago and i dont want to have these thoughts of knives in my head but i know i can be weak minded and my mind can stray like every other humans can, cause ive been through religion and heck my thoughts arent perfect sometimes i might be like im god out of knowhere what im saying is i have impure thoughts and im sure everyone else does, but i dont want to have thoughts of suicide nevertheless i do and dont know what to do when i have them...any advice on what to do? why do i feel sucidial? how do i stop the thoughts of suicide? and how do i keep from talking about my problems to the girl that i end up with? cause for their sake i tell them this is whats wrong and that and that by the end of it i dont want to be with them..... and sometimes they with me... what to do? in both relationships and life?"
2640,Thanks for your replys,"Hi im new here,"
2641,No Belief In Euthanasia,"Here are my arguments, for and against. It ties in with suicide and the right to live or die we each have as humans. Tell me what you think."
2642,honestly what is the point?,"i haven't posted here for a couple of months. reason: i tried to kill myself in march but couldn't go through with it and ended up in hospital soon after. i put a plastic bag over my head and inhaled helium, it must have done something though because i ended up having seizures a few days later. now i am on enti-epileptic medication and antidepressants. i'm in a haze."
2643,hate life,"everybody dislikes me, makes fun of me calls me fatass,fatty, fatshyt whatever to get in my nerves everytime i go to the lunch line they say ""dont hurry the food aint gonna run away"" or if i hold whatever they will always say make sure u dont eat it. my grades are bad my life is bad my parents are probably ashamed of me. i like never listen to them no one understands me. i tried going on a diet but then my friends i known for years just made fun of me and even made a bet i wont even last an hour, all my friends wear blue green and other colors and only one day i wear blue or red they start calling me a wannabe gangster and stuff everyday i think of just suiciding and get ridden of these shameful things."
2644,:( don't know my problems... :'(,"I've been feeling so down and so lonely lately and sometimes i cry because of what i think...i start to think that my best friend cares more about her boyfriend than me and i think that she would choose him over me any day ...i know it's really stupid but i can't help myself...she calls him more than me, she hangs out with him more than me and i just simply don't feel loved i had told her before that i was depressed and she said that she'd always be there for me but i don't feel like she meant it nobody understands me or cares about me...it's also my family, they make me feel like * * * * and my mom tells the whole world about my personal issues...i'm usually happy when i'm with people but as soon as i'm alone (even if its only for a day) the feeling comes back and it just won't leave me alone...i wish i had someone to share my thoughts with..like a boyfriend or sumthing...but a good one is hard to find...it's a heavy feeling of emptiness and i don't know what to do about any of my problems ...i've thought of suicide even tho i'm against it and it just doesn't seem like the answer but someone told me that it may be the only way to get rid of the pain...are there any other ways to stop this feeling?? i really need help and i really need to talk to somebody but i feel like i have nobody to turn to ...if i turned to my friend she'd think i'm always unhappy whenever she dusn't give me attention...and that isn't true...what can i do??"
2645,Finished,Hello an goodbye

2650,emergency please.. my bf could die,what are the effects of injecting penecillan (however u spell it). he injected it last night trying 2 kill himself and now half of his body is numb. at the time of injection he said he couldnt breathe and he wont go 2 a doctor now.
2651,My Ordeal,"I have been coming to this site for a few months, and at times it has really helped me. I wanted to retrace my ordeal from this past weekend in the hopes that maybe it will help someone else."

2654,"To be Dead, not simply dead inside",I want so badly to end this miserable life of mine.
2655,I have a question... I did this to myself last night...,"Ok so I have been having a rough time of it lately. I had a counselor and he just switched me over to a different counselor that specializes in certain things that I needed. Anyhow, I just started with her - about 3 sessions I think - and I think she's pretty ok. I mean, she does a good job with me."
2656,When will I feel happy again?,"I have had savere depression since I was 9 and I even get suicaidal about once a month. The only thing that keeps me from trying to kill myself again is the fear of failing and only making my life worse. I'm on antidepressents, but they don't seem to work at all. What should I do to try and feel happyiness again?"
2657,i wanna die,"i'm drunk,fell like crap,wanna die..."
2658,what is wrong with me again i wish for death,"all the pressuure seems to close in on me, from school, from being expected to accomplish great things in sports my mother is crazy she is always yelling, my depression, the fact i put myself in a coma before with pills in a suicide attempt, feelings of emtieness and the feeling that iam hollow. every day is horrible, thier just battles after battle after battle after battle after battle... no one would expect me to be suicidal or be depressed, why would i be i have everything! friends , a girlfriend who loves, outer strength, but i dont know all and everything has a good side and a bad side when u do what i have done in sports and life it seems that u r expected by all to keep doing this until u fail or die and if u fail you are now worthless and meaningless to everyone. i dont know thats just what it feels like and some things i havnt metioned because iam far too tired to go into detail about everything. iam sick in the mind i want to die and... well theres a bottle of pills sitting id say.. about 2 feet away from me theres relief about 2 * * * *ing feet away from me. maybe everyone will think differntly about me when they are notified of the fact that iam dead. iam just to tired of fighting uphill battles with everyone and everything iam spent and dont know what to do and thats why i posted this short and typical cry for help, maybe someone can adivise me on how to deal with overwhelming problems well thier overwhelming to me"
2660,Am i crazy,"Hello my name is nicky , im not whining i just need to know if im crazy."
2661,I want this life to end,"For a few years now I have felt miserable, despite having friends, family, job, etc.... I feel extremely out of place, unconnected with everyone and everything around me."
2663,Suggestions on how to do it?,"So I'v been planning my death for a while now and I'm pretty sure how I want to go but I'm always open to suggestion. I don't want to die too quickly, I want to feel it if theres anything interesting during the dying process. The key is to loose consciousness slowly so I can be as aware as possible when the moment comes when I go under. So my guess is that I have to bleed for a while..."
2664,I hate my life,I Hate MY Life
2665,Averting my suicide,"I almost wish I was straightforwardly suicidal, instead of this determination to hang on mixed in with a real wish to die."
2667,i'm still here after all,"i couldn't go through with it last night, or today. i had set myself up for it but it seemed too strange and unnatural, just try 1 more week i thought."
2669,Couldn't do anything to stop her!,"We all get depressed from time to time in our lives. Some people live with it all the time. Unfortunately, I'm one who lives with it constantly and when bad things in life happen it only makes it worse."
2670,Trapped (long),"This is going to be one of the weirdest topics I've ever written on here, yet I'm very serious about it. Yes, I am an avid poster on here, however I have created a new account quite honestly because I am too scared to use a regular identity to post this thread. Hopefully the mods won't say what my other account is, and if creating another account for this purpose is wrong, hopefully they will just delete it. I assure you I am not trolling."
2671,Going to commit suicide,"Hi, I'm writing and sending this text, not like most of you, to find a solution to my suicidal thoughts, but for just a need that i have, something that i don't know myself what is and can't explain."
2672,If you had a gun what would you do??,I no exactly what I would do if I had a gun.
2673,Girls I like don't like me,"I work 7 days a week (sometimes) so I don't go out much. I don't drink..so i don't go to bars. I meet a lot of girls online. Well it seems like the girls I like or date online, can't deal with the distance...I'm always the stronger one that doesn't care about distance, probably because my last real girlfriend was in 1999, so bein alone is not unusual for me. I'm ALWAYS the one who tries to make things work out. A lot of girls I meet are under 18 or else they lie about their age. Speaking of lying about age..I met this girl who told me she was 19..well 4 days afterwards she told was 13 and at this time we were ""dating"" and she's telling me that she wants to have a family with me and marry me. (and yes she knows my age). I can't deal with this crap anymore. I'm so depressed and wanna die (all the time) i'm so alone..sooo alone."
2674,what's happening?,"Most people would think I am successful. I am 60, but married to a woman half my age. I am intelligent, and certainly not in financial trouble. I have a daughter of 18 months with my wife (I love my daughter immensely). I'm in good health. But I feel menaced by death. I've never been depressive, although I had a violent and disturbed father. Strangely enough I feel worse following his death about two years ago than I ever used to feel. I always felt tough, on top of things. I din't let failure upset me. but suddenly it all looks blank, and this feeling has been growing and growing on me for about ten years. What's happening and what do I do? Therapy might be difficult - I'm a member of Mensa, and usually more intelligent than the people I meet (though not necessarily more successful). I'm a privileged and lucky person in many ways, but I've lost my will to live. Does any of this sound familiar to anyone? Please help if you can. Sorry I can't be more coherent, but I just don't understand why the hell I feel this way."
2675,Value of Life,I'm posting on here to hear what you people believe. I'm hoping to get some detailed answers to this post. I have a few topics to discuss.
2676,I am nobody,"Dear all...I'm writing this because I feel I've nowhere left to go. I feel so depressed and lonely inside that I just want to kill myself, right here, right now. My life is a charade. I have nobody. Every weekend is spent alone in my home. Nobody ever calls me. Nobody ever wants to go out with me. I must be the biggest loser and everybody's just laughing at me. I don't know what to do or where to go to find people. I just want die atm and then I wont have to care anymore."
2677,the ache just won't stop.,"so i'm sure that a few of you have noticed that i haven't been doing too well lately. maybe it's just part of my normal rollercoaster-like depression. not that i've ever been diagnosed... but anyways! for a couple days, maybe even just over a week, i was doing good. granted, it was mostly because i'd decided that i'm not going to live past my 20th birthday, which is only a few months off. things just seemed easier to handle once i'd gotten that all decided and such. only then i stopped sleeping again. so i started drinking again, and since that doesn't actually help anything, and it got worse, and i started hallucinating again, i started getting high again. because when i'm high i really"
2678,wishing I was dead,"Do you ever feel like there is no hope? I feel like nothing is ever going to change in my life. Problems get better and then become problems again. I am having a rough day. It is one week from the due date of my son and still no contact. My child support to my ex wife is going up and I have a stack of bills waiting to be paid. My customers are taking their sweet time paying me,RRRR... I would never actually do it but I have been having this fantasy of killing myself. I need closure or contact or answers to which of all, I get none. I see little babies and it makes me want to cry. I hate seeing family's with their newborns because I will not have that with my son. It feels like my insides are being torn apart when I see family's together and happy. Here I am, going to be the father of two with different women and to not be a family is going to be very hard for me. My daughter will have a half brother who has a half brother but isn't her brother and he has a half sister who has a half sister. Yeah, no joke. I feel like an episode of Jerry Springer."
2681,No Melodrama,"..here, more a vent or update or whichever from a very, very tired person who ultimately has just had enough."
2682,Can't take it anymore,I don't know how I can keep going. The love of my life for 18 years is gone. Our divorce is final march 2nd. I can't think of any reason to live. I am finished don't have anything left.
2683,When Someone say they love me what I hear,"Is, ""I love you and now I claim the right to take advantage of you, use and abuse you, and if you complain or attempt to stop me I will not love you."""
2684,I'd rather die on my feet than live on my knees,"Everyone always says that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem, but I think it's more like a permanent solution to permanent problems. The easy part of my life is over, last time I remember I was happy was when I was under 13. After that it has mostly been 95% chronic unhappiness."
2686,it's just gone.,I don't value my life anymore.
2687,Drowning and Afterlife,I've been wondering for awhile what afterlife is going be like or is like...
2688,Our Purpose In Life,There were many times in my life where I was very depressed and felt that life was pointless. Over the past few years this has really changed as I've devoted myself to search for my purpose in life. I now feel that each of our lives has a specific purpose. I have recently started a
2689,Why live a lie,I was 16 when this started. I had come hoem early from school because my football coach was giving me crap about how i dont fully us emy potential.

2690,I don't really know what I'm asking for here...,"Uh, hi. I need help. I don't know what to do. I really wanna die. Life just really sucks. No one would really care if I killed myself. The only problem is I'm scared to do it...help me."
2691,i really dont think im going to make it through tonight.,i hate myself more than any of you could possibly imagine. i hate everything ive ever done or said or anything. i hate every little thing about myself. i do not want to be me. my girlfriend broke up with me and i know why- ild break up with me too- im every bad thing you can think of and i hate it. i dont even know why i do certain things i do. i just want to die. i no longer wish to be me. what do i do? i cant change everything about myself- thats impossible. i HATE IT i HATE MYSELF more than rap or good charlotte or bass guitar or guys who hit girls I HATE MYSELF. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? on top of that i have nothing left in life except one good friend who is in the same position i am and a job making minimum wage that i dont even know if i can handle now because im so upset and i dont know if ill be calming down anytime soon. in fact im sure i wont. i need a purpose or some advice or someone with something magic that will fix me.
2692,Anti-depressants ?,I was just hoping to get some input from people who have been suicidal in the past and tried taking anti-depressants (prescribed of course) to help them?
2695,One last thing,I have made quite a few posts on here.
2696,To those wanting death,There are so many people who have struggled to survive. There are so many who died and wanted to live. There are so many who would give anything to breathe in the air of summer mornings again but disease takes them away.
2697,end of the road- why bother?,"I am going to end my life tomorrow, i will be found dead in my car with a plastic bag over my head. i have finally reached this point, having suffered from depression for all of my adult and adolescent life."
2698,I want to die,"I swear each year my life keeps on going downhill. I have huge financial debt. Girls treat me like crap being I'm too nice and I'm not doing the career that I went to tech school for. I'm 26, I still live at home, I have no girl and most girls my age are already married or have kids. I love kids and I want kids, but in order for me to do that I need a girlfriend. I have a spending problem and the band that I'm in I'm not happy with. Every time someone (female) hurts me I cut myself or threaten to cut myself. Why live any longer?"
2699,Why is my life a joke?,"Okay before I say anything else, I will say that I have dealt with depression before and I finally got over it after a reasonable period. However, just lately I have been really depressed to the point where I am thinking up ways about how I will kill myself."
2700,Prochoice,"I strongly believe suicide is a waste of life, even though I tried to take my own life at one point."
2701,really calm about what i'm doing,"i have bought the stuff i need to commit suicide- it was almost like an out of body experience doing that- very strange. i feel in control, not desperate like before, but still wanting to end it all."
2702,I have thought about IT today...,"I have never even remotly wanted to die, but today I seriously felt it would be better."
2703,Can't Stop Thinking,I cannot stop thinking about life and God and what's real and what's not real and what's naturally human and what's not naturally human and do we have souls? and what does and doesn't have a soul? My brain will not stop.
2704,please help,"i dont want to write a book in describing my problem so ill try to make it fast,"
2705,So scared,"Yesterday sucked so bad you have no idea. I get very affected when left alone, I don't know why. I get depressed. lack of concentration. lack of motivation. lack of... inspiration. then stress because of work that should be done. stress leads to anger with myself. this leads to temptation to SI. (didnt do it though). This then leads to stupid stupid thoughts to just end my life. I mean. It's so easy, yet so difficult."
2706,How Should I Handle This? Please Reply!,"One of my best friends is unhappy with her ENTIRE life. She says everything is going wrong. She slits her wrist, mouths off, does drugs and just doesn't care about anything. I wasnt to help her but I just don't know how. I talk to her about it all the time. She says it's what keeps her fomr killing herself! I don't know. I;'m running out of things to say to comfort her. She wont go see anybody about getting help, so she's completely on her own except for me. No body wants to deal with her. It's so weird. They just don't like her. She gets upset about that too. When she tells people what she thinks they laugh at her. I'm her only support. I try my hardest but I am also tying to get through life. Any advice?"
2707,bad day,"felt really low today, drove around on my way home looking for good offing spots. i feel like i am on a collision course here. does anyone know what i mean? i have heard people say they feel calm, almost euphoric, sometimes before attempting suicide. is this true? i feel very strange definitely. hope i last to make my appointment."
2709,When the world turns its back,"I honestly don't know where to start. I would have never thought i'd be going through all of this. Always thoght it's going to be someone, but not me. no way."
2710,hello & why i am here,"hello, new to this website."
2711,I don't want to do it anymore...,"Hi everyone. I'm having a really hard time making it through each day, and each day the suicidal thoughts get more and more prevalent. I really don't feel like I care what happens to me anymore."
2712,My sis tried to kill herself today,"This morning my 16yr old sister took an overdose in her bedroom. I heard her crying and me and mum went in and found her crying on the floor next to a load of empty pill packets and a suicide note. It was so awful, we had no idea anything like this was going on in her head. We got her to a hospital immediately and luckily she's fine. Apparently she did it because she is really behind in her schoolwork - her final exams are in June - and she didn't see anyway out."
2713,Bipolar. Denied treatment,"I'm 21, I'm a college student. I have a degree already and I'm working on a 2nd one, in computer security."
2714,Questions on my...situation,"Hi all, and thanks for reading this. i have a few basic questions about suicidal thoughts that i would like to have answered."
2715,Do you feel suicidal or depressed? READ THIS!!!!!,*****READ THIS READ THIS READ THIS READ THIS READ THIS*****
2716,just wanted 2 let you all know iam dying tonight,"hey if you want to post i might still be here, if i dont then you know iam gone"
2717,I have been having some suicidal thoughts lately ...,"Some of you may remember me, some of you may not ... I use to post here often and encourage people."
2718,Suicidal? Try this.,I hope this helps. I am trying to share my view on suicide with as many people as I can on this board.
2719,suicidal or not?,"i'm just curious. this chick that i know asked me like 4 years ago if i was suicidal since i always isolate myself. i do isolate myself a lot, but does this really mean i'm suicidal? could she be right?"
2720,I've failed again,"I have helped many in my life from killing themselves, however, I've failed twice. The first time, the peron hung himself, this time (happened on Sunday), the girl, with her best friend went into the path of an oncoming train after hugging eachother. I feel as though I've failed them. I know there was nothing I oculd have done to save them, didn't even know there was a problem of that nature. Sadly, I know there was nothing I could have done and that thought just makes me feel worse. I feel depressed and nothign is helping, it's becoming a problem with my friendships too... Thank you in advance."
2721,I dont get it...,"We were driving home this afternoon and we drove over this bridge here in melb called the westgate bridge that is over 850 metres high. every week there is at least ONE suicide, where one person pulls over and leaps off. The media is forbidden from publicising this of course as they dont want to give out any more inspiration to those feeling fragile."
2722,"work to live, live to work, i have no work, i have no purpose","when i was younger i always imaged myself, when i had finished highschool, to be going out with a great boyfriend, having a part time job, heaps of friends and had done well in my exams. well guess what, i finished my VCE/HSC this year, less then a month ago, and i dont have a boyfriend, i dont have a part time job and my friend circle is small and limited. this really cracked down on me today, where i started thinking that i have already failed my life. and if no one is going to employee me now, what makes them want to employ me later on in life. it was only today that because of no job, no boyfriend, that i felt unless, and unwanted. all my friends have part time jobs. admittely not all of my friends have boyfriends, and no matter how many resumes' i hand out, even to shops advertising that they want employees, no one wants me!"
2723,"Help me, Im a suicidal teenager","Ive tried 3 times, and Ive finally thought aobut geting help, i feel lyke everyday just gets even more unbearable, but Im also an in the closet gay, and some of my friends are homophobs, so im even more scared... please help me"
2724,Sharing my experience,"Well some of you may know and some may not, but either way I feel like I should share my experience with suicide on here."
2725,suicidal,hey guys
2726,ways to go,hey
2727,wasnt sure where to put it,"hi, i had an internal monologue in my head the other day, telling me the world was going to end in 10 days, which is tomorrow (tomoz being the 2nd) it told me people were going to descend from the sky and turn the world upside down and walk away. That is a random thing, but the main reason inm posting is because i cant interact with nyone without being annoying or hurting them. I did a very stupid thing last night when i was drunk. I regret it so much, and it also hurt one of my best friends feelings who likes this guy."
2728,this really helped me,"some of you may not be catholic, but, this prayer has helped me and i do believe it works. it is a novena for an impossible request. many of you may feel life is not worth living, but, there is always a little bit of hope no matter how incredibly small it may be (and i am talking small). please don't give up even if it gets unberable. here is a link to the website that has the prayer on it."
2731,"I do not want to commit suicide, but ...","I'm 17 and feel myself slipping back into depression which lead to my referral to a psychiatrist in April/May time. I finally opened up and discussed how Id always felt different and alienated, I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, which went some way to explain why I always was a strange child with many oddities my mother could never fathom."
2732,My Time's Up...,"The dreaded moment I was painfully trying to avoid came; my parents no longer want me to live with them and with no money at hand, I have to live on streets. A homeless, a bum, a nobody. I have no choice to end my life pretty soon as I can't and wouldn't let myself go through this sh|t. So many things I wanted to do in my life, so many places to see but alas some people weren't meant to last and my time has come. I don't need anybody's support, frankly I can't afford it. All I want to say is that don't torment your children psychologically and emotionally. Maybe they are not srong enough to hack their way through life. Maybe they can't deal with people the way you expected them. Maybe they are not emotionally equipped to deal with the hardship of life. I'm gone but at least for those of you who will have kids, don't treat them like a dirt, don't condescend them to the point where there wouldn't be no self-esteem left in them to go through life. And worst of all I'm still scared; scared of death but I've no choice to go through with it and embrace it as a final solution to end my misery. I wish these soul-crushing feelings upon no one."
2733,Possible Suicide any day now..,"Ok im really stressed now. There is this person some click away so i cant help physically, anyway last few days she has beeen talking about suicide, and well shes finally saying that shes going to do it. i have tried my best, even getting my mate to help to no avail. She was ment ot be doing it today, but i managed to convince her one more day."
2734,Possible Suicide,"My sister always seems so much in control. Always arguing with me and winning every argument against me simply because I don't like confrontations. I even attribute my passive, shy and low self-esteem to my sister's (and my mother's) manipulative, controlling and argumentitive personalities. My mother and my sister are extremely bright people, they can tell you are lying long before you finish speaking."
2735,prayer,"Does anyone on here believe in God? I need you to pray for me, and mean it. I know God will only listen to those close to him, which I am not. I need someone to pray for me who is close to God so that he can hear my prayer. Please. Just pray that I can survive long enough to get away from here. I just need a few more years, and I don't know if I can go on because things are so hard, they are just so hard. I'm so tired. I just need a break from everything I am living with."
2736,This is the end...,"I had a melt down tonight, as always once I started crying I just couldnt stop. I want to stop and regain my compsure so bad, but I cant?"
2737,"pleace read it, i have much to say","hello, my name is alice, and today i go to my good friend's funeral..."
2738,Slipping back again,I have to live up to alot of expectations from my family. I hate them for it. I suffer from servere depression. I cut. There was a while ago when i was suicidal. Ive started to slip back down that way. I really cant say anything to my parents though. I cant just admit myself to a mental hospital either because they would visit and been ashamed that i didnt carry on with my further eduction and job. It's too much stress. Ive been so down that i started to do solvents. Ive also been cutting much deeper. I kinda want to talk to someone but i cant bring myself to. Im afraid. My friends wont help me out either. Is there any way that i could go somewhere and get help without my parents finding out?
2739,too much,"I had a plan. Outlined one hundred percent on how I was going to do it when the time came. It was my comfort, knowing that I could get out, knowing that I had this plan of suicide. It was on paper, three pages, and on it had outlined suicide notes, for my mom, dad and brothers and two friends of mine. About a week ago, I burned it. And haven't had anything to hold onto since. I cut, a lot and have for the past four years and in the past week have cut every day, which is something I haven't done in three years."
2740,no title,I can't feel anything. It's gotten worse and worse and now all I can feel if I feel anything at all is pain. so I really prefer not feeling anything at all which is what it has been 99% of the time anyway.
2741,depression on and off,"Over the past year or so, i've been seemingly going through these cycles, some weeks im fine others really down, cutting my arm, thinking about suicide. there doesn't seem to be any common trigger or anything like that. Was hoping someone could give me advice as i dont want to head into anti-depressents and that when 2/3 of the time im fine, but has anyone else experienced something like this?"
2742,a day in the life,"When I wake up in the morning, I usually think about how when I shoot myself, it will be behind my right ear with either a high-caliber handgun or a short-barrel pistol grip shotgun. I will buy a watermelon or 2 for testing. I think about how I will not leave a note since I will never be satisfied that it has explained anything. Other times, I think about writing a sentence or two. I will do it somewhere away from home, away from everybody."
2743,Hopeless,"i just don't think i can keep holding on, trying to make things better anymore. because nothing i've done has worked. it doesn't matter if i'm in a relationship, have lots of friends or just a few, love my job or hate it, spend time by myself or with people i care about.. write out how i feel, or keep it to myself. it doen't matter how logically i think things through. nothing seems good or fun. the first thing i think about in the morning is killing myself, the first emotion i feel is just so much hurt. i've been skipping all my university classes because i can't bare the thought of going anywhere. i've been skipping work because i don't want my boss (who is my friend) to see how depressed i am.. i want to quit school, stop giving myself any sort of excuse to keep trying and looking for reasons to live. i won't go to the doctor. why not, you ask? what do i have to lose? whatever self respect i have left."
2744,Experiencing big problems....,Hi all. Sorry if this is a bit long.
2745,Need some suggestions...,"I haven't been feeling very good for a few years....I'm at a very low point now... I have absolutely no friends to talk to (actually, no friends at all), I can't afford to have talk therapy/medication for depression, I can't talk to my parents, so asking them for help is impossible."
2746,help me save someone's life,I went to a party the other night and there was lots of people there dancing and having fun. This girl in my science class is pretty cool came up and started dancing with me. I think she likes me a lot. She trys to get my attention way too much. She's also a big druggy who is suicidal. I am pretty much a good boy. I don't do drugs or have sex or stuff like that...but knowing that she has tried to and might try to kill herself later disturbs me and makes me sick. I tried talking with her delicately. She smokes and says it'll knock years off her life...I try to reason and say things that wouldn't provoke her to even think about stuff like that. She also has had theory before. I dont want to recomend anything cause I know she'll refuse. Overall I need help without making a mistake. I really care for her as a friend and I don't want her to kill herself.
2747,How Many Times Do You Think About Suicide? [Poll],I'd like to know:
2748,My own experience...,"Only a few people know about this, two close friends and now you."
2749,The Dead End. Looking for a way...,"For some reasons, I have lost my will to live, to survive. I know I cannot continue like this, that I cannot continue to drag myself through everyday. Either I find a way out or I end it."
2750,Help need to get through this,"ok, im in year 12, and im doing my VCE which is the Victorian Certificate of Education.... its like the HSC or something.... anyway, in feb this year, my grandfather died suddenly, i was called out of school one afternoon and the next morning my mother woke me up telling me he had died. it devistated me for a long time, and caused great problems at school with friends, as i just didnt have interests in being around them. during this time, my last remaining grandparent was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and was given 3 months to live, also my father lost his job. so as u can guess i went through a lot of emotions, while trying to do my best for yr 12. my friends pretty much left me, and told me that if i ever have problems just dont tell anyone... now i know i posted a letter before saying james my best mate is the nicest guy and has always been there for me, well at this point of time, he wasnt... anyway, the thing is i lost motivation to do homework, i lost motivation to see friends, to make an effort to look nice when going down the street, to get out of bed or anything, ive been to the doctors they say i dont have depression, so its not that... but anyway, i need help to get me back on track before i competely ruin my life by not doing well with my vce... its important that i do well as my parents have spent over $50,000 for my education... i have to do well... there is no question about it... please help me be motivated... help me make it through the year, i had thoughts of killing myself, they were that bad, that after making attempts of my life and still waking up i felt like s*** i couldnt believe that i was alive and i still wanted to die."
2751,"Tired of holding on,..Im hanging onto a thin piece of thread","i want to go, Tired of living, tired of people. Ive given up on myself. I see a councellor, but its not helping,.. I took an overdose 3 weeks before my birthday in february, but the damned pills didnt work, thats Y im still here. Wish i could just blnk out forvever. Im tired ofl iviong, tired of reality. I ve shut myself out from al my feelings, im scared of wat i will find if i decide to look inside myself. I hate myself, I hate my reality,. I hate life, living,.. EVRYTHING!!... Im so numb,. Im just a walking talkin zombie.."
2752,I can't go on...,I just don't think I have it in me anymore to live on. I have been dreading this day for the last 2 years but I'm afraid my life is about to come to the crashing end. I can't control my tears; I am nobody in life and my heart bleeds. I don't want to die but I just don't see how I can get myself out of this quagmire of agony.
2753,What if you truly are at the end of your rope?,"Let's say everyone who matters (close friends, spouse/long time companion) has betrayed you or always treated you like you weren't important, you have no job or career, no friends at all because they always end up backstabbing or betraying you when you, no future at all, health is completely detriorated, anything you might enjoy gets taken away from you (like sports due to severe injuries), when is enough enough?"
2754,"in college, great friends/family...but i'm scared again","I'm in college Now. and i like it here. I'm away from some of my previous troubles (family life), but now i'm back here again."
2755,Hurting the people around you,"I have heard people talk about how if you choose to die, that it hurts all of the people who around you who care like family and friends. What if those exact people (every single one of them) were the cruel ones to you your whole life? And now you just don't find joy in anything? What should their feelings be any concern to you? I know they aren't for me."
2756,So why don't we do it?,"Suicide is something a lot of people have wanted to do, attempted to do and in some cases, succeeded at. i know this because i've read a lot of people's posts and can sympathise. its something i think about a lot. i kinda go thru phases where sometimes i dont think of it at all, and sometimes its so consuming that it nearly drives me to attempt... but i never do."
2757,To Tired to even try anymore,"I'm to tired to even try anymore my mother just says that I need to pull myself up but I can't. I don't have any strenth left. I can bearly go to school, I don't want to work or anything. I just want to die. I pretty much have nothing left my boyfriend rather ignore me than try to help. My mother refuses to help me and everyone else just doesn't understand me."
2758,Its all over. Im done.,"I have been battling depression for a while now. I have had treatment and help for many things, but I just cant see a point. I feel as if a great painful sorrow lives inside of me. It actually hurts all the time. I cant see any future for me, I have no dreams, no desires."
2759,It's only a matter of time.,"Well.... I don't know anymore... The thing is, these past few weeks... months have been hard.... And I feel so worthless. I know I sound like a broken record moaning about life."
2760,wow,REINCARNATION:
2761,"bullied by police, paramedics, and fire","Hi,"
2762,im sinking.,im stronger than that!
2763,Indecisiveness/self-contradiction,"When I'm living alone, I'm depressed because I want desperately to be around people all the time."
2764,Just wanted to say goodbye,Thankyou to everyone who helped me with my problems and I hope everyone on this site has the strength I don't have.
2765,Life sucks....,"I thought I'd be happier,skinnie, prettier, more fun by now. Im almost 20 now and my life is just slipping by. I can help but think I should die. Ive been dealing with this since I was 16. I never imagined that I'd be such a loser. I have no friends, Im just ugly, and I wear terrible clothes. I cant even get a decent guy to pay me any type of attention b/c I am worthless. I wish I were better looking. I hate going outside. I hate looking in the mirror. Im just ready to end this. I ready for it all to be over. I just live in constant pain and depression. Life sucks. Im not saying it should be perfect. But the days just run into eachother. Nothing even remotely good ever happens. Im always waiting and looking and trying to find some way to change but it never seems to work. I dont know what to do anymore. Im in college and Im honestly just tired of going. I do my work I get through my classes but its becoming incresingly difficult to get out of bed in the morning. I have nothing to look forward to. I dont have a major, I dont have career goals. Im beginning to think I have no talent. I dont know what Im here for. Im tired of it all...I want to be happier and appreciate what I have but I dont know how."
2766,Dont want to live anymore....,"I've come to the conclusion that my life has been a pointless, meaningless series of events, strung together only for the sheer entertainment of others to laugh at me and watch me fall. I don't want to do this anymore. I'm tired of living. I'm tired of people telling me that's how life is, how its unfair and I just need to suck it up and deal with it. Everyone around me seems so harsh, their words like acid to my skin. All they're interested about is telling me to deal with it. They don't care about my pain. They don't care about me. I don't know the point of this post. But that shouldn't be surprising since there really isn't any point to my life anyhow..."
2767,Im tired of this.,"Im tired of all this crap in my life, ive had enough of it all and i have no way out."
2768,i dont know why,"tonight i was sitting at home and all of a sudden i got really suicidal, not depressed, i was fine emotionally, i just was about to kill myself. nothing was bothering me i just got up and went and got some cleaning chemicals and made a suicide drink, it was like i couldnt control my body, obviously i didnt drink it but i was about to and i dont know why does anyone have any advice?please im confused and worried"
2769,Ruined my life. No turning back,"I'v always been know as the happy, wild chic. That title hasn't left me until this year when i got involved with drugs. Since then i have been diagnosed with anxioty, ADD, social anxioty and other things i haven't ever heard of."
2770,3rd time unlucky,hi am a n00b here but what ive read so far was interesting
2771,I think it is time for me to write a goodbye note,I have been here before and see everything is caving in. Well it is. I am have tried to keep a positive outlook and it is not happening. I am at a critical stage with financial that I don;t know what to do.
2772,no reason to live,"I want to kill myself, I have no one here. Sure i have friends and family but they are all far away. I have NO ONE here for me right now, no one to give me a hug when i need one. I tried to turn to my only friend here and he told me he was sick of all my emotional distress and it was stressing him out and he really didn't care if i live or die. After all I've helped him out thats what he tells me. that was my only friend i had here in this city. now, i just want to die. My life is going absolutely nowhere right now, i can't find a job, i dont' have a boyfriend or any friends here. Seriously there is no reason to live. i tried to strangle myself with ap hone cord and almost passed out. I'm ready to take things to a more serious level. I think i finally have the strength to end my life. I really Don't want to do it, but i have nothing to live for anymore. I'm tired of things going no where, and of having no one here that understands how I feel right now."
2773,Okay....Now what?,"I'm alright I guess wanting to die though, eveything seems to be my fault. I know I've given alot of advice and some of it hasn't been to good I only hope that I haven't killed anyone. I'm here because I can't sleep. I've been trying but I just can't. My mother was taken to the hospital not to long ago because she passed out three times in a row. Still not sure what's wrong. I just don't know how much longer I'm going to last."
2774,I have had it,"I know how corny this sounds, but i have had such a bad time over the last few years. I have tried so hard to get on with my life, but i have been completely abandoned by everyone. Its so lonely for me."
2775,"no reason left, why not now","I decided a while ago that i would kill myself, in a day or ten years i wanted to die on my own terms.Lately Im thinking its going to be much sooner than i thought.I cut tonight for the first time in 8(?) months i think,worse than i ever have before, well not counting past suicide attempts.Work today stressed me out to the point i was throwing up and crying when i got home. Recently I've been waking up in tears because i dream of people who i love whos lives ive ruined with my existence. The more i think about my life the more I notice I am nothing btu a burden to anyone I love and care about.The one person I still care about is I dont even know how far away. I dont know what to do, Ive lost everything that keeps me living . any advice?"
2776,How can I find out what happened?,"I have this one friend whom I met online. We are both depressed, and that's sort of how we became friends. She sometimes goes through very serious periods of depression. I have not heard from her in over a month. I'm worried she might have done something to herself."
2777,will somebody please talk to me....,"i'm really having a hard time... i don't really even want to live cuz i don't feel like i have anything to live for. my mom is the type she won't let me have ""any friends"" or ""any girl"" that i want, they have to have that big stamp on them that says ""mom approved"" you know what i mean?"
2778,So why go on...,"Well, I have a list of reasons to keep going through life. My car, my parents, my family, to work, to make money, to own crap. Now lets weed that down to the important ones, my parents, my family, and my car...just joking."

2780,for a friend,"To make it clear now, I am not contemplating suicide, that is not the intent of my post."
2781,Feel like crap,"this isn't the first time, and its pretty typical"
2782,I just don't know anymore.,"almost over a year, I have been majorily depressed, I have attempted suicide many times before. Then I thought I was doing so much better feeling great, but then again things happened in my life that I wonder if there is any good in this world. I keep trying to force myself to be happy and forget about everything, but I just can't. Everyday I hardly to get out of bed in fear of what the day will be like. I don't want to take my life though, but I don't want to live the way I do."
2783,about to self destruct,"I just feel like total crap right now and I need a place to talk and vent. It seems like my entire life has been a complete waste of time. Just when I think things in my life are starting to look up, everything that I look forward to is taken away. I'm always depressed. People always come up to me and say, ""why do you look so sad for?"" and I just pause for a moment not knowing where to begin, but I always end up telling them, ""I'm fine"" just so I won't be hastled. And it's true I have a permenant frown on my face, even when I seem to be happy it's there. I don't have any friends to talk to. When I try to make new ones I scare them away or they move or something. I've always been so alone in this world, thinking there's got to be someone here I can talk to. But there's not. Just myself and I'm going crazy. What's wrong with me? I have no purpose in life. If things don't change I don't want to be here. Words can't even described what I feel inside right now. I'd rather die than feel this way."
2784,SUICIDE.....,"last night, i took a giant step, and told my mum that I've had suicidal thoughts. we had a long discussion, and i red her my journal where I had talked about killing my self, and how I felt about it… she cried, and I cried, but she told me that she always feared that I would have those thoughts, she didn't know why, but she had a feeling because of things that I have gone through, that I would have them. But anyway, she told me shes going to get me some help, and that shes going to be with me the whole way. I wanted to tell you guys, because I know there are a lot of people in the same situation as me, and I want them to know that they can get through it."
2785,Saden And I Need Help,I so sad cause the guy I love so much hate me and I want to comittee sucide but I know that all the pain will stil be there in my afterlife right now I'm in a sill quiet move where I'm just not takling to any one cause I'm hurt and saden by the curelty of people
2786,Has Anyone Here NEVER thought about commiting suicide?,"I have heard that most people, at some time in thier life, consider suicide. So I was wondering how many people here can honestly say that they have NEVER thought about committing suicide? Is there anyone here who can say that they have NEVER thought about committing suicide?"
2787,This is just to Inform those that don't seem to know,"Suicide, isn't about weakness or strenth. It's about pain. Mental and sometimes physical pain that is so sevear that someone can not cope with it. This pain could have many sources, a break up, devorice, death of a loved one, stress from tests in school, job stress, and just genral stress in life or a number of other things."
2788,IM SORRY I CANT BE PERFECT!!..Im fading into my shadow,"IM not good enough, smart enough, pretty enough, funny enough, sexy,. i dnt turn heads, guys don't look at me twice, I dont get good enough grades,. My artwork is never ""up to stanadard"",. I ""never do anything right"",. I useless,. Lazy, Fat, Sppotty, Chunky,. I dont make guys laugh, IM not charming,. My clothes arnt sexy enough,I dont have a sexy body,. My accent isn't ""proper"".."
2789,The Law and Suicide,Could someone please tell me what the law is on suicide and if it is the same in the U.K?
2790,im wondering if i should kill my self rite now,im 16 yrs old and i just hate who i am i just hate being me!
2791,Right to die...,"Here I am, sitting alone as usual, waiting for the miracle of a quick death to release my pining soul."
2792,Had a revelation tonight...,"After breaking up with my ex-gf and getting convinced, by her, that she does not want me around, I noticed something, I'm alone."
2793,suicide-- kinda,"for a while now, i've been thinking about suicide on a daily basis."
2794,My friend want me dead,The other day my friend told me that she would rather that i got cancer than continue to be how i am. I dont even know why. I leave her alone. I dont even talk to her bout my problems anymore. She was my best and only friend. She said she would always be there. No what? its obvious no1 wants me.
2795,Sucidal/Depressed Friend.... with an odd twist....,"Ok I've had thsi friend who has alway s been a bit ""depressive... sometimes talking about wanting to die etc. I, though, not living anymore where he lives, have done my best as the long distance friend, staying up late to im-chat with him He was always a bit anti-social, so this never made things better."
2796,dont read,I hate my life and can't keep breathing...I'm one of those
2797,I tried it - again...,"Here in Latvia the whole country celebrates the summer solstice, so as usual I went to a festival in my home town... But somehow this year's summer solstice became so cruel to me - I realized that I had no friends to hang out with, all of them have girlfriends, in the festival, everyone had their friends & loved ones beside... And I was just looking at all these crowds - ALONE..."
2799,What do you do when you get lonely,"Let's skip the I won't do it stuff. I'm 21 y.o. and with 16 I was alreadx an alcoholic and never tryed to quit. I have problems in family and just I had to tell someone so I tell it here. There is nothing to be done. It's not a crime to take my own life aaway it has been taken a long time ago. It was just a matter of time. The pressure is too much and life so short. I believed in god but I'll never do a same mistake again. Life is so easy to some people but to me and other like me nothing but box witch you throw away with time. Here is a question, is life precious thing or nothing? Maybe we will taype to ich other in some other life. :scramble:"
2800,Heaven or hell question?,What do people believe happens to the soul after someone commits suicide? Do you believe you are forgiven or are you condemmed to hell?
2801,Please,"Why do so many people have all the things they want, cars, clothes, tvs, food, a roofs over their heads, a family, health...how can so many people have everything and take it for granted?"
2802,What reasons do i have to live?,"I don't know why i'm writing this since i can't believe anoyone will find a miracle solution for me, besides the usual advices about how a great thing life is (although i really admire the people who tries to help others); I just want to write about how i'm feeling, a raw display of emotions and thoughts without care or beauty."
2803,I don't think I should be here...,"okay, here's the deal. i have died 2 times already. the first time i slit my wrists and lost a lot of blood and had to be revived. the second time i was deep in meditation and i slowed my breathing down so much that i eventually stopped and my heart stopped too. it was like falling asleep but never waking up... then i was revived by my teacher who thought i had been strangled or something."
2804,Really worried,I've been talking on msn pretty much all days with a friend that is depressed lately due to some issues in her relationship. today she sounded really down and i tried to make her feel better.
2805,k,kfghsdf
2807,Anger always getting the best of me,"I didn't know where else to go to talk about this, I just happen to come accross this forum. I hope this is the right place to put this. My whole life I've had anger problems, seems like the older I get the more intense it gets. I use to attend counseling, but that didn't help any. I get so mad I don't know what I'm doing or have control over it. I try to hide it as best I can when I'm around people cause I don't want them to see me like that. But then it feels like I'm going to explode and I'll take it out on myself...usually by cutting my arm or punching a wall/door. I can't take it anymore, I wish I could end it, but it seems the only way would be through killing myself. Here lately I've tried hanging myself, but it failed. I don't want to end my life, but I don't have control alot of times. Maybe someone could help me find another way to get through this cause I can't seem to"
2808,wut do i do?,my ex boyfriend is acting really weird since i dumped him. he talks about suicide but says he wouldnt do it. he acts like hes actually
2809,Notice,"When someone is thinking of suicide they do not need to hear. Act your age or that's a stupid thing to kill your self over, or anything else relating to that."
2810,"long post. Im gonna kill myself , so NM the replys.",I have been living with my grandparents for about a year now because I can not live with my mom cause my step dad is sexually and physically abusiv and she would rather toss me then make him leave.
2811,"I pushed people away, and now I am alone","I am about to go through a time in my life where I am to be COMPLETELY alone, with the exception of my two cats. This is really hard for me."
2812,Feeling depressed,"Okay I feel really bad for doing this, but I don't know what else to do. Here goes:"
2813,I need a Friend....,I just don't know anymore. I'm sick of everything. I hate the way my life has turned out. All I do at the moment is think up different ways of ending my life. I am scared to die but the life I lead is worse. I have no life.
2814,4 years,"Well where do I begin, I am 22 and when I was 16 I got my first real girlfriend, we were young and silly together it was a good time, the best time. Well after 2-3 years things got tired and I broke it off, I thought at the time it was the best thing for both of us as we were both beginning university. Anyway within a week I missed her alot so I thought mabye her feeling the same would get me another shot. I was wrong, she had already hooked up with some guy from her work and I was dropped altogether. I went through a phase of constantly emailing her begging to get her back and even bumped into her once on a bus when I proceeded to journey with her all the way to her workplace where we agreed to be friends (this for me was just a way to get back in to the fold). Anywayher promise of friendship was never manifested and she basically made it clear I was not wanted anymore. This killed me at the time a huge pain was born and I wanted to die. Anyway I had some steady friends and I managed to soldier on applying a mask of sanity. We've not spoke for 4 years unti last week when she suddenly felt guilty for still talking to her new ex (the guy she left me for) and not speaking to me so now we're firends? I played it cool for 6 days then e-mailed her suggesting a quiet drink to catch up and she still hasn't replied meaning she wont. I also found out today that after her last breakup she had some sort of one night stand and this was a new killer blow, the climax of the tragic movie where she runs back to me after seeing how bad things are without me didn't happen. She done the right thing and evolved into a notch on a bedpost. None of this would be a problem were it not for the constant numb pain and the ill feeling everytime I see or hear from her. I still live with my parents but I now see three options. End the pain using the most definite methods, leaving the country or........no make that two options. My only question is, is 4 years a natural term of breakup pain? I expected to have moved on long ago yet I still pine and think of her everyday. I would appreciate opinions."
2815,Don't know what to do...,Hi
2816,need help,"i feel suicidal, well at the moment i feel drunk. i would go to a doctor and say so but it would really change my life. well, i want that to happen. i spose its just my parents. i feel like running away. i want to be treated but i dnt want my parents to know i want to kill myself. help????????"
2817,"interesting, can help","this is an article about helping people online considering suicide, please give it a read if you will. it is basically saying how the person's ISP can be contacted to reach the person."
2818,Dishonoured. Mathematical Suicide or Homicide?,This contains so many thematics. They all lead to one conclusion: a mathematically unavoidable suicide. But right... I've got also bad in math...
2819,here it is!,i feel so bad for thinking about this. i don't want to live any longer but i can't hurt people. yeah people might be thinking oh darn a 16 year old girl who has people who love her might commit suicide. darn what a hard life she has someone there for her. when most people don't have anyone. well i've never year thought about suicide before until this year. this year hmmm well i just think that i will and everyone else will be better off if i were gone. oh and yes i know people will say what about the people who love you. well everyone says do something for yourself this is the one thing that will be best for me i think. i started cutting last year on my b-day. and my parents found out this year and its like they don't care how it makes me feel. all my mom can say is how do you think we feel stop thinking about yourself. i'm in councling and on meds but oh guess what just like they said the suicidal thoughts started showing up. i have no clue what i'm going to do. i think i just needed to vent who knows.
2820,"long post, but I really need help, Please help.","Well I don't know where to start. There are so many different things wrong with me and I don't know how to fix any of them. I have totally given up changing, cause I can't seem to change. I am so messed up I can't even think about it. I guess I'll do the easiest thing possible and just make a list of my problems."
2821,I've run out of choices,Okay well im close to really thinkin about doin it now my lfie is on a complete low.. i cant talk to ANYONE about my feelings because im too scared and I really cant this is my only choice... I ahve nothin god to lvoe for nothin.. every day is torture for me... I hate my life so much
2822,it doesn't matter what i say but....,"my feelings toward suicide has been a tug of war as of late. but the one thing that makes me feel like ending my life is the way things are for me socially. i'm just not good at opening up and fitting in....but that doesn't mean i don't bloody try. it is frustating when all you want is for someone to notice you...and they overlook you like you don't matter. someone came into this office i was in and i tried to say hi, but she just acted as if i wasn't there. she chatted with soem other people in the office which didn't bother me but as she left she said something about keeping soemthing a secret...and that it wasn't a big deal to say it out loud in the office because n one was in there. well i was....and while i know i socially suck at fitting in, i'm a human bloody human being just like her. i don't know if she's being mean on purpose, but i hate how i'm not even worth a hello."
2823,can't take it anymore!!,"I've been working 2 and half jobs which I like a lot, so far in the last few weeks I've been getting yelled at at both jobs, I get stressed and yell at my friends..I cut myself because I just wanna find love and every girl that I talk to that I like screws me over. I more or less have everything that I want, I just want love. I want to feel appreciated by people at work, and I wanted to be appreciated by women too. I just wanna end it."
2824,just a reminder,"hey all,"
2825,My hair is thinning and I'm only 20 years old,I think I want to kill myself now. Lost my gf and my hairs getting thin and I'm this young! No girl will want me now and not even my ex would come back if my hair does not stop thining. I've tried this new product but It doesnt seem to be helping. Killing myself every year seems like a good option. At least I'll accomplish something great by doing so...
2826,completely worthless,i cant seem to do anything for myself anymore. i can't make little simple decisions without freaking out or crying.
2827,sick of livin' a poem on my suicidal life,the pain of death and dying
2828,continuing my two month plan,i'm sorry to keep making new posts about this but today was the last time i will see the girl that runs the bible study at school. last week i was really upset and made the mistake of revelaing my two month suicide plan (not the whole thing) she wanted to help me as much as she could but today i told her to forget about me and to forget what i said. i really wanted to tell her more...i wanted to tell her why i no longer wanted to seek counseling and at the core of why i feel hopeless is because important things in my life no longer matter. should i try to call her and tell her or would this be a waste of her time....a further waste mind you.
2829,Not to many options,I don't know why I am writing. I guess it is because there is a small part of me that doesn't want to do what I am going to do.
2830,SUICIDAL TENDENCIES,"SUICIDE IS NOT THE ANSWER, PEOPLE!! Please, I beg you... I've been there... tried it. There's a GOOD REASON WHY I WASN'T SUCCESSFUL IN MY ATTEMPTS AT SUICIDE... Please visit my website by clicking on my profile. You will find all the help you need. It's only a NAME away. Plus, if you'd like to talk, you can feel free to e-mail me. You'll get my e-mail off of my web site. PLEASE DON'T MAKE AN ETERNAL MISTAKE!!!"
2831,i despise myself,"over the past couple of weeks, after a 8 years of on-off depression/OCD/anorexia, ive had a few moments where ive come very close to suicide. essentially it comes down to issues i have with relationships (i find them stifling or i mess them up), the issues ive always had with self esteem , paranoia, body loathing, etc as well as being very prone to depression. my parents dont *do* mental illness."
2832,Not so long to go...,"Okay, I have just found this forum few weeks ago, and just felt telling about up- and downhills of my life. This is not only about suicide, so I hope forum is a right one.."
2833,friend of mine always wanting to die..please help,"my female friend, has always told me that sometimes she wants to kill her self, and doesnt see any reason to live. She says sometimes she feels as if part of her body gives out, or her boyfriend sometimes wants to have time alone, and the only person she can talk to is me. She is a very attractive female, but yet she says she always feel over weight and ugly...it hurts me like hell that she is pushing her self to these limits. I would do anything for her. If anyone can give me any advice, to cheer her up and to lessen her ideals to commit suicide..and to not be so depressed all the time, it would be much appreciated, this girl has so much potential and such a great personality to just let go to waste.."
2834,Down in the dumps....again.,"Once again im seeing symptoms of depression and suicide in my life,it's like a fly on the wall that just wont go away.You want to kill it but its just out of your reach,thats how I feel right now.I'm feeling pretty helpless when it comes to life in general,im not a ""normal"" person i dont think like everyone else does I like think outside the box so to say."
2835,"Everything is caving in on me, when will it stop","I just feel everything is caving in for the past 2 months. I hate my job and they are screwing me around and trying to force me out of the door, it is hitting me more financially and then the relationship with the girl I work with. It is the triple effect and I cannot stand it anymore."
2836,"friend thinks she has no friends, and boredom overwhelms","I know alot of people say this, but she says no one loves her..and shes constantly being blown by everyone not wanting to ever talk because they also have their *own* problems, which means their ""working"", but the only person she can really talk to is me. I have no idea what to say when she says these things. Im not the best person a bringing up conversations. No idea what to do, stuck in a loop..hurts me to see her like this."
2837,I can't find a reason to be here.,"I dont know how to start this,"
2838,I'm gone...,"I'm not sure if anyone will really care, but it's my time to go... I just came to this sight and saw that I could post this and I am...I don't think theres anything for me out there anymore and I should just go with out hurting anyone...Who would even care so whats the fricken point... None of you care, my friends probably won't , who will?... The anwser is no one.I feel like it's my time and I need to go. Every day is just another day of carelessness. Being depressed and just being sad... I can't stand being here any more so, this is the best option, to kill my self.. Maybe I'll be happier dead... The day's of crawling out of my bed every morning is not worth the effort.. And it's just time for the final goodbye to the world.. Maybe one day people will realize why I did it.. because there isn't one thing good for me, and theres nothing worth my fricken while to live for so... as I said before I shall say my final goodbye."
2839,It's over...,"I hope it is okay to post this here. I don't know anyone on this site, but I just want this simple space for my last thoughts. This isn't a post about all my problems or anything like that...it's just a simple goodbye to the people who love me. Something solid, that they will maybe find one day and understand why I did this. I love you... I will see you in the next life. The pain is too much to bare...I tried to be strong, but it just faded away. Take care. xxx."
2840,I care too much.,"so why is it that every second of the past two days has been devoted to one of my friends? maybe the fact that i STILL haven't heard from her. the only things that i have been hearing is from the one person that was on the phone with her a few minutes after she slit her wrists. she is in the hospital is what i am told. i want to talk to her so bad. i want to know that she is ok. i have known her for 7 years of my life, of course some of the time was spent not talking to her (what can i say? its called being in middle school) but the past two years i have gotten close to her. i want to call her. but i KNOW she isn't home. she isn't online and that just reinfoces the story that i am hearing from this girl. i don't want to call and her mother yell at me. i just realized that i have her cell but its too late for me to call. i dont know how much longer i can last without knowing if she is ok. i don't want to lose her. she may not be my closest friend, but she is a hell of a lot more easier to talk to then my Best friend so you have to understand that she still is important in my life. she makes me laugh. and im scared. im scared that i will lose her. i could be freaking out for nothing. once again. thats me. worry worry worry. and the worst part about it is that its about 4 of us at school that know why she isn't there. we don't want rumors to spread considering that 90% of the school hates her and the other 9% doesn't care but the 1% consists of me and like 2 other people. it's a hell of a bday present... thats for sure. but i can't think about me at the moment."
2841,Why does anyone care?,"I'm seriously pissed at people who all the sudden give a care about me when I'm depressed and suicidal, its hypocritical and makes me want to leave this fake world more than stay. I hate hypocrites. I hate my ""friends."" I hate my life."
2842,Suicide: Is it the only way out?,I've had a couple of personal experiences with regards to people taking their own lives and I have considered doing it myself. I just wanted to share my experiences with the rest of this board and offer a little advice from my own personal experience.
2843,im lost,i am so confused i dont even know where to start mabye i shouldent mabye i should just end it all
2844,stressed out with everything,i try so hard to me be.... i want to be who i am and be accepted for who i am not for who i am not..... high school is just one big popularity contest and its stupid on how we percieve eachother....
2845,wow guys,"i jsut wanted to note that im not feeling my best. im a guy who isnt very manly. i dont know how to. my attempts keep failing. im just so tired of myself. i dont like who i see in the mirror. i wish i knew if there were really a God waiting on the other end to hurl me into hell for killing myself. otherwise, i will be lying peacfully at the bottom of the ocean. dont have to reply, im not killing myself anytime soon. just airing my pain. i cry at night. i wish i knew for sure if there is a God out there waiting to hurl me into hell. i just hate myself for my inability to pull myself together. im not killing myself, i just would if i knew the finality of the after life. until then, i will cry at night, and walk tough at day . cute."
2846,I am thinking of taking my life,I cant seem to get my life to work at all
2847,I'm that one guy....,"Hello people,"
2848,dealing with a death of a friend,my best friend Tony killed himsself in January of 2005..... 7 days after my B-Day.... anyway... its been awhile since then and yet i still miss him teribly...
2849,Wants to end all problems.. life is worse than I think! Help,Hi..!
2850,I should fade. Away from the pain..,
2851,i just need to talk,"please PM me if you are willing to help. i'min a slum, and i just need to talk to someone who won't judge me, or tell me i'm wrong."
2852,my day has already come,"the other day i posted on here for poeple to talk to me privately and help me out, i did that because i had no time to stay here and explain..."
2853,Im scared of what I will do....,"I have recently gone through a break up in my life, and that in itself has managed to change the complete direction in which my life was heading.."
2854,Everything seems too wrong...,I'm so confussed. I feel so alone in the world.. but when somebody tries to tell me I'm not alone and that other people are going through this I get mad... I just can't stop these horrible feelings... and I feel too afraid to end my life... and I can't see a future for myself and it's hard and I feel like nobody understands me and nobody cares. I'm loosing my soul and life seems to bleak to go on.. I need a cheer up...
2855,Just existing is not enough...,"It's not enough for me to just exist, as there seems no point to it. If I am a bag of self replicating proteins who's sole purpose is too simply grow, mature, replicate then why should I not go out into the world now rape as many women as I can before being cornered by the authorities and then kill myself? I'd pick those women who I'd have researched to be morally against abortion and simply play the numbers game on how many will keep the child in accordance with their values and beliefs."
2856,so....,"okay so here's the thing...i've decided to give myself two months before i try to kill myself. in these ttwo months i will do my best to find a better way through this. however during these months, i also am going to try to make sure i leave nothing behind as to not be a burden to those people around me (family i guess) today at work i went to the bathroom and cried and i've had a few other moments where i broke into tears. i'm not going to tell anyone this plan but i want to. yet, i know everyone is gonna give me so much crap for it without really understanding."
2857,My friend wants to die...,I don't know what to do My friend Adam says hes been thinking of taking his life. He called my cell phone I didnt pick up he left a message saying to call him back (which i didnt not knowing why he wanted to talk)
2858,I would NEVER think of killing myself here,"I'm in England right now, on vacation from the states with my dad. I would NEVER think of killing myself here. But the thing is, when i'm actually at home, I think about doing it all the time. It would be so easy. And I can't tell anyone. I have a boyfriend who ''loves'' me and I know he would do anything for me, and I don't want to hurt him. I guess that is the main reason why I stop myself all the time. I am going to see a psychologist for another reason, my mom sent me against my wishes."
2859,my friend needs serious help!!!,"he's being going out with this girl, his first true love, and he loves her with all his heart!!!"
2860,Lost Everything,I am having the most difficult time in life. As a brief overview of my life here it goes.
2861,I don't think I'm ok anymore,"I have been dealing with depression for a couple months now. Last night I woke up around 2am and all I could think about was... ending my life. That was litterly the first thought in my mind and was there for several hours. I have never had such intense self destructive thoughts before. Thankfully Im not that irrational, but its scaring me that Im beginning to think and feel this way. I just am starting to lose hope that anything will get better... there doesnt seem to be a break in the weather. I Just want out and part of me feels that is the only possible way to get rid of these feelings. This is really inconvienent for me because I am now a senior in high school, and I skip school a lot because I feel too depressed to go and I can't stand to be around people. My grades from last semester are not to my potential at all... it seems that everything is going in a spiraling downfall. Im in a pit... Im sinking deeper, I want to find another way out but whats the point of getting out if I Just have to continue living?"
2862,I am really stressed out,Ok lately I have been really stressed out to the point of wanting to die. My mom told me that she wanted to die because I don't live with her. Well in December I will be moving in with her and I don't know how long
2863,I dont kno what to do,I really dont kno what to do bcuz like i feel as tho i have no1 that actully cares about me i mean my mother tells me im not wated and my father is just out of the pictuer and i thought suicide was the best answer and i really dont kno what to do some1 please help me
2864,WHY DID HE HAVE TO GO?¿,Hi everone.
2865,ive got nothing left to prove,"hi, i know you dont care but here it is anyway. all my friends are mad at me at school. all my friends online think i do things for attention and i honestly dont, they are my closest friends and they obviously dont know me at all. i had a fight with my dad it wasnt good, he told me he's gonna take me out of therapy because its not helping. my therapist doesnt care about me anymore, im just another paycheck to him. ive been cutting again...ALOT.i have nothing left to live for, imagine you were in my situation, could you live through this? how? im done here i have nothing left to give nothing else to lose nothing else at all i have nothing left to prove."
2866,so confused,"i promised myself that id never do it ever again but i did, i've just take 47 painkillers with a glass of neat vodka, i feel so scared now, its for the best though i just cant cope wih my life anymore my mum is making it unbearable forever bullying me i feel bad cos i no what im gonna put my dad through but i feel like its gonna be best for me to finish it now, is fairer, no more arguing no tears no shouting shell have what she always wanted me gone she said she regrets having me and she told arlene to never get pregnant as it scrwes your life, i just confused im cant stop crying and i feel ill, makes it worse she is acting like nothing happened im shaking and can barely see through tear so im sorry if this is muddled, i really do love my dad always will just so long as someone no's that ill be k."
2867,Questions about recovering,"Well to make a long story short, I planned to kill myself last june. The date was picked and all, then my parents found out and I chose not to go through with it."
2868,Is he Dead!!!!!!!(cry),"hey people, I'm a little conserned... See i have a very close friend on this site and My computer has been down for a while now so i haven't been able to talk to him and he was mad at me and I just got my computer back up and working today and read his post and It was about suicide and he only posted once on it and that was it, and no one here really talked to him or replyed there were only like 3 relplys on it and He takes things out on himself hard..."
2869,Helping a friend with post-suicide,"I was informed that a close friend attempted suicide. She is calling for me to help her and support her. Of course I will be there for her and not judge her, but other than listening and such I would like to ask for any advice in helping her through this rough time."
2870,THIS CLOSE,I am 14 female + I am this close to finishing it all.
2871,Don't want to go on......,"My wife and step son moved out about a year ago, because she said she couldn't handle my anger and mood swings any longer. I seem to get angry at the drop of a hat about the most trivial things. Since then I have become extremely lonely and isolated. I grew up as an only child and it is very hard for me to socialize with others. My wife keeps telling me that she loves me and will come back if I get a handle on my anger and mood swings, but I don't seem to be able to."
2872,I could die tomorrow.. but how is that different from today?,"I don't understand this anymore. All this mess seems as if it were made for me. I hardly know why I am writing this, perhaps it is to try to make someone care for me, anyone. For when there is no one that listens to your cries, your pleads, there is nothing left to move on or prove. I have nothing, thereforeeee I am, nothing. In this world of violent decay and rancid blood pouring from all our lies, what am I to love or cherish? What am I to believe in? What is there here? I will be dead in 60 or less years, we all will. There is nothing to save us, we are all like the stars, we are alone in the universe, there are others there, we are afraid just floating in our empty vaccuums of time, then we shine so vibrantly, but only before we die. It is a world, and what a world. A world where you can slit your wrists, and carve your skin, only to see the next sunrise. The sun rises red with the blood you have shed upon it, and it hates you. Everyone misses the sun, but you or I will not be missed. Faith is never enough reason to believe everything, or anything will be okay. Nothing in this world ever changes, everyproblem is always replaced with a new decay. Whilst all the while your vacant heart smoulders from the fires of hell you have placed in, within a world, within nothingness. Broken, tattered, shamed. The only reason we are here is to die. The only thing I have is death, so tell me, someone in this forsaken earth, tell me... how can anything be okay again... what is wrong with me... what is happiness... why should I live? For the many hours and days that passes me by, all these deceiving seconds turn into minutes and years, I get older, but as I do I fear I am closer to my end. For who really cares whose stupid life is lost? There is nothing here to miss me. I can kill myself now.. because I'm dead in the eyes of this tainted world."
2873,I want to die..,"The possibility of failure is too much for me; I really don't want to live anymore. I've been deluding myself with grandeur visions of law school, or grad school when it's not going to get any better. I might transfer to a different school, but it won't matter much. I just don't want to try anymore, I don't want to acknowledge failure any further. I don't know if I will be able to do it, but I know I don't want to live anymore. I think I need help, although I don't know who to talk to. No one really understands me. It is a selfish act because my family would be devastated, along with a few friends, but I really don't want to live. Typing this is simply an acknowledgement of my recognition of failure, frustration and feeling of dejection. The only way I will be content with life is if I have a challenging and satisfying job, and by the looks of it, I'm not even sure if I'll make graduation. I just want out. It may be a narrow view, but only if I can turn my life around can I be happy and I'm not sure if I can do that. I've tried in the past and it didn't happen; the probability for future success is just as slim. I want out."
2874,I wanted to curl up in a little ball.,ok. at the moment. i am overwhelmed with so many different feelings that i want to just run. run until my legs give out.
2875,I need advice.,"Ok, so I am in a very sticky situation. But before I begin, I want to keep this as anonymous as possible(I even created a whole new account just incase).... so let me just say:"
2876,"Its okay 2 look at our ""Shadow / Dark"" side-We ALL",From a book I'm reading on the hidden power that lies within our darkside.....and being able to meet our darkside.
2877,How do I help my girlfriend?,"Hi,"
2878,UGh....advice please,ok so i dont know how soon someone can get back to me with some advice...but i need to write on here my ex-boyfriend of like 3 days...just IMED me telling me he needs someone to talk to because he feels like hes going crazy and he is thinking about killing himself...he wants me to come see him..i said no i would either just talk to him on the phone or online...ugh what am i supposed to do....i dont know if he is being serious..or if it is just another way to manipulate me
2879,am i??,ok i have been grounded for a week now when i first got grounded i really thought about suicide.then i got in another fight with my parents and i thought about it again and it scared me alot.am i suicidail? its not the first time i have about it but not in so much detail and ihave barely anything to live for any more like before it was because i had boyfriend but now there is even less.so what do i do i haven't told anyone cuz i dont want anyone to know and i dont want anyone thinking i just want attention.And the other night i took a saftey pin and my knukles r screwed and it helped me alot i guess instead of me cuttin i mess wit my knuckles and if anyone asks what i did i'll just say i got mad and punched the wall and this is waht happened.and i dont cut my wrists cuz i m afaird of cuttin to deep and comitting suicide so what is wrong wit me????
2880,Wondering what's the point of liveing anymore,I'm starting to wonder what the point of me liveing is honestly. Everyone I count on isn't there when I need them or leaves me. I can't deal with it anymore.
2881,Committing suicide bc of wanting to die young??,"I deal with depression, and am a recovering self-injurer. I don't trust people or put myself in a position where I'm going to get hurt. But even if I become totally happy, marry some great amazing person. Have a wonderful life and enjoy every day, every minute, growing older still doesn't appeal to me. What I'm saying is that I don't think I will commit suicide out of pain and sadness...I think it will be because I am done living, I don't want to grow up."
2882,scared,"i'm here because i'm scared.nobody knows me so i can write everythig that passes my mind.first a short feedback,so you can understand what i'm talking about..sute if you cand because most of the times i have to ideea what i want to say.so,here i go...last year i tried to commit suicide and i failled.now i hate myself because i eas ti chicken to try again.since then my life has been a mess....i take pill so i can wake up[pain killers] and i take pills in order to get some sleep[sedativs].and with all the stupil pills a sleep only 4 to 6 hours pro night,.all day a iwalk around like a dead person,i go to school and i get good marks so my mom is satisfied,i smile and everyone things i'm ok.yea...in the last 2 months i was preety good,i was trting to put my life in order...but why?because someone was pushing me to do all this.that persons thinks now i don't need his help anymore and he is out of my life.now i beginn to feel bad again..more and more depressed.and i'm so scared i'll feel again as bad as that time when i tried to took my life.i'm freaked out...i don't wat to feel so down again.but i have all the signs that it's all coming back paniced,i'm nervous,i cy ot of the blue,the future seems black,i cs'n fins my motivation to live again.why ?why?i can't go throught that...i have zoro power to fight agains the demons in my soul."
2883,Not sure what to do...,"My cousin is 16 years old. She's been in a really bad ""relationship"" (if that's what you want to call it) for over a year now. We've all seen this, and we've all told her that he isn't worth it, but she hasn't listened to any of it."
2884,its over... nothign left to do except...,"Ive been to therapy, talked to lots of people.... nothing is helping, i tried anger management... didnt help.... talked to preachers, my parents... it doenst help.. my friends dont even care... things will get worse... cuz the summer is 10x worse for me.... I went from Honor Roll student to STRIAGHT F's .... I dont care anymore about anything... Im a hairry 15 year old kid with nothing else on this earth to live for. The pain gets worse every day - and my friend just made everythin worse...."
2885,"Lost, Alone and forgotten","The subject says it all, I'm totally lost very alone and forgotten by nearly everyone. My mom doesn't care, I'm dad is no longer around us and my brother I rather just leave him out of this. My step brother's got his own problems....as I said I'm totally alone and I'm tired of it. I get nothing I really want. i would give anything to see my boyfriend but that's not going to happen I have nothing to live for anymore."
2886,emotional support needed.,okay well i have this friend (it really is a friend im not just emarrassed) and she told me that she was going to kill herself. she gave me an exact date and everything. she said on her 25th b-day. well i dont want her to. i asked if there was anything that would make her want to live longer she said if she fell in love or became rich and famous...then she'd live to 30. i want to talk her out of it but in the end its her choice and i honestly dont disagree i dont want to live past 25 either. should i try to talk her out of it? how? should i do it with her? so many questions and i need emotional support. i LOVE her so.
2887,tired of living,I've been in and out of therapy for 13 years. Dealing with so many issues. Lots of lost. I'm a gay black man living in NYC. I think of killing myself everyday. Most of the times I believe it's best. Only because I feel it's the only way out. So allowing myself to get closer to actually doing it...............seems more convincing.
2888,Sick and tired of this life....,"I'm 18 years old. And I'm dreadfully lonely. I spent about a month in college but dropped out because I didn't like it. I can't seem to find a school that I really like. I can't do a job because I'm much too afraid of getting fired, or learn how to drive because I'm afraid of failing. I want to be an actor, but I'm also a writer. I've even written a 132 page movie script. All my mother does is yell at me. I only leave the house about twice a week. I never know if women find me attractive because I'm too afraid to even talk to them. (I'm 6'1, dirty blonde hair, hazel eyes. If women find this attractive, they sure have a funny way of showing it...by not doing anything at all). So I feel like my life is absolutely cruddy. My closest friend doesn't even want to hear about it when I'm depressed and ends up not talking to me for a few days. I feel useless and good for nothing. All I have are my books, my music, my movies..but the things I want the most, a loving relationship, the ability to do what I love doing and get paid for it, happiness, independence...it all seems so out of reach with every passing day."
2889,I don't think I will survive much longer...,
2890,life sucks,"i just can't deal with it all anymore, i keep making things worse for myself and i can't seem to stop putting myself in positions where i get hurt, i want what i can't have but i don't want to feel like s*** all the time anymore. i don't think i could go so far as to hurt myself but i can't handle life anymore i just keep f****** up and i want 2 stop but i've wanted 2 stop for a long time and still haven't managed to do it........ i think i need serious help...... and some sleeping pills would be nice....."
2891,Suicide Survey,"I want to create a suicide survey here for the purpose of raising awareness about the problem, and allowing honest but confidential discussion about the topic."
2892,loveshy,I am such a loser I just want to die!
2893,is killen myself reallly da answer!~!~!!!,iight....i feeel liek i dont wanna live n e more...like da world doesnt want me..im sooo upset n sad n e more like all ill do is lay in my bed n cry for no reason n yes ive tired to kill myself a few times but was to scared to go all da way...ive cut my arms up pretty bad but ive stoped but its hard i feel tat times all i wanna do is die..im tired of livin n e more n its scary me alot its likes eatin me up inside....plz can sumone talk to me bout dis or does n e one else feel dis way?¿?¿
2894,yep you guessed it SUICIDE!,"Now lately I have that same feeling, my friend encouraged me to kill myself and at a down time it was not what I wanted to hear, ""he goes just kill yourself why you got the chance"" I hate him luckily my online sis has helped meo ut 99.99 percent help me I dont want to forfit life"
2895,What am i going to leave behind?,"Hey, just read sparrows post and some of that rings true im 18, I made some serious mistakes in school and screwed up real bad but luckily i managed to get into college and now i have a decent job... but the same things are going wrong all over again, im taking drugs hanging around with the same kind of idiots."
2896,just posting again about what's going on,"this may not make sense but i'll try to say this anyway. there's this bible study thing at my school i go to...i used to go to. anyway, the girl that runs the bible study talks to me every tuesday even though i don't go to the meetings anymore. when i talked to her this week, i held back my pain and didn't want to talk about it. later that night, i called her and left a message and told her of my plan to end my life in two months. she called me but i didn't answer and she came over to where i lived. i felt bad and regret telling her how much i hurt. next week is the last time i see her and i am going to tell her to not worry about me...forget i ever existed. i've been crying alot since i've thought of going through with suicide. i no longer want to burden people and getting locked up in some hospital or as some like to call it ""help"" only makes that pain in my heart worse. so...that's it i guess."
2897,Why,Why if i've never thought about suicide and have allways told myself i would never do it would i now start thinking about it? i'm afraid to die. i don't think i would ever do it cuz i wouldn't hurt my family and friends like that. I wouldn't want people to think its their fault. I have no clue why i'm even typing this. I just don't know why i would think everyones life would be better with out me. i'm sorry
2898,What's the point?,What's the point in life? I'm not happy at all and for some reason I can't find anything to be happy about. I guess all of my passions have long ended and I'm left with nothing. I don't know where to go or what to do. I feel lost. I don't even feel like hanging out with friends because I've just lost it. I know tomorrow I'll wake up and wonder why I'm even up; I'll try and force myself back to sleep. I don't care about anything. Does anyone feel like this?
2899,"Had enough, too much to take..","..It's New Years eve and i'm alone again. Just me in my house, no one who cares."
2900,my friend just tried to kill herself,"just now. i'm staying at her place in a whole other city, in a whole other province for the weekend and she lives with her boyfriend and her two cats. i'm allergic to cats and when she went to put them away in her room her boyfriend was disturbed and he got upset with her. then she got upset because he was upset with her, and before i knew it a little tiff became an all-out yelling match between he and her, and i didn't see anything because i was in the living room managing her cats and trying desperately to think of a way out of this in case he got violent with her (he's pretty big and much much much older than her you see), when all of a sudden i heard more yelling and i went into the kitchen and there was blood on the floor. i went into their room and saw that she had a cut on her wrist. i got really upset with her and started yelling while patching her up, a mistake i know i calmed down straight away, but it turned out he got his hand punctured while trying to get the knife from her and now they've gone to the hospital without me. i would have only slowed them down. so now i'm waiting for them. she and i have talked about him a lot, and as much as i want to say ""dump him"" i don't. instead i point out all the facts that make this relationship so not worth it, and she doesn't seem to listen to me, nor does she make any decisions on her own, much less act on them. i want her to be happy, but i don't want to interfere but i certainly don't want this mess of a relationship to continue."
2901,So I got a 63 on my depression test....,"Yeah, its pretty high. So, pretty much, I live in a constant state of wanting to die. I have become okay knowing that my life is worthless and that I am scum. So I ride motorcycles fast, self-destruction as a lifestyle and live on the edge hoping that one day I will die."
2902,I hate everything.,"Gosh I dont really know whats gotten into me but its making me want to kill myself and today is Christmas. Its supposed to be a happy day.... we opened up gifts last night and I feel awful now because even though I got a bunch of things - several games a pooltable etc. I realize that I dont have anyone to share any of that with. I cant really ever talk to my parents at all because they dont pay attention to me. My 2 brothers are married and hardly visit, my parents hate all of my friends except one. And he can never come over cause his grandmother wont let him and plus I think hes takign advantage of me. I hateeverything about myself and for the last 2 days besides right now I've been laying on the couch and wont get up. My parents think its because my ""games wont work"" but its not. The only reason I play these online games is to escape all of my pain, but I finally realized that I dont have anything. I hate my body, and I cant do anything like go to the pool because I feel that I'm too hairry."
2903,I dont know how much longer I can hold on...,"All my life there's been something wrong. As a child I was tormented in school, sexually abused, and had extreme verbal abuse and some physical abuse at home. My marks were strait a's. I would come home and all my parents would say is that I could do better. I was never good enough, no matter how hard I tried. In grade 9 my parents decided we were all going to move, for no reason either. My dad wasn't going to switch jobs or anything, and there was nothing this new place could offer but a ""fresh start"" as my mother put it. Some fresh start- my whole life restarted pretty much. A new home, new school, new friends, a new life; I had no say in the matter what so ever. In the months before the move I became anorexic, trying to grasp at least one thing I could control- my weight. My best friend Kat helped me through it and I began to realize I had feelings for her that exceeded friendship. She introduced me to God which helped me through all of this....the pain went away. My faith is what saved me here."
2904,young pretty smart and suicidal,"I have so many good things going for me. I'm young, pretty, smart, I can make anyone laugh, I'm a good friend, but then when I'm alone and I think about myself I break down and cry. All I can think about are about my regrets, how I'm not good enough,"
2905,isometimes i want to die,"I havent wrote in on this site in a very very long time. And I thought for awhile that maybe I can do whatever my heart tells me, instead of a bunch of peoples advice online. Truth is, I am very depressed. Inside I feel like I am dying. If anyone has ever read my other posts, you know that my father was in dying need of a liver transplant..."
2906,"Inbetween, lost, and broken","Nicole, inbetween:"
2907,God foresaken loneliness,"Okay, i never thought i would post a topic like this, but has anybody ever felt god forsaken and lonely? I mean, people (mainly on here, because i would never tell anybody in real life), just so lonely they feel there is no point in going on? I hardly have any friends and even when i do, i cannot relate to them properly, i live on my own and know nobody in the units i live in, so have no friends here. I am 35 and haven't had a relationship since i was 27, and the last relationship i had was so abusive it's amazing one of us didn't end up in jail. I don't know, i'm sure there's more. I try to retain a positive outlook on life, but get sick of the ""things will only get better"" rhetoric, because, quite frankly, is there any proof that they will? It is all just rhetoric to me. And if somebody posts and says, ""people care about you"", that's not the point."
2908,"scared, very scared",I want out of my relationship so bad. I am so scared. I am scared to leave because my bf is so violent. I'm scared that he will hurt my family if I leave him. The only way out is for me to hurt myself. I can't take the pain and abuse any longer. I just want out and I don't see any other way to do it.
2909,a reason to live/my success story,"hi, as most of you know i used to be suicidal. i tried so many times i lost count, i cut until my arms were beyond recongnition, but i havent in 3 months. i no longer want to cut. the truth is life goes on. a few years ago my best friend killed himself, right in front of me!(the 3rd friend to kill himself that year)i was in a deep depression so deep i couldnt see the surface but some how i managed to pull my act together.i have been abused and raped as a child and even thrown out of my house for months at a time to live on the streets. but now all is well. im taking my medication. talking to my therapist. i have made ammends with my father. and broken all contact with my mother. how did i pull my life together? i asked for help. so please if anyone is about to kill themself please just talk to a therapist, or a parent, or anyone who can help. after all suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem., if you feel unloved you have no idea how wrong you are, if you feel like a failure, you only fail when you quit look into the long term before you make any decisions you may regret. all my love"
2910,i don't think i will make it,"i feel like i always have alot on me. schoolwork is my main focus at the moment. i am a senior in highschool, i'm currently only taking three classes, two of them are advanced classes. we just started back from winter break but i already feel so overwhelmed. in one of my classes i feel like i bother the teacher, and i feel as if she would prefer that i drop the class. i really dont want to drop anything i have now becuase i either need it or am very interested in it."
2911,My life is always awful....,"I cant help it, I just want to die... I have no one.... all of my friends are backstabbers except one... and he lies to me a lot and makes me feel bad by the things he does. I hate my body, I'm fat and I hate how much hair I have on my chest and stomach, and its coming in on my back, im only 13... it has driven me into depression and almost to the point of ending it all."
2912,-Not Worthy For A Topic-,"I dont know why Im posting. I already tore apart my wrists and sitting here bleeding without a care. I have my bottles sitting in front of me. Remeron, Wellbutrin, and Ibuprofen in 800 mgs each. I want to waste away. I want to be nothing. I want to just be dead. I dont want attention. I dont want help. And I dont want people asking me questions or telling me Im a failure or destroying me with their words. The door is locked, the bottles are open, my wrists are bleeding. -holds head and cries- I dont know what to do..."
2913,all resources exhausted except the inevitable,hi everyone i dont know what to say. I have exhausted all forms of professional treatements including countless medications and i am still feeling chronically depressed.I have been suicidal for as long as i can remember and i dont think i can sustain that for any longer
2914,Existence seems futile,"I am not alive. Or at least, I have not felt alive in many years. Remembering the last time I even....felt much of anything is difficult. I wake up every morning and...exist. So whats the point? I understand and know how pointless suicide is. I know it is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. I will not sit here and write a suicide letter or say how everyone will be sorry when I'm gone. I doubt people would truly cry because I know they expect these feelings of me. But still...the temptation...its nail biting. I sit here and stare at the walls and want to just...seep into the paint. I want to be gone and forgotten....like I never existed. -sighs- I ramble too much....I need a coffin...."
2915,just keeps getting worst,"I have posted a topic here before and people replied mostly saying things will get better well they haven't. I don't want to kill myself but I just feel like it all the time and I think i am going to do something stupid, like I drink loads even till i am sick. I guess it's the only thing that takes my mind off it and when i am drinking I just keep drinking more and more. Don't tell me I should get counseling it's not as easy as that in England, the only things we have is a child line."
2916,Rock bottom,Seriously Considering ending it all- the pain is too much to bare
2917,Live for today?,"I here this phrase a lot... make the most of your life! *smile* Live for today, because life is a precious gift that won't last forever! *more smiles* ... that makes me want to hurl. If I lived for today, and the way the world seems today, the way I'm hurting inside and the way nothing seems right anymore, if i were to live for this moment, i think the best thing to do would be to kill myself. The only thought keeping me from doing that is that I am NOT living for today *sarcastic smile*. I am living for the little moments that may come"
2918,I don't know what to do anymore,"I don't understand all the feelings I'm having. I'm no longer happy for anything, I just got a brand new car, and all this good stuff is happening in my life, so what do I not want to live anymore. I feel I have met my true love, but he hates me now and I know we will never get back together. All I can think about is going down to the river and drowning myself, I see no point in living anymore, no one wants me here. I don't know what to do, pleae help, I just want to be happy, enjoy life. But i don't know/understand how to."
2919,To anyone considering,"The past few days in my town have been pretty rough, to say the least. One kid from my school killed himself, and over the next 2 days, 2 more kids decided to follow and end their own lives. I just wish people would consider what an impact they have on the community around them. The first kid didn't just affect his own friends and family, but everyone who knew his friends and family, and everyone who had any ties to the other kids who committed suicide. It has been extremely depressing to see my entire school and community in mourning. It's awful that these people felt so alone, because maybe things could have been different if they had only known just how many people cared about them."
2920,I'm going to kill myself one day i know it's coming,I dont know where else to put this so this will have to do.
2921,im killing myself tonight,"before i go im gonna do a few good deeds and answer some posts but ive had it, im just saying good bye to everyone here. im killing myself tonight. i can't live like this anymore. its too much. i can't stand it anymore... i hurt so much, i just got off the phone with my mom and she thinks she knows whats best for me, but she doesn't cause all the choices she makes for me are slowly killing me and she wont hear me, she won't try to see how it's killing everything good i have left inside. at the beggining of the school year everyone at school loved me cause i was always happy and positive and i made them laugh but im not that same person anymore, i died. my mom keeps telling me i can't do things, she says that because of my diabetis i wont live in the real world and i should stay home. she also said family is always there for you and not to screw them over like she thinks i want to do because they will stop being there and i said to her that she isn't there for me anyway. i get to see her maybe, MAYBE! once a week because my step dad is abusive and i am not allowed at her house, but she is right down the street from me 5 homes away from mine, and she says shes there. she doesn't even know me any more."

Its just i feel like i havent actually got ne one to talk to or rely on. What ever my boyfriend does i find a way to have an argument. Whats wrong with me. when im in a car i often find myself wishing we would crash and i would die. I constantly ache and cant bare the pain i feel ne more im not mad just sad. I always have had difficulties with my boyfriend people accusing him of cheating etc and also my bestfriend has and does lie to me so this doesnt help. I hate myself too.....i think im fat and ugly and although no one knows i often dont eat for days, just so i dont out on weight i hate eating cos i can feel myself becoming more and more fat.

2928,Is it bad?,Is it bad if you deside you want to cuz because it might bring people closer togather. If it will help people mend friendships and families.
2929,is there really a point anymore?,"my favourite quote at the moment is ""well im gona die sumtime, y nt make it now"". nobody in my life has ever taken me seriously everybody thinks im just an attention seeking fake. it hurts. ive bin a self harmer for 2 years and a drug-abuser for 6 months now. in the beggining this stopped the pain but my pain is becoming to powerful and overwhelming that i dont know what to do anymore. i told my friend that i felt like dying, i told her i think my existence is slowly fading. i brought extra drugs the other day, i was gona take them as an overdose but i bottled it. i really regret it now i want to die so much i actuly get an adreniline rush when i think about it. i have nobody to talk to in this world and im completely alone. if there is any1 out there that feels the same please talk 2 me. i need to know im not alone..........please"
2930,time is runing out!,hello!
2931,Friend in need,"Hey, ok here goes. My ex and I while going out were having some problems, we've stayed pretty close and recently we've been talking alot more (on the phone lots, spending days just talking), because I'm one of few people that she can actually talk to and trust. She told me that a few years ago she was suicidal and takes anti-depressants now and has appointments once a week with a therapist."
2932,tired of the pain... tired of everything...so tired,"I don't know how to say this... But I want nothing more then to die right now... I dont' want to live i cry every morning just that i am still alive... I have nothing really to live for... I have no one to love, school is awful no matter how hard i try i can't do it... I'm always being made fun of...I""m a joke to eeryone... even to the one i care for more then anything....everyone is so happy around me I feel like no one sees me.. i just feel invisable. I can't do anything right I try not to be such a F&^% up but no matter what, I do EVERTHING wrong...I can't please my mom with anything she always compares me to her ""younger self"" my friends don't understand me ... no one really does... I'm just Heather the 17 year old that sits at the tv all day not saying a word ""like a weird teenager"" i am..."
2933,Taking some anti-depressent tabs on top of vodka,"Ok all of you reading this are now saying something to your selves, so I dont care what anyone thinks i have put up with this life for to long now i have waited for something to go right but no, so whats the point carrying on with a worthless life like mine, come people we are only on this world for one thing and that is to help it servive, sorry but it`s a load of crap look at the world and the state we have put it in to, well thats how i feel just like this world it`s screwed up just like my head, any way back to me, well i`m sittling here typing away like a fool we are all fools if we are going to kill our selves then lets done it done just bloody say it don it as im going to as soon as i finish this crap."
2934,life sucks,"life sucks............and i just cant go on anymore............i just cant do this anymore...........i just cant anymore..............life just isnt for me........people just need to understand that life just isnt for certain people..........when this unworthy body is laid to waste, may my soul remain among the blessed, for, to the utmost of my knowledge, i have wronged nobody............."
2935,Is it wrong for me to hear someone tellin me to kill myself?,I've got somthin to ask and i hope someone knows the answer it normal to hear voices (not normal but is it just somthin some people do) and second is it normal to like hear screams in your sleep not just like bad dreams but just people screaming and like horible screams like so bad that it makes you not want to go to sleep at night (yet again not normal like every one but like just some people do it).
2936,Has it really come to this?,"Here I am once again. I think the last time I posted on this board was over a year ago and that was about a relationship of mine that went terribly wrong. It's been more than a year since then and to be quite honest, nothing has improved, it's only grown worse since that time."
2937,Why is it like this...,"I can honestly say that if it wasnt for the fear of the pain of dying, i would be dead right now. Nothing in my life goes right, im currently in the process of applying for college, and i feel so much pressure from my parents to do well and to make something of my life that it alone is driving me crazy. That isnt even close to the worst of it thought, the worst part is my relationship with a girl who i met this summer. I met her and i quickly fell in love with her but it was at camp so of course after it ended we had to go back to our own homes. She lives many hours away and i almost never get to see her. I recently took a trip down, and sitting in the movies just holding her hand i have never been happier. Ive never had a girlfriend ever and she is the first girl i ever even loved but because of the distance she believes we cannot commit to a serious relationship and i see her point. The whole situation is killing me and i dont know what to do or how to get over it. All i want is to be with her, and i just cant have it, and with all the other pressures on me like school, work, family, and college, i just cant take it, im lost looking for a point to my life but i dont even know if one exists."
2938,"My world is falling apart, and I can't seem to fix it.","My name is Mikiesha Lussier Hughes. I'm 18 years old and I feel like I'm dying inside. I need to talk to someone about this. I have been depressed a lot of my young life. My depression stems from my family, namely my parents. Married for 34 years (this past June 19th) they are divorcing. My parents marriage was more like a parent/child relationship. I.E. Mom wasn't allowed to do"
2939,Suicide living...Cancer killing,I want to tell every one who did reply to my post thanks and i know that all of your voices really did help.I want to tell every one that life is worth living and even if you think that you are feeling so bad and even if the odds are stacked against you you can make it i've got a story to tell so listen up:
2940,Whats the point in going on..,"ive just basically had enough of every thing like i dont see the point in living, ive felt like this for so long. thiers just nothing in my life i want to life for, the only thing thats stopping me doing it is my parents. i dont want to do this to them but i just hate my life."
2941,Thinking about it,"I'm not planning to kill myself, but lately it doesn't sound as crazy as it used to. I can't get anything going in my life, so a lot of times i think dying would make it less painful. I don't have a"
2942,should i talk to them?...,Okay here is the deal as all the people who have read my few post know i just came through a really dark time in my life and although i thought every one hated me or had given up on me i have realized that a few never gave up on me and those few are my only friends but any way one of them wants me to come talk to her youth group about what i went through she thinks it could help them from going through it but im not sure if i should or if it would help i guess im scared that some of them would take it wrong and think i am weird or still like that (suicidal) and then just dislike me more what should i do?
2943,Tonight may be my last night....,"I am SO GLAD that I found this forum.... this is my last hope, and I hope some of you will take the time and can perhaps help me. Sorry for this being so long but I'm just going to get it all out."
2944,Well Im back,"After talking to a very kind person called Scout who I owe everythhing to helped me realise how ill I was and after talking to Scout I rang up the hospital and told them the situation and they got an ambulance to me which i can say didn`t take long at all to get to me, and now after a break in hospital i feel alot better, and I will say again it`s all thanks to scout"
2945,Contemplating,I have been pretty screwed up to start with. I do a lot of self injury. I have tried to stop but I can't. Right now I just don't think I can take living anymore. I know you are all thinking yea you can just suck it up because we all do but I can't help feeling this way.
2946,The Thoughts are coming back...,I thought of it once and it wasnt as bad as this time now iam cutting shooting and even drinking poison which is now i believe starting to slowly kill me i have been at this for a month and the half or so and ya guess no1 cares just telling ya i may not be around this time seeing the fact i just drank sum soda mixed with this poison stuff anyway its been fun but bye now
2947,almost commited suicide..need serious help,"i have been in depression for years now....i dont know how to get rid of it...i even tried to be a happy person, but it doesn't help. My life is just really bad, and sometimes a few tears come down each time i think about it which is almost all the time. The thing that helps me get by is that i always try."
2948,They tell me to.,"I told my family about my suicidal feelings yesterday and they told me to go ahead and do it. Naturally, im even more upset by this and ive tried to do it on several occasions before. I dont know what to do anymore, I just want out. I want to die but my boyfriend wants me to live, and i dont know if i can bear to hurt him.Life is just too painful though.."
2949,why shouldnt i end my life,why shouldnt i just give into this pain that drags me back down this little voice in my head tellin me im not good enough to be here tellin me that i should cut my self but it aint never gone that deep and i know it will one day i can feel it growin stronger i know if i try to fight it ill just lose it aint somthin you can fight off it lives and breaths inside me and i can feel it just growin deep down in my soul its like its waitin for me to give in and when it thinks i should give up and i dont it tells me to cut myself and im afraid that if i dont then somthin worse might happen like the accident.
2950,he`s gone,"Everyone I am very sorry to announce this but cloud-walker has taken a large overdose and im sorry to say he never made it dispite all the help he never made it, I have read some of the things that have been posted but nothing would of been able to help him..........................."
2951,6 hours til he says its his time..*Please..I need advice*,"Okay..earlier today, my guy friend Sam text msgs me and tells me that after work he needs to talk to me cause he felt like just crying and talking about some stuff....Now this guy is a great friends and very loyal, but he lives in this ""ghetto thug"" world of his own..He has a decent life from what i see physically...as in like..if you looked at him..youd think hed have money, etc...materialistic things mean nothing though...and well...From what i know ... his family is ""normal""; but his mother passed away and he doesnt get along with his step mom...(He texted me about a minute ago saying : It's my time to go see my Mom Kim...time is up for me...I'm making the call)"
2952,Prozac linked to suicide -- warning,"Today in school we were having discussions about current events going on in the world. We started talking about how water over in the UK drinking water is contaminated with the anti-depressent drug known as Prozac. A large portion of people in the UK take Prozac ( I think around 30% of the population) and the water and sewage treatment plants do not recognize Prozac so they do not try to take it out of the water (although they are now going to star upgrading the facilities). If you drink enough water you will feel the effects of the Prozac. Also, since Prozac hasn't been around very long, doctors are just finding out now that when younger children take Prozac it causes them to have suicidal tendencies ( I dont know how young they mean.. teens? preteens? younger?) There have already been lawsuits against Prozac by families who have lost their children to suicide related to the drug. I dont want this post to get lengthy so I'll just finish up. If your pregnant you might not want to drink the tap water (drugs are bad for the baby), and if you're young you might not want to drink it either. Buy some bottled water I hope this helped some people and brought knowledge to others."
2953,where has he gone?,"Friends,"
2954,my boyfriend is telling me he's gonna kill himself,"i started dating this really awesome guy a while ago. he has turned into my other half, he completes me. i didnt think he had a very messed up life, but i knew that the music he listens to doesnt help him. he listens to ICP and Twiztid [those kind of murder rap groups] and hey, i like them too... but he takes the lyrics a little too seriously i think. so, he started talking about his past to me. telling me hes tried killing himself before, hes gone to a mental institution 3 times before. but, he told me i make him happy. he wants me for eternity. just yesterday, i got into a fight with my parents and was upset, so i called him. i told him how i hated my parents, but at least i had him. then he said ""not for long"" and i took that by surprise. he had never talked about killing himself as long as he was with me... but, he told me that his time had come, and he was just so sick of the crap that he was going to kill himself tomorrow [today]. so i told him that i wont stand in his way or stop him from doing something if he really thinks it will be good. maybe suicide"
2955,goodbye hopefuly,I dont try to hurt myself its like just somthin i do its not really me doin it its like there is this voice in my head tellin me to end my life tellin me that life isnt that good tellin me i cant win and then i think to my self why not i should do it as if any one would notice and then i decide to do it i look at this blood stained knife and i can feel it this is for the best i lift it to my throat say a little somthin and then i lower the knife ive done it it feels so good and then theres pain and in my sleep i here these voices or more like screams and i tryed to get to them at first but now im one of them one of them screamin on the inside someone help me but on the outside im just the kid in town that pops pills and cutts and smokes and all the parents tell their kids stay away from him hes just trouble well im troubled on the inside and no one sees it cause they are to busy stayin away from me to even know what im about i know that it aint normal but i aint goin to know institute were every oine is so druged they dont even know theyre in the world but hey im like that half the time so whats so bad about this life you ask that would make me want to do this well people and the fact that i aint never got anything all the stuff i have i worked for and now thats been yanked out from under my nose so well maybe this will be goodbye

They complain about the house being dirty when i do the best i can. They complain about what i cook for dinner. They complain over my grades when they have no idea whats going on. They just expect so much out of me that i cant take it anymore. All i want to do is take a gun and shoot the bullet through my throat making sure that i die. I dont want to live anymore because i just cant take it.
2968,Just somthin to get off my chest,"Here I am sitting at my desk putting pressure on the trigger of my fait, I can feel the cold blue steal pressing on the side of my head. The gun doesn't care what I think or how I lived it is just a tool like a hammer it's just a means to an end."

2973,Lately my life has lost its worth.,"I've had a lot of alone time, and I've been thinking about life. It seems like the purpose of life is to tease us, by giving something so enjoyable, but then we are always stripped of this thing we love so much eventually. Knowing that I am going to die in the next hundred years seems so depressiong. I also feel like getting a job is stupid. Its as if we work and work all our life, until we are too old to get out and have fun. I have been thinking that I would rather live on the streets and not have to worry about morgage, tax, and bills. Everyone has been asking why I am so sad lately, but I never want to talk about it in fear of my thoughts making their life depressing also. I need someone to help me realize why I choose to live, just to die later."
2974,"Seeking Councilling, Therapy, Medication","Hey ive been told by many people over the past year that i should seek out medical guidance on depression however... i cant talk with my parents as they wouldnt understand, they believe life is fun and happy and would frankly laugh if they heard i was ""depressed"" they would say i dont understand the meaning of the word. and also my doctor is close friends with my parents so i am unable to turn to him. Finally i am only 16 so im not sure whether it is the law for any proffessional that knows of a child taking anti depressants that there parents/guardians must know about it. Finally i have noticed that a lot of people are from the states on here, i am from the UK so that may create more of a problem, please reply when you can"
2975,severe depression and revulsion,hey its me teri age 21
2976,pain and suffering,"hi my name is teri and im 21 years old- i have been suffering from social anxiety and boredom ever since i can remember. then at age 11 i developed epilepsy. i feel like i cant communicate to any1 and i hate the pressure i get from my dad most of all but i cant live without him either. both of my parents are diabetic. i have no family or friends. its impossible for me to make friends since i suck at everything. i constantly have suicidal thoughts and i cant make it goaway. i hate being at risk for every disease like cancer and diabetes- it runs in the family. its bad enough that i wear thick glasses and i have hair loss. ive had to drop out of school because of this. i feel like exploding. if any1is suffering like me or going thru social anxiety, please feel free to email me at"
2977,Looking for some answers... hopefully,"Hey, this is my first time posting on here. I'll just get straight into things. I often suddenly go into a mood of depression for no aparent reason and when I do it is serious depression. I have attempted an O.D before by taking 48 pain killers at once. I heard 20 of them would do so I had to make sure. That day at school was very emotional. I survived and was ill for 4 days with what my parents believed to be food poisoning. I become very lost in my own thoughts wondering what I am going to do with my life and whats the point in doing anything when we are just going to die? All this could not be worth it. Everyone says things will get better. Yeh they get better for maybe a day or a week, then a big 2 months of utter depression and suicidal thoughts comes and steam rolls them happy times and always unbalances them. Also I often think about very bad depressing things like what I would feel like if my mum was to die or I empathise with people and then feel their pain and suffering which drags me down even more. I lie awake at night for hours on end thinking about everything bad under the sun, thinking how can it all end, what do I need to do before I go. This doesnt help as I only get 2-4 hours sleep a night so the tirdness adds on again to the almost monitinous pile of things that is wrong with life. I can't turn to my parents as they will most certainly not take me seriously and I do not think I would have the confidence to say anything to them. Some respondance fast would be very helpful. Even just an insight into why I am like this. I have thought that I may have real psychological problems but then again I also think that it could be a case of me just reaching out for some attention which frustrates myself even more because I can't stop myself feeling like this. Well thats it..."
2978,I have to end it,Im so depressed i have a valid reason for suicide.... i have tinnitus
2979,yeh,im fed up with tryin as someone told me why dont i give in im fed up with puttin all my strength into fightin it im gonna lay down and let my self sink slowly into it i mean how do we know what it feels like to die and the way i see it death is the most wonderful gift of all you have nothin left to worry bout nothin but time and darkness and well thats pretty much what i got now cept for it aint always that way when i see people lookin at me weird because i aint dressed just like them or when i hear someone cuss me under their breath or when the one person that i thought would always be there for me left me to be alone why oh why would i chose to stay here why cant i except the fact that i aint never gonna have nobody that will stay on my side and then i could just move on to what had to be done like all these people around me wouldnt have to look at me anymore and they wouldnt have to tell me i dont belong in their town i could leave now but i cant run for ever i got to stand tall and face them but then i get kicked out of another school because once i start i take out all the pain trapped inside and i cant stop i hit them and i dont mean to keep hittin them but i cant stop till my arms get tired and feel like bricks and im afraid one day i will go to far and this voice inside of me is tellin me to do it end it it aint nothin to it you got what you need pull it to your throat and let it slide let all your problems end why not there aint nothin stoppin you and then i tell it to shut up and ill pass out and wake up feelin worse and all this pain all the screams i hear in my head they actually make me give up all hope of ever livi a normal life and i see the light at the end but every time i take a step it gets dim tell me is this hell were livin in if so hevans got to be better but if were hell bound whatever it dont matter
2980,driving me crazy...,i know everyone has thoughts at one point or another of suicide...and alot of people try to carry out those thoughts....but what do you do when those thoughts flood your head like crazy? what do you do when you just sit there like in school and all you can think about is suicide...how do i shake those thoughts? the other night i tried to commit suicide again...i've done it a couple of times but all i end up doing is passing out or something.
2981,"I'M HERE TO SAY, SUICIDE IS N O T THE WAY!!","To anyone set on committing suicide...especially when another person is involved, I'm here to say, that's not the way! In the first place, if you are a Christian...you know that God gave you life and can take your life at His discretion. Not yours. You'll go to hell !"
2982,When you just don't want to be alone... (PLS READ),"well, i really can't think of a fancy, elaborate or anything but blunt way to say this, so i guess i just will."
2983,my mom tried to od on prescription drugs 18 hours ago,"ok so i have used this forum for my own needs. trying to get back my ex whom i thought i needed soooo much. well, last night or rather 3am on sept 15th i got a rude awakening. I was trying to sleep in my room when my dad hollered for me to go into the kitchen. my parents who i am staying with temporarily had been having a dia=sagreement for the better part of the night but, seemed to be keeping it mildly toned. i was not prepared to walk in to a room where my dad is asking me to have my mother ""tell me"" what she has swallowed because she refuses to inform him. he is holding her in his arms she is barely able to stand yet she is trying to push more pills into her mouth. not a very easy attempt considering my dad is bear hugging her. so, i start asking she starts refusing. my dad asks her to let him drive her to the hospital. she starts saying that she just wants the pain to end. it gets foggy to me here..... but all i hear is her say that it is her personal choice to do what she wishes with her life. you want to know my answer to that? ok well, i'm making a personal decision to pick up he phone and dial 911 instead of try and talk a not so mentally stable person into going to the hospital. i'l llet the paramedics do that. how am i able to sit here and type this? dont ask me maybe its because im in shock that my mom would do this and i havent quite let it sink in. who mind you at 25 really wants to deal with their mother trying to quit on life? a little discussion could do me good right about now. i dont think when a person sets to ending it all they realize that they arent just ending it all for them. someone loves them unconditionally and even if they dont see it they need to be aware of it. i make no apologies for my actions. and it was extremely hard to look my own mother , whom i love more than i love anyone, and tell her i made that call. i wont back down on it. because while my dad was trying to negotiate extremely crucial time was going by. ok anyone thoughts??????"
2984,Come on people,Come on people.............EVERY1 and i mean EVERY1 has something to live for...............wanting 2 end ur life now is not the way 2 go out...........you have 2 hold on.........give it time..........and be positive..........i wanted 2 end my life so many times i lost count.......because i thought it was an easy way out.......ending my life..............well people.........ITS NOT.........a lot of you out there might be depressed and mite cut but u guys just dont understand that you were put on earth 2 do something for this world..........whether its trying 2 take over the world or making something big and shiny...............but the point is every person has their own objective set out for them................and if you were 2 hold on.......and put up a fite...........you will find that reason..............wanting 2 die or hurting urself does not help one bit.............trust me ive tried both..........and yes ive been depressed............i was depressed for 4 months..............but then my eyes were opened and i saw for the first time why i was meant 2 live....................you all have 2 open your eyes and see what you were meant 2 live for................stay positive..........find the good in everything.......and hold on........things will get better
2985,how do i help her...,"my best friend has tried to kill herself many times before. she hates herself and she thinks shes just a terrible person. the truth is that i look up to her...she is my hero. shes everything i want to be and so much more. shes smart,pretty, has a great personality, is loved by many, but she still hates herself. shes been a cutter for sometime now and she still occasionally tries to kill herself. shes never really scared me until lately. i can't live without her...i mean i've already had two of my best friend pass away i dont need another one to go too. she means everything to me and i can't lose her! lately shes been having a tough time dealing with everything....and we dont talk as much about stuff like we used to. im so scared that shes gonna do something...except i get the feeling that this time if she does....she'll be gone. what can i do??? how do i talk to her?? please help"
2986,Why suicide,Why do people become suicidal i just can't comprehend the idea of wanting to kill or hurt urself? could someone explain it to me.
2987,Depression Medication,"I dont see the point in this, why feel something fake? I constantly feel suicidal and depressed for a number of reasons i have explained before. But to force emotion is to lose identity and life. You know that there is something to live when you feel, its wen you feel nothing inside as i have experienced when you are really low. And even then you should never take medication to fix things, you either get through it and live or cave into it and die. that is life, how we die."
2988,desperate to die,"It's been awhile since I've been on. Life is pretty hectic for me. I'm pretty much 'homeless' right now. I am always staying at a different house every night. It's killing me. I hate school, people...everything. I really do. I thought I had so much to live for but I can't do this anymore. Moving from place to place, being told I'm okay when I'm CRAZY and all I ever do is plan ways to die. ITS NOT NORMAL!!! Nobody understands. I would rather go to a 'loony bin' or girls' town then die but how am I supposed to do that? When Mom thinks I'm okay? I hate it, all I do it cry. I can't go on. nothing matters anymore."
2989,i just want to help my friend... i dont want her to die!,"My friend, has been suicidal for a long time. She has switched schools because she attempted suicide. Now last night she wanted to do it again. Luckily a friend talked her out of it and she dropped the knife. She cuts almost every night just hoping that she will one day cut too deep, though she doesnt cut on any major veins cuz if her parents find out she will be sent to a hospital. She is such a wonderful person and I just want to know what to say to her! I tell her she has so much going for her but she just doesnt see it. I tell her people love her but she said she doesnt care if she hurts the ones that love her when she dies. I just dont know what to do and immeidate response would be nice because I'm really scared. Scared for her and scared just as a friend. Does anyone know ANYTHING reassuring I could say to her? I don't want another of my friends dead. I want to be able to help..."
2990,suicidal ramble.,"This will probably be long, since I'm doing pretty bad tonight. I don't want your sympathy, just your comments and the freedom to write my thoughts."
2991,why go on?,"Sometimes I feel that my life has no purpose, no meaning. Why should I go on if everybody is gonna die someday? I will die, and everybody that loved me, and everybody that I loved will die. The places that I liked will change, the houses where I lived at will disapear. And every tear that I dropped, every night that I couldn't sleep, every nightmare that I had will all be in vain. I see a dark road in front of me and I think I'll never be able to be happy again. I have no God to guide me, no hope, no deam. I'm completely lost and confuse. The world seems so unfriendly. I think that everybody hates me, but, above all, I hate myself."
2992,My Life As I Know It,Alright... First off I want to say that I am young and from say the age of ten or so I have wanted to commit suicide...
2993,help please out of options,ok hi and bye everyone. well today i tried to break it off with a gurl i love and care about alot. i dont feel im healthy enough to carry on a relationship at this point that we should break up and she said something about going to kill herself over it so so am i i can take that guilt. am i wrong for wanting out of a relationship i am mentally unstable to be with her right now.? well thinking of suicide now if she does im as good as gone i dont know what else to do im responsible for the deaths of 3 friends and apparently now the a girl i love does anyone have any suggestions besides suicide because the way i see it im out of options.
2994,just read this first,"this is for all of you that want to kill themselves, i know what you are going through. i wish i was dead to... or at least i did because i just lost my girlfriend for good and she was the only thing i had. but anyway think about this before you do it, picture that you really did die, think about how you would feel never being able to see your friends, or maybe someone that you love. think about that, suicide wont get rid your problems you will just lose everything you have or see. just yesterday i overdosed on amphetamines because my girlfriend broke up with me, luckily i didnt die and now after thinking about what i just wrote i dont want to kill myself. I just cant think about never seeing the people in my life again, it makes my stomach upset. just think about the things you do before you do them... i learned this the hard way."
2995,Hoping an expert will read this...,"I have realised I have a big problem, but don't know if just going to the doc for pills will help. Does anyone know how I can get proffesional help."
2996,"There is no hope for me, I must go",Oh god! I have heard so many stories about people being depressed over serious stuff but I feel like my situation is hopeless. I am about to get of college but the thing is I may not pass one of my classes which means I wouldn't graduate.
2997,there's no point in going on...,"Day after day lingering living, but for what he could kill me any day I hope he does or I will. There is nothing to live for but death.."
2998,How to kill myself best,I was so happy I found this place. I have been so depressed lately over my relationship. Feeling suicidal and confused and couldn't talk about it to anyone. I told him I was posting on a forum. Just needed to talk. Just please let me have this. He wouldn't. He came on and signed up and read everything I wrote. Stuff I just needed to talk to someone about.
2999,curious about my thoughts..,"Well don't worry I've never caused myself any injury and I don't plan on it....but the thing is I find myself contemplating suicide a lot. I just play out the scenario in my head...how, where I would do it..but mostly I think about everybody's reaction to it. When you know someone well enough you can predict their reaction to many situations. Most of the people I don't want them to go through the pain I predict they would have...but there's sometimes where I want some people to feel it. I want them to feel guilty. One scenario I figured leaving a note telling a certain someone it's their fault, so they would be left with the guilt."
3000,another whats the point post,"So why is it that several times per year it seems I find myself in the same situation? When I climb out of it and put it behind me I feel temporary happiness which is just that, temporary. The cause every time thus far has been the opposite sex. Not that I've had bad women, quite the opposite, just that every complication that I couldn't have imagined has become my life. I've just now finally realized that women are the same as cocaine, expensive and make you feel great, but not permanently and coming down is much much more painful than any drug I've come accross. Women aren't the sole cause, they just end up escorting me to rock bottom once you pile on the realizations that people are selfish ignorant garbage as a quick generalization."
3001,easiest way...,"I want to know the easiest way to end my life. Is it gun, knife, o.d....um...just give me some ideas. Don't tell me why I should stay because I shouldn't. Everyone would be happier if I was gone."
3002,I want to die,"I have had nothing left to live for for the past two years or so...not one thing And I wish to end my life... do you think it's justifiable, seeing as I really don't have anything left to live for. I have no pleasure or enjoyment or even tolerance of anything. Is this ok to anybody...I mean, is it reasonable to do this? Thank you."
3003,Just a note to people about suicide,"Hi. I have been reading through some ppls posts and I have noticed that some ppl think that certain medications can cause suicidal thoughts. I just wanted to tell ppl that this isn't the case, so that u arent scared of using medications. The reason ppl think that medications make you suidical are for a few reasons. They are:"
3004,confused,just don't now what to do any more haven't been on my meds in a long time . im up then im down . took aload of pill last nigth to sleep but for some resone im still here.i us to hooked on pain pills do you think i build up some kind of tollerns to them . its nothing new to me thow it ant the frist time didn't even knock me out. but im over being hooked on pills . last nigth was just to try to end the pain . you know what i meen .
3005,"to all the ""hang in there!""-smooth talkers...","here's one for you: I'm 26 live in a small country in europe, but am originally from another country in europe, so the one I'm living in is pretty much racist about the one I am from. and I'm sick of it! it's hard to find either job or apartment due to my ""so exotic name"", blablah."
3006,I feel wreckless right now.....,Im so fricken tired of this CRAP im getting close to it......Im looking through drors right now for pills and i dont wanna be here anymore im getting so strained and depressed i dont know why i am.Everything is just going wrong and becoming so truthful to me on how everythign is.If i was able to get my hands on some pills id prolly do it but.... since the last time my brother tried to kill himself my mom hides the pills....maybe i should use somehting else but things like knives im scared of

3009,"My best friend's dad commited suicide, what do i say? help!",I just found out that my best friends dad commited suicide yesterday by electricution. Im in total shock at the moment and another mate of mine suggests a couple of us (about 5) goto my best friend (Ty) house on thurs to give him support.
3010,"Contemplating everything, and setting things straight","Suicide..people ask questions and contemplate suicide; when people respond to them though, they say something like ''think about all the people you will be hurting, think about the people who care about you and will miss you''"
3011,bloody visions,"well things have finally got to the point where im about to kill myself again. now, things have been going fine for a while. but now im fighting with my dad, all my old problems are coming back to get me.things arent all bad i have a girlfriend now but i dont think she cares about me at all. all i want is to be alone and i cant do that. i want to bleed i want to sleep and never wake up. i want to be sad. i need help badly how can i stop wanting to die.i know there are people who care about me but i really dont care about that anymore my life is so insignificant. if i die a hundred years from now no one would even. please help me.i just want to bleed ive gotten to the point where most men have sexual fantasies i have fantasies of dying my bloody dreams.help me please"
3012,Can't do this anymore,"Hi, Im new."
3013,"Help me, I am falling into the abyss of my own subconcious","I feel like I'm drowning in my everyday. I'm 29 years old and a single mother of 2 sons, 10 and almost 5. I have been through my father dying at a young age, dropped out of HS to get prego and go on welfare with my alcoholic husband that I kicked out several years ago. I then rebounded and had another child. I'm now living at my mother's house for past year and a half, going to college for past almost 4 years and only have about 6 more months to complete my BS in Public Administration. I have my AA in Criminal Justice already but I have no idea why I ever went into school. I'm many thousands of $'s in debt and can't so much as afford shampoo let alone a bill 'cause I can't get any hours at work. I'm a writer and for years have been trying to get published with no avail. I'm having issues with the state over child support with the kids. One dad's trying to get $ from me even though I have our son 75% of the time. I have been drinking more and more lately and have eaten potentially 1800 calories worth of food in the past 6 days and nothing tastes good to me anymore. I was cornered by a friend of mine 2 days ago because of my depression. He took away my keys to keep me from going out to drink more so I proceeded to hit him enough that my arm and knuckles hurt now. He called my sis and bro in law and had them come to get me. It was humilliating. That only taught me not to tell anyone close how I really feel. I met a man 3 months ago whom I fell in love with and now with no warning, and supposedly because his ego won't let him allow me to pay for things when he's broke, he broke up with me via email of all things. I have been given a never-ending supply of anti-depressants from my DR., about 7 months ago, but have stopped taking them. I have Multiple Sclerosis and have stopped taking my weekly injections as I can't do it myself and missed seeing my friend who does it for me last week. I believe the only thing in my life that's kept me from suicide many other times are my children. There's no one else for them but me. I still make last-second decisions every day to avoid swerving my car ](*,) into on-coming traffic. OMG, help me please.........."
3014,Help me please!!!1,"ok i had a huge fight with my dad just now. im pretty tore up, but not a big deal, the problem would be i just attempted suicide and failed, im homeless because i got myself thrown out, and if anyone is gonna say ""tell the cops if he hits you"" ive tried it would only make things worse, besides ive been locked in a mental house for cutting so they think its self injury. im out of options my mom doesnt want me, my dad kicked me out, i am homeless almost out of cash, i got fired,i see no way out except trying again and doing it right this time. please someone help me!!!!!"
3015,All who think of killing themself--PLEASE READ,Hi... below are reasons not to kill yourself... please read them and think about them hopefull they will change your mind about Suicide...
3016,What pill is the best pill?,hi again people
3017,Your opinion on suicide,I have a question for everyone.Now seeing as how i have attempted suicide before many question's have reoccurred in my mind since i have done it.Is suicide selfish?Is it a personal choice or a choice that someone has driven you to?Is it right or wrong.What do you think.I would just like to know what everyone's opinion of suicide is.
3018,"yep, I don't like life","I mean each second I breathe I am surprised I am still alive has the world gone crazy or have I?!?!?!?!?!?!? well for one thing one of us has, I was doing better than ever last night I was on top of the moon livin life to the fullest and then out of bloody no-where my life erupted now I have been crying and sxreaming and lots of things...."
3019,Teenager....dead? I WISH!,"It all started when my mum and dad got divorced they always argued about me and both of my sisters blamed it on me, that was 3 years ago we all know how long soliciters can take , ever since this ive cried myself to sleep every night, cut my wrists frequently. i tried to take an overdose quite a few time but through all the pills back up again. everytime i looked at the cuts i would cry and do it all over again until it became quite a viscious cycle!I started seeing a shrink and she put me on pills i grew so much faith in her i couldtell hereverything until one day she FORGOT to turn up to one of my appointmeants. this killed me inside i kept thinkin ""god i must b so selfish to even think sum1 would waste there time on me in the first place. So i stopt takin my anti-deppressants and went back to the cryin and cuttin. Then as usual right at the wrong time turns up LOVE. me n a guy called James started hangin out together he knew about my problems but he didnt mind i was so happy that for once sum1 wasnt judgin me for it. but i fell deeper and deeper w/ him and i love him soo much then he sees sum of the cuts on my wrists and gets all patronisin sayin stuff like ""u dnt need to do that u only do it for attention coz u want sum1 to pity u"" That night i cried so much and cut again.we made up but jus recently hes told me he doesnt love me any more and just wants to be friends i dunno what ive dun. all i konw now is that the only 2 ppl i have ever trusted in my life have let me dwn they wernt there wen i needed them the most and now i c no point in livin and really want to die but i dnt no how to do it coz everytime a pills goes nr my mouth i wanna thro up how can i put myself ut of this misery"
3020,There's no other way,"I am completely lost. I don't see anything good in life anymore and I just want it to be over. I've lost my job and my significant other and it's just too gut-wrenching to wake up every day. I considered getting some help but no job means no insurance and honestly I don't think there is anything that would help me at this point. I've weighed all my options and I think that it would be better if I were dead. It's just too hard to keep going, I don't have anything left to wake up for."
3021,I can't even kill myself,"I recently had my beautiful fiancee end our relationship after four years of being together. Well, it was entirely my fault, I never appreciated how wonderful she was to me, and didn't realize what I was doing until it was too late. Two nights ago, I tried to end my life with a megadose of Ambien, Tramadol and alcohol. I ended up vomiting all over the place and sleeping for about 36 hours, and making her even more angry at me. The amount of stuff I took would have killed anyone else. It sound ridiculous I know, but the loss I feel is incredible. We have a home together, with three kids (all hers) and two cats. I have lost my family, and don't know where to turn or what to do. I know that when I move out, I will lose her forever. But if I don't get away from her, I will drive her away more. Everyone keeps telling me that I am not alone in my pain, that many others have gone through the same thing. But you know, that doesn't really make anything feel any better. I just feel like trying to kill myself again. I can't stop crying, and it feels like there is no hope for me anymore. I will never enjoy another Christmas (our anniversary), never enjoy going to the beach again (that's our place), all the happiness is just gone from everything. From anyone who has been through something similar, how do I make the pain go away? How do I make it better? I am so lost..."
3022,things will never be the same again!,ok so this may seem as though it is an everyday problem but to me it just doesnt seem it.
3023,suicide!!!!!!,"im typing this and i cant stop crying....im all alone at home and im one step of doin something to my self ""suicide""...im fed up!!!! i just hate my life!!!!!.....or wait!!! i dont even have one!!!! i hate everyone specially my parents!!! they're driving me crazy...i bet most of u girls go to ur mothers when u need something...but if i told her anything abt my love life....she would start screaming at me and she will go on and hit me!!!!IM 15 YEARS OLD AND THEY HIT ME!!!!!!!!"
3024,I want to die,"i am 16 and a junior in high school. i'm a star athlete but i have no real friends. i have many people who think they are my friends, but they're not. they pick and choose when to hang out with me and when i call them they always tell me they'll call me back and they never do. i'm never invited to any get togethers and i find myself spending every minute of every weekend at home. i have little to no luck with girls. i don't want to OD on some pills, but i am looking into where i can get a gun to just end everything. my life has no purpose."
3025,To those who think suicide is an option...,"Hello everyone, I'm asking you to kindly read this as a response to most of the posts in this area, for there are too many to reply to as a whole. I know I am younger than most of you on here, but please pay no attention to that, just read this and take it seriously. For all of the people who have posted here considering suicide...."
3026,I HATE it sometimes whats the point?,"Lately things have been crappy and i just dont see the point in much of anything anymore.All i do now is work,sometimes go do things with friends which just makes me more depressed, and come home and play games till i have to go to sleep.My family is totally screwed with ruthless backstabbers everywheee,it doesnt seem like my mom respects me much anymore,and things r just lame.I havent been doing good in school because of some depression and just dont feel liek doing much.Whenever im around most of my friends all it is is a testerone fight with stupid comments and stuff that makes me feel like crap.Then with girls i get told im ugly in indirect ways and like sometimes when i walk by i hear them say ewwww but i dont know if its something of their conversation but i think its just me.I mean why does it feel like everybody around me can get girlfriends i mena i see many people talkign to girls and having agreat time why cant i...I am a really nice person who doesnt get treat back the way i should be.Stupid perverted friends get girlfriends who r so sick,kind of mean,lazy,and stupid.Why should i do these things and try to treat people nicely when i never get anything back in return.Even at work when i bust my a$$ off when i help waitresses bus their tables and help when i got plenty of stuff to do on my own.Yet i dont get any respect and im always treated like the ""kitchen B*tch"" although im nice to them.Why do us nice people have to be ugly and not have much.Why do people like me who try to keep good morals and would treat a girl with good respect and never push a thing like sex on them?Why do all woman go for the damn hot a holes and never give people like me one single chance?I dont get life at all and i think its pretty cruel and i dotn know why i spend most of my time being so nice but i like to be.This things always arouse suicidal tendencies and im afraid i might do such a thing one day.There have been days that i have been close and it seems like those things have been coming back.I hate thinking how sucky it is just sitting here playing games all day when i have nothing else to do and i think ""i wish i had a girlfriend to spend my time with"".... although i doesnt seem like that would come.I just have this frame of mind that thinks so negative i cant get out of it and it makes depressed..."
3027,Suicide,"So, I had my first suicide thought today while watching TV. I thought I wouldn't really miss anything if I hang myself tonight."
3028,"I'm smart and I don't want to die, but I have a feeling....","Alright. I know you guys get TONS of ""Oh, I'm going to kill myself because life sucks"" threads. This is not one of them."
3029,no need for this,"i am going to apologize in advance if i offend anybody... there is no need for this forum because if people actually are seeking help or trying to get advice then they really dont want to die. I say get over yourself, and stop trying to act like you are actually going to kill yourself because although it does happen not many people will seek advice about it before doing it they are usually too far over the edge."

(itll be the 3rd this year). so yesterday i was kind of mad at myself for not going thru with it, and cut myself. (im a cutter occasionally, usually when im numb) i picked a new day. May 26, 2004. those numbers equal 17-my age. i know i sound crazy, but what's the point of being here if im always gonna be upset, and my friends are too caught up in themselves to reach out. i dont want to tell my boyfriend b/c i know id scare him. he already has too much to deal with. but im hurting, and i dont know whether or not to tell anyone. i dont know if i for sure wanna do it, but it feels like the only way. i just want out. what should i do? yes- i already see 2 therapists (one in school, one out) no i have not even hinted to my suicidal thoughts. dont want people to know so they try to stop me i guess. i dont know. help."

3044,Feeling lost.. gay... suicidal..etc.,"Hi. I'm not accustomed to telling my story to such a wide audience, so I may ramble just a bit. I'm 17 years old and living a a fairly good life. I make straight A's, I'm involved with the Boy Scouts as a vollunteer (love it) and I tutor some. Great, right? Aside from my textbook over-achiever life, I'm also gay and depressed about it. I have no desire to be a homosexual, I never asked to be one, and would gladly trade it in for some other horrible defect. However, I am stuck with it. This is a problem, because my entire life focuses on two major goals: be active in Scouting and have a career in education. I can't do either one in my current state. Right now, consider yourselves quite privleged because you know more about my sexuality than even my parents do, and I really can't bring myself to tell them. For the past few months, I've started thinking more and more about really killing myself. I have perfect access to a gun, and I have also considered mixing aspirin and a few other things. I'm not prepared to face the remainder of my life, which could be quite long (I don't have any foreshadowing illnesses) as a gay man with no direction in life. I want to either achieve my two goals or forget about them and die. Am I shutting out my options? What AM I doing? I can consciously talk about this problem, but I don't even know what it is that's bothering me so much or how to go about solving it. All I know is that death would rid me of all these things. If I'm wrong, tell me so. I could use the information. I don't mind email, but replies are better. Any response would be appreciated. Thanks."

3056,Staging suicide as an accident?,Good evening everyone!
3057,i feel so alone and pathetic,I cant stop feeling like i am nothing and so useless my boyfriend says he just wants to be friends and i want more i really want him in my life and i know i cant change how he feels but i want to so much and being just friends would be so hard coz i want more and not having him in my life at all would be awful i just feel really alone and this has happened when everything seems to be so completely stuffed up i have no one in my life and i feel like i really dont want to feel like this anymore but i know i cant harm myself i cant do that to my family but i want to so much i just feel so completely lost
3058,I just wanted to be loved...that's all.,"I am 31 years old and I just don't want to be here anymore. Ever since I can remember I have been praying to die. I have been abused in every possible way by the people that were supposed to love me the most. Now that I am married I thought that I could put all of that behind me. My husband treats me badly. He hits me the way my father did. Choking me around my neck slamming my head up against walls. He verbally abuses me to. He cheated on me and he acts like he is very proud of it. He told me that he knows he can do it again and I will never leave him. He and the women he cheated on me with are still in contact. They call me and laugh at me because I am hurt and he says so what get over it. He also tells me daily that he does not want to be with me he wants a divorce. He has the resouces to get one but wont. I am believing that he says this to hurt my feelings. I really dont want to get divorced because I love him. Maybe I am stupid. I don't trust him or anyone else, because when I do people always end up using me and treating me badly. I am a good person with a good heart and I always treat people with respect and love. I just wish someone could love me. That's all I ever wanted was someone to love me. Love me not for what they can get from me or what I can do for them. I have some many times put people ahead of my own needs only to have them spit in my face. Maybe God does not want me or want me either that is why he hasn't answered my prayer. I was a little girl praying for him to take me away and he never did. He made me go through all that pain and now I am hurting again. I would be lying if I told you that I have not attempted suicide. I am thiunking about it right now. I am tired of people using me and yelling at me and treating me as if I have no feelings. My husband said that he has better things to do than worry about my stupid little feelings. Maybe my father was right..I was never gonna amount to anything. I should just end it myself and make everyone happier."
3059,"Got laid off, lost girlfriend, now losing house!","I got laid off the week before Christmas from a very good job that I thought would be safe. Got some severance pay, but it's all gone. Part of it was spent on helping my long-time girlfriend pay for her car repairs. Well... a couple of weeks ago, she dumped me - saying she needed to have her ""self-esteem"" back. It was a total surprise. I suspect she is dating another guy - she works at a store where she meets lots of guys. It hurts like heck, but I have no desire to find out. No desire to cling and beg either. I am too tired to deal with that crap, I have so much trouble focusing on finding another job. And then, with her gone, the house will soon be gone because I have no income. Unemployment is a joke and will run out very soon. As far as the job search, the competition is intense. I've been invited to only one interview so far, and it was a dud."

Im sure this kind of thing gets heard every day...well, I dont really care I guess. Im a nineteen year old college student, and I should be a happy, outgoing, person..like I used to be not so long ago. Three months ago (give or take), I began to experience strange feelings I had never felt before, I didnt want to leave my dorm room, i shunned my friends, I began withdrawing in general. There was no reason for these things to happen, they just did. I was the type of person I suppose most people in this kind of state despise. I was the quarterback jock in high school, very popular, always ready to party and hang with friends. Now, one year into college, I am on the brink of ending my life, for what reason I have no idea..all i know is that I have a pain inside of me that grows with each passing day, and no amount of medication, drinking, smoking, or partying will make it go away. My thoughts have been increasingly suicidal to the point where I wrote a six page suicide note last night."

3066,So many of you..are me,"It doesn't help though. It just makes me more sad to know life is unfair to so many people. I am so tired. So emotionally tired. I wake every morning in pain, going on only because I have to for my kids. I pray every day that today the hurt will stop, and it never does. It just keeps getting worse. In my mind I understand depression, stages of grief, yada yada....but that does nothing to help my heart. I thought, once, i had found the answer, i had found a happiness i could keep. Now i just feel like the butt of Go's jokes. I feel like I am being punished. Every move I make is wrong. Every attempt I make to heal only causes more pain. I am so ready to give up. I pray for death to take me while i sleep. I can't find the answers. People tell me they are within me...but i have looked, tried, they are not there. I am alone in the world save those two kids. They are the only reason i go on...and sometimes (and it only makes me feel worse) i resent having to go on for them. It's worse because I see those who hurt me go on to be rewarded with happy lives. They can go on and I am stuck...lost....trapped in my own grief and hurt and unable to fight my way out."

3076,Does my life have a purpose?,"I'm a 15 year old male. I've been taking anti-depressants since I was 13. I've always been afraid to say this but since my identity is concealed here, I will tell you that I'm gay. It's something that I've never been able to get over. I'm also extremely ugly & fat. I have no friends at school because I'm really shy. There was maybe one year in my life where I was happy and I had friends. It was like a year after I started taking my anti-depressants. But I was so stupid then and my friends weren't really into the whole girl thing yet. Now I still hang out with those same friends (like sit at lunch etc.) but I never talk now. They see me as some loser. They're always asking me 'would you hit that' and I always answer yeah. If they knew I was gay, it would be so much worse. I don't know if my parents know I'm gay. Sometimes I get the feeling they do. My parents are split up though. I live with my Dad and his girlfriend. I have a sister, a brother and a step brother. I don't really get along with any of them. Well sometimes we joke around but I can't actually hold a real conversation with any of them. Not even my Dad or his girlfriend. I can't hold a conversation with anyone actually. I'm always scared and when you scared while you talk, you can't think of anything to say. I have a really bad social anxiety disorder. So anyway, I've never had a girlfriend and I guess I have no friends either. I don't talk to anyone. All my teachers say I'm quiet and when they put the spotlight on me, I get so nervous. I hate going to school because I'm so ugly. I hate walking around where people can see me. I'd feel more comfortable wearing a paper bag over my head. I've tried to look better but everytime I try (to loose weight) I always fail. It never works for me. I have no job either. I spend most of my time on the computer. It really makes me angry when people tell me I have to try harder, get out more, go explore....i wish people would just realize that it's not that easy. There are so many things that will just end up stopping me from doing that. I've tried it. I'm scared now because I don't see myself going anywhere in the future. I hate when people say ""do you plan on having a family' and I can't have a family. I'm gay. Even if I decide to have one, nobody will accept it. And plus...how could I ever have a family being as anti-social and ugly as I am? So I think about killing myself a lot. Right now, I know deep down I wouldn't do it now because I'm afraid of death but I'm afraid that something is going to fuel me to really do it one day. The combination of problems I have isn't a good one. I mean sometimes I wake up and say to myself 'today I'm going to have a great day and change everything' but then you realize...what's the point? If I fix one thing, there are going to be so many things that I'll never be able to fix. EVER."
3077,Is death the answer?,"Life just sucks for me. My parents just yell all the time and never listen to what i have to say. life out side my house is so lonely even though someone of my so called friends ask me to go out i just feel like sitting at home feeling bad. i just sometimes want to kill myself but dont have it in me but i have so much hatred with in myself. i hate my life and i hate everyone around me. it seems my goal in life is to make everyone miserable around me. the other part is the question about god, does he really exist? Or is he just something that we can hold on to have hope that there is something after death. feel so alone....like one can feel the sadness the way i do..."

3083,i wanna die,"i wanna die cause nothing is worth living for right now...im thinking about hanging myself cause it seems like thats the only way ill be sure ill die...but i dont want my family to find me there hanging....especially not my mom....it really hurts to think about how she would react and feel when she sees me hanging there,dead.... so im just wondering if anyone can help me to find a way to die... a way that is easy and that definitely will kill me... a way that will be less painful for my mom... please someone help me i cant take it anymore"
3084,"Still fighting but very, very, tired of it all....","Hi, all:"
3085,I want to kill my stupid life.,"First i need to let everyone know what started my depressionl and i will do just that. I had a girlfriend i met on the internet about 5 years ago. Ever since then we've always saw each other every 4 months. She was my first girlfriend, my first love and i lost my virginity to her and the same goes with her too. I was her first everything. Things were going great up until july the 18th when she broke up with me. I begged and pleaded her not to and that i loved her with all my heart and soul. but she didnt seem to care. So 2 weeks goes by and i havnt really talked to her so i get this crazy idea and sell all my stuff and had my friend drive me to see her in arkansas. She then took me back and said she was impressed to see i would drive all the way to see her. So i stayed there for a month and my friend drove home back with his girlfriend that went with us. so on october the 5th i go home.November the 17th she tells me she wants to break up because of things arnt working out. before this 2 weeks she met this guy at this dance club. and has been hanging out with him. after the break up 1 week later she is going out with him....she tells me she is alot happier now that she doesnt have me in her life....ever since the breakup ive had feelings of guilt,depression,anger and suicide. I'm not doing very well at all. I'm always depressed and sad....i try to make friends with girls but they dont like me no girls like me im very ugly and sick looking. I dont have a car or anything so i can never go anywhere my whole life is crap. i have nothing going for me and i really hate myself for letting this happen...in which i mean letting her breakup with me. Its all my fault i let this happen and i just feel like punishing myself and try and kill myself for what happened. Now i cant be happy how could i be so stupid and let the best thing walk out on me? im very stupid and i hope i die real soon."
3086,im really scare!...can someone please help me,"Lastnight i was talking to my friend and i could tell something was wrong cause he wasnt acting like he normally does. I asked him whats wrong n he said nothing,so i was like ok and we talked for a little longer before i asked him again if he was sure nothing was wrong.He said he wasnt so i asked if he wanted to talk about it and he said maybe...not,but then he had to go.So i was talking to him again today and i asked if things were better.Of course,he said nothing was wrong,but i knew something was.He eventually told me there was,but he wouldnt tell me what it was. And then he got mad at me becuase i kept asking him to talk to me about it cause i care about him. Well he changed his name to ""Sometimes I cant take this place,sometimes its my life i can take"". This isnt the first time this has been his name.About a month or so ago was the first time i saw it. I asked him to promise me he wouldnt do something so stupid and he said no. I started to cry n asked him if he was seriously considering it and he said obviously.He wont tell me whats wrong,and he doesnt want to talk about it with me...what am i supposed to do?!If i dont know whats bothering him then how am i supposed to help. I dont want to bug him about telling me cause what if i make him mad and he kills himself,but i dont want to back off cause then he might think i dont care,and i do. Can someone please give me some advice on how to deal with this,and how i can help him get through whatever hes going through?I would appreciate it so much."
3087,I've been having suicidal thoughts lately,"Lately I've been depressed and have been having suicidal thoughts. Overall my life is good, I live on my own, I have a job and I'm going to school so overall life is good. The problem is that my love life is horrible. I'm 26 years old and ive never been on a date in my lfie and nver had a girlfriend. I'm too shy to approach girls and I look like one of those guys on ""Average Joe"". I am losing my hair, skinny, wear glasses and just feel like no girl would ever want to go out with me. I can't even look a girl in the eyes anymore. I have no self-esteem, no self confidence in myself and every girl and I mean every girl that I like and want to get to know more has a boyfriend and I'm getting to the point where i think that God created me to be single all my life and to never be in a relationship with a girl."
3088,i just want to disappear... forever,hi~
3089,Would any even care if I was gone??,"Hi, I just want to say thanks to any who is going to read this and try and help me out. It seems like right now my life seems so pointless. I have never been able tell someone who I really care how I feel that whats keeps holding me back and I don't what to do. I can't turn to my family because they don't understand.I am pretty much a loner even when Im with my friends or famliy I still feel like I completely alone espically at school. Since this September I thought my life was actually getting better now I have my doubts. I met a girl that I thought who was someone different because she was the first person in a long time to try and get to know me. I mean I want to get to know her but how do I do it when pretty much my whole life I felt like now one understands me. I try to have confiedence some friends and famliy said I should go into clubs like taking Martial Arts. I take"
3090,there's help if you want it.,"wow...this forum is so depressing. anyways, i haven't posted much here, even though i've been a member since august. oh well, i've got a great SI forum, if anyone is interested."
3091,require info on doctor procedures with attempted suicide,This isnt necessarily vital in terms of how some people require urgent help but it would be greatly appreciated if someone could help.
3092,Nothing seems to help,G'day
3093,"my first topic, please read it, and if you can/want reply","er hi, this is my 1st topic ive put up."
3094,Husband and Daughter having thoughts of suicide. Overwhelmed,"Feeling very overwhelmed with family problems. I feel like I'm trying hold up this huge weight all buy myself and if I drop it the family is going to be crushed. I'm a 35 yr old female with 4 kids. My husband is 38 and was diagnosed with 40% ptsd back in 1995. He can be a real bear most of the time. He has really bad outbursts when stressful situations arise and he can be really mean. Last month he threatened to kill his self. He took his gun from our closet and took off for 2 days. He was so mean about it. It wasn't like I'm so depressed I'm going to kill myself, it was like ""I'll show you and you'll feel bad for the rest of your life"". He even hand wrote out his will and gave it to me. I managed to get him home and calmed down and he seems o.k. but not better. He doesn't want to seek counseling for his depression because he doesn't like the fact that when he goes to the VA hospital and gets assigned a counselor that he only has that one for only 4 months and then they change counselors on him. He then has to go through his whole life story again and he said he's sick of it."
3095,what's the point of going on??,*sigh*
3096,I'm running on empty,"I'm 25 yrs old and I'm not really sure what's wrong with me. Every doctor seems to have their own diagnosis. The most recent is that I'm bi-polar with post traumatic stress. Another noted schizophrenia with pyschotic features. The Army disqualified me for being narsisistic. The only thing they all agree on is that I'm depressed and have been most of my life. I have a history of abuse in all it's forms,originally by my father,and later by foster parents. I've always felt like an ousider and still do. I'm constantly being judged and manipulated by people that dont/cant/wont understand me and have their own agenda,my interests not being part of it. I'm on medication that helps some days,but most not. I've never succeeded at anything despite my sincerest efforts,and my attempts at relationships all end the same way,with me driving/scaring people away. I'm sick of hurting,of failing,of not knowing when the depression is gonna hit. I'm thinking about killing myself pretty regular now. I've got a few family members that claim that I dont have the ""right to do that to them"",but I think that it's only about them. If they didn't have me to push around and take advantage of,they would have to actually get lives of their own. I dont believe they honestly care. Outside of them,I have no one. I dont matter. I'm not sure what keeps me hanging on,bull headedness perhaps,but that's about gone. I'm sick all the time now,I sleep too much because I dont have anything to get up for,and I no longer enjoy old pastimes. I'm desperate."
3097,it's time to be smart,"I have exhausted all options professional help , medication etc and yet nothing seemed to work. I have a feeling that it's only a matter of time before i resort to something in which i will end up in a whole heap of trouble eg resorting to drugs and that will get me into a lot of trouble with the authorities and my future will be forever ruined with a criminal record and i wil be physically prevented from killing myself in detention as well even though i want to do it desperately and police brutality is something that i have consider as well while in detention. I know very well that things are not gonna change and it is a sign of incompetence and stupidity when u give yourself a chance and see everything blown up in front of you eg i will be an idiot if i think positvely about the future when it is so overt that things are not gonna change. i dont think i deserve to be in this world for being so stupid either and i cant live with that coz i know very well that i am not and i think it's time to be smart and resort to the inevitable solution given all the possible scenarios. Some of you guys may perceive me as stupid for wanting to do the so called stupid and cowardly thing but it is really up to you i dont feel like disclosing some information about my background either"
3098,I'm just a body of diseases.,"Hi, I'm a new member here. I guess I'll give a little intro of myself. I'm 18 and am posting in this particular forum for obvious reasons. It's amazing I've actually not killed myself yet. In elementary school, I was always alone and wanted desperately to die. I started starving myself way back then. I still starve myself. The first time I tried to kill myself I was 15 in Germany on a foreign exchange trip. I tried to overdose but just ended up passing out. Last time I seriously attempted was 2 years ago. I tried to starve my body to death. I went several days with no water or food and was simultaneously working out every day. I'm not sure why it didn't work because I honestly don't remember what happened. A little over a year ago I met this ""great guy"" and was quite happy ... for a little while. It was only a few months before my depression came back. Then, I found out this guy wasn't as great as I had thought. We're no longer an item, but because of that, I'm in terrible shape. He was the only person I could talk to. I have no friends at all. I make small talk with people at work, but that's the closest thing I have to an actual friendship ... actually any sort of relationship whatsoever."
3099,I hate living,"I sit down here to write and I wonder why I am doing this. My life is a tragedy. Some people are just born with tragedy in their blood. The only reason I'm still alive is hope. I hope that things might get better. I don't know what is happening. My head just doesn't work right. I have never been happy. I wish I was happy. I am nothing! I try so hard to find happiness. I know I should be happy with what I have, but I hate living. I just don't want to live no more. The bitterness and anger inside me has made me hate everything. I destroy everything I touch. I can't eat. I can't sleep. I feel like I'm made of pain. My head is exploding. My brain is on the point of bursting to bits. I'm sick in the head. I feel like crap."
3100,he drove me to it,god damn that stupid jerk! i dont wana live but i cant bring myself to kill me... i loved him and he broke my hart. and with out him i am nothing i want to die i cant take this sadness IT DRIVING ME MAD!
3101,Why do we go on?,I can't work this life out anymore we go from day to day suffering and for what? If your depressed or suicidal your seen as weak.
3102,"suicide-a personal choice, not a wrong-doing.","Suicide is judged harshly and looked down upon. It is often seen as wrong, insane, and/or selfish. The world judges almost every incident the same, though every person is different, as are their reasons. I am hoping to offer a different view to this subject..."
3103,suicide vent,"I still hurt myself. I don't really know if I need it, and I don't care. Either way I'm still going to do it. I tried for a while to stop for the sake of others, but...I've lived for, through, because of others for so long that it's like I'm not really here, like everything I do feels wrong. I'm trying harder and harder to only use my knife on places that my parents won't see. I don't give a f___ if the guys see them. Because of not being able to cut on my wrist (the easiest place for me to make bleed, the first place my parents look for cuts) I cut more often and in bigger numbers. I feel like if they would just leave me alone, my cutting would almost disappear. There's no way they'll ever understand how much of a hell they've made for me."
3104,Im Done...not that you care,Okay I am now done with this life. Anyone who knows me knows I've been through more than anyone should ever have to go through but today is what made me decide on this.I was on a site and there was a poll on if I should kill myself.not only that 97% said yes.
3105,the usual teenage thoughts (i think??),"well...i think everyone has this thought during the teenage years of their lives, and im just going through teenage dilemma just like everyone else. i just want it to GO AWAY NOW!! anywhom...i've had these problems since the beginning of 10th grade and now im in 11th grade. i really don't want to go too deep into everything b/c then i would be writing a book. let's just say everything has just gone down the tube from the life i had of pretty much heaven. my attitude about life and everything has been gone forever. i used to be ALWAYS cheerful and happy and smiling. now i feel like death. i always feel like i want to die and when it's going through the worst times then i almost go through w/ it. the only thing that stops me is that i convince myself it will get better. but so many times have gone by i don't know if i can convince myself again that it will get better b/c it hasn't for so long. it's just gotten worst!! my b/f of over a year has ended for good b/c he's now moving to the other side of the state and i've lost a lot of close friends for many different reasons and i seem to feel unwanted. that's what gets me. my parents seem to not care about me. they go off and do their own thing and leave me to the damn computer home alone. then they yell and scream at me for some stupid i have no idea. they make me feel like crap. all my friends around me are going through harsh problems so i try to help them. everything is just horrible. i have bad self-esteem. i think im fat and ugly. i feel as though no one truly likes me. i just feel as though if i did go away for good that no one would care or mind even including my parents and sister. they already treat as though im not even there. what can i do to make myself feel better about myself?? im not really that independent, but i've become one since this has become in effect. im sorry if this was too vague. i just didn't want it to make it too long although it already is."
3106,"He's suicidal, I'm getting there as well. I fell helpless...","Hello everyone,"
3107,How do I cope with life,I dont know how much more I can take of this being alone in the world. My only friend (best friend) now doesnt even seem to care how I feel. Everyone here thinks I am being selfish because I wont let his girl friend control his life. If you want more insight on what I am talking about you can look back in my post history for a better idea and to also call me selfish if you want.
3108,R U thinking about commiting suicide? first read this!!!,well do im tell u im 13 and i thought about it and im tellin u it wont do N.E.thing just stick around things will get better take me for instance 7 grade i wans small un noticed had 1 friend no girl liked me couldnt get a GF and people would say hurtful things to me well now im 8th grade i got every girl checkin me out i got a GF i have like 100 friends out of a skool wit 850 im noticed and im the 3 most popular boy in skool now all i get is positive words from people
3109,im gona die who da hell will notice,"Hey everyone,"
3110,finally,I can't stand this! I am going to finnally go through with it. Maybe tonight or tomorrow in school- or soon.
3111,just broke up with my gf after 5 years,ya I feel like killing myself. I already slit my wrists and dranks some alcohol with a couple pills. I'm trying my best to go away from this world.
3112,Just another confession,"I found this message board by shear coincidence and read some of the threads on suicide. It is both sad and comforting to realize just how many people out there face the same dilemma and heartache, though might have been caused by a different reason. I’m very much familiar with the overwhelming sense of self-unimportance and guilt a lot of you describe in their posts. My story is banal and has nothing new to offer, but sometimes it is nice to be able to have someone listen."
3113,i cant take it anymore,"my mom died form a rare form of stomach cancer about a month ago. She was the only thing I had in my life. since she died i have nothing. I have 2 brothers who i dont talk to and a dad who i hate. My parents marriage was awful to begin with there would be a fight everyday he would throw things and jsut scream. When she was dying all he did was argue with her and now thats shes dead all he does is talk crap about her in front of me. None of my friends understand at all they can;t relate to me and they don't no how to act. My other family i don't feel connected with at all. My life is jsut like this huge black hole that i cant get out of im doing horrible in school, i odnt want to talk to friends, or go out. Im sick of hearing it will get better i duno maybe it will but all i no is for right now life is soo s***** i dont think i can last much longer. help me"
3114,i can't live anymore,"when i post, someone usually says something like ""it's up to you"" or soemthing like that. and you know they're probably right. but what do you do if you are doing everything like say...not trying to kill yourself and it doesn't matter? then what? let me say this: God made me by accident. and for that, i hate him. i didn't ask to be bornnor did i ask for such a worthless life at that. see...i did my part this morning. i got up, walked 2 miles to school and i tried to talk to the girl that i like. let me just explain as someone with no reason to live, i have a hard time opening up to people in person or over the phone. this girl i've been talking to since april has a boyfriend. yeah i know...""you shouldn't try go after her"" well you know what...it's too late to just turn off my feelings like i'm soemkind of robot! once again, all i asked from God was to make this go right. not please make her my wife or please make her fall madly in love with me...just help me get through my worry and pain of past heartache. but did he care? or course not. that's cause he was busy helping out other people like jerks who pick on other kids in school but all the good things happen to them. or those thugs like tupac who everyone treats like he was jesus, which for all i know he probably was. he doesn't have time for a piece of crap like me. but once again i didn't ask to be born, so it's his mess not mine. i try REALLY hard everyday so it's not like i'm complaining for nothing. it's not just the girl, it's me as a human in this world of billions. if i died no one will care and that really hurts. i cried today because i'm slowly realizing this may be the end. and if i don't kill myself, i'm gonna get far away from mainstream society since i don't belong anywhere around it."
3115,I have no reasoon to live!! somebody please help !,"for about 5 1/2 years now i've been really depressed..it all started when my parents broke up on my 8th b'day..since then i've had a record of 560 suicide attempts and too mnay to count emoptional breakdowns...getting out of bed is like climbing mount everest for me, it's hard and takes me along time to actually be able to persuade myself to get up. Getting ready for school is even harder, then actually going is even harder than that. i'm 13 yrs old and have one or two friends who i can really trust..infact they're the only ones that talk to me and i've known them for a year now."
3116,No going back need help!!!!!,i want to commits suicide i dont want any one to tell me i am making a mistake i just want some advise all i nedd is a way to kill myself with out hurting my mum/ sister the least i dont want them to have to clean me up or any thing i was thinking poision was the best way i dont mind how much it hrts weather its quick/slow just clean thanks Adam
3117,No point anymore,Why do I find life always so hard?
3118,I am strongly considering suicide......,"Hi, my name is Lucy and i have posted here before. Well.....the problem is that I want to commit suicide more then ever now and I am only 18 yrs old. I can't focus, everything in life is so blurry, I haven't accomplished anything, I don't really have many friends, and i can't trust anyone anymore. I don't feel much of anything except for extreme sadness and depression. I really, really want to die. I have prayed several times to God to end my life during my sleep, but my prayer isn't being answered. I don't want to do it myself because I will go to hell if I do even though I have not been a religious person in a while. I also am extremely unhappy at home and want to get out of here. I have tried given life a chance a couple of years ago, but right now I wish i didn't. This awful pain is killing me slowly day by day. What should i do? I am at the brink of doing something."
3119,What is the best way to do it?,"i am 28, i have terminal brain cancer with about 6-12 months to live"
3120,i hate myself and want to die...,"hate myself and want to die...(nirvana rules ) i have no reason to live, my life sucks... i wish i would just die, i wanna go to sleep and never wake up. i hate waking up, i feel sick. i hate myself, i tried to kill myself a few times but i can't even do that right, i tired to get help once but it didn't work out. the sad part about everything is that when i tired to kill myself and failed i felt sad becuz i didn't die. i tell my mom all the time that i wanna die, but she just gets mad at me and walks away, my brother knows i wanna die too but he just jokes about it... i see nothing funny about it. im tired of asking for help no one cares so i should just end it, i have no reason to live. im not scared to die, i wanna die. i have always been sad even at a young age when i was younger like 7 i use to write suicide letters.... now im 16 going on 17 and i still wanna die... my brother bought a gun so im thinking about going over their and when he's not looking i can go get it and blow my head off, hopefully i will die... with my luck i'll prolly live . im just a waste anyway, i don't do anything, no one needs me, everyone will ge over it... besides i've told everyone i was gonna do it so their will be no surprises anyway if u ppl have any advice for me e-mail me or whatever, but hurry if your gonna do it cuz i don't plan to be around much longer bye now"
3121,i think i might hurt myself tonight,"i think i might hurtr myself tonight. ive drank a 5th of gin and im pretty drunk. i dont know what i might do... im SERIOUS. THIS IS NOT soleley for attention, i swear... i feel like life has messed me up... i guess thats all that i hav to say....thanks"
3122,the end is near,"I once posted a message here reguarding that I have never been with a woman, even at 42 years old I still am a virgin well as my last message before I leave this planet I would like to say that the advice that was given was wrong that is what has led me to make this decision I guess after tonight I wont have to live with this on my shoulders any more. If you were one of the people that gave advice I hope you never have to give advice to some one again when some one asks to be listened to do it and dont offer suggestions on how to fix it because thats not were looking for. I struggled long and hard about what I am about to do my mind is made up so as I end this life just a suggestion if you see some one in despair listen to them and dont offer remedies we arent asking for that so long and see you in the next life"
3123,what happened suidide is not the answer,Recently my brother was on this site seeking help with a problem I believe it may have been about woman and his inability to meet any our family never new how unhappy he was till this weekend when he committed suicide I wish he had said how much it bothered him but we werent very close I guess he couldnt face the fact that for some reason woman were not attracted to him I would always laugh at his experiences on the net in trying to find a girlfriend little did i know how much it bothered him and the hurt he felt when he would get no responses from the emails he sent. well I just hope that he is in a better place now with out the pain he felt paul I will miss you.

3128,suicide,"i hate my life and i just want to end it all. but i know if i do i'll hurt someone close to me. i cant deny the feeling though, what should i do?"
3129,I just dont want to live in this world anymore....,"Hi all. I found this forum today simply because i was bored and i typed in : I just want to die. And i found you guys. I dont know what to do anymore... I am 23 and a nobody, doing nothing with my life, i keep running into dead ends. I am a single mother (the father ran off to become a heroin addict, bum, and ) and ive been through three abusive relationships in a row (and the one im currently in is being worked on, but its livable). I live with my father and we are extremely poor, and he is an alcoholic and does drugs, and i cant stand having my son around it, not to mention all he does is rage and scream all the time. I dont know what to do.. I cant get an apartment because i have a warrant for my arrest and i have bad credit and rental history... Ive tried soooo many times at complexes AND through independent renters, and to no avail. All I want to do now is straighten my life up but there is no way to climb out of the hole i am in.. i got a car but i cant get a license because of the warrant, and i cant pay it off, and im afraid ill lose my son if i go to jail. He is the only thing other than my boyfriend that keeps me somewhat sane. I am also diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and have an eating disorder. I think the best thing to do is just end everything, but then im afraid of what will happen to my son. There is no way out for me, and im hopeless. Ive tried government agencies, who just laugh at me basically... i dont want to go back to being homeless on the streets, not with my baby. But i just cant stay here and i have no options anymore I just want to die. Thanks for listening."

3135,I FEEL LIKE COMMITTING SUICIDE,"I am a 26 yrs old man but there is absolutely nothing for which I can love myself. I have learned that everybody has some quality in him/her self. But I could not find any in myself. Even if I have anything, that is not of much to talk about. I am physically not much strong and always suffering from some kind of physical problems…sometimes from cough & cold, sometimes from anal fissure, sometimes from flatulence. I am also not very energetic. As far as quality is concerned, I have nothing much to talk about. I cannot play musical instruments, neither I am a good singer, I am not good in sports, I was a always an average student in my school and college, I don't have any artistic skill, I can swim but not a good swimmer. Even I don't know what exactly my hobby is and which career choice is best choice for me. Whenever I try to make a choice, everybody says that I am wrong and don't know anything. Finally either I succumb to their pressure or end up doing nothing."

3142,I Just want to Die!!!,
3143,A little about me as usual...,"I am beginning to think that life is hanging on a delicate thread, one change in life can bring about disaster. I realised this luckily when I was in double IT, the lucky thing was that I could not do any thing about it because I had no razor to hand. I have several times considered the art of slashing my wrists and have always managed to talk my self out of it, however today I only saw the advantages of it and I believe it may be profitable to the world if i performed my duties"
3144,PLEASE help... suicidal friend...,My friend called me just now...
3145,not 19 yet and thinking about suicide,"I am turning 19 on sept. 29 and not sure if i want to live to see my birthday. There is too much pain in my life and i don't care to feel anymore. All i feel is agony and pain. My heart is already shredded into little pieces and there is no cure. My mom is emotionally unstable because my dad is still cheating on her. She constantly yells at me and my brother. My dad is just a psycho that don't bring much money home because he is taking care of his other family. My mom doesn't want to divorce him. After i moved because of my mom not working because of my dad, i have left my old neighborhood and my friends. My best friend had to move away to florida because she has a baby. i have been with the same guy for almost 3 years, the only thing that keeps me alive so far. We haven't been in a very good relationship for a year and a half and argue constantly. We also had done things that hurt each other (not intentionally). My boyfriend already has his life set. I feel like a burden because i feel i am slowing him down and i know sooner or later he is going to leave me again. I love this guy to death though. i feel as though i have nobody and is being punished for something. basically, i have no friends, no family, no soul mate, and no future (didn't finish highschool). I am also dillusional and i keep thinking that i am not in my own body and keep thinking that i had a body switch or something. Please don't laugh, this is some serious stuff. I feel as though i am going insane. i am always nervous, anxious, fearful, and depressed. i hate myself, i hate my family, and i hate everybody almost. most of all i hate my mind and my so called useless piece of nothing life. i seriously am considering about suicide. i have throughout the summer, and my mental image of everything is basically psychotic. i want to jump off the roof and land on a car to show everyone the pain i feel. i don't even know who i am anymore anyway. i know i belong in a mental institute and actually don't mind going. but with what money? if god can only take my soul from my body and let me die a peaceful death."

3147,suicide,"I need help like a lot of help. I am think about suicide...well for a long time now. But if i sit down and think about i don't think that i want to die but i have no pros and my cons i don't know what to do. i want to tell my parents because i know that i need help and i want to get help but see the thing is if i don't get help i know that my head is going to take over and i know that something is going to take pleace weather it be killing myself or trying to kill myself can someone please give me any ideas to tell my parents that i am thinking about suicide. like when i get really mad at them and want to just wish that they weren't there i think about saying it then like ""OMG and people think I'm just kidding when i say i seriously want to commit suicide"" or something like that so and someone please give me some ideas on how i can get help and or how i can tell my parents so that they cab get me help?? thanks"
3148,thinking about killing myself,Ok i'm back. Some people is wondering why i am thinkin about doing that. Well i have tried to kill myself 2 times by cutting my wrist really deep. But it never happened. But here is why i wanna do that. 1. because my dad never comes around and i feel like its my fault because i was a bad kid. 2. because in the past 3 years i have had 2 friends and 3 family members die. 1 of my friends shot herself in the head. because she was on drugs real bad and she didn't have no other way out. 3. because i got kicked off the softball team and the person that told was one of my good friends. 4. because i think i'm gay 5. because i just hate my life and i don't wanna be here no more. When i was in 1st grade my teachers would send notes home asking my mom if when of my pets have died because i look so sad all the time and i think its because i'm depressed. I thought after i move to another school and make new friends that everything would be ok but its not. i just don't know what to do anymore so somebody please help me
3149,someome explain to me the point.,"yeah, can't say i ever actually wanted to be alive, no particular reason, i'd just rather be dead, (really i wish i hadn't been born, but that's a little trickier to accomplish) anywho, i don't understand the problem so many people have with suicide.i mean i understand that someone would obviously miss a loved one if they died, but yoou should try to understand, that that's what that person wanted/needed.that person may feel they are a particularily selfish,ignorant,negative,unpleasant,etc. person, and don't want to be the one who's slowly but surely destroys not only themself, but the lifes of everyone they care about through their negativity etc."
3150,Theres no point anymore,This post is a little long but I had to write this down and hopfully some one could give me some helpful advice
3151,I don't want to die...im so scared,My names John and im losing it. I dont want to die. I contemplate suiside all the time and fear one day im going to do it. My friends are all trying to help but nothing is working. Neither of my parents know and i can't tell them. They would freak out too much. I just feel like im a burden to everyone...like no one wants me around because of how i am. Truth is i need people around me...I need my friends with me...i Need to find sumone who will be here to help me. But i cant. The doctors cant help me. Im just so scared that im going to lose control again...I have before. I have cut myself and walked out infront of traffic. When i do this i cant stop myself. I dont expect anyone to understand coz i dont think that anyone does. I just dont want to die. I dont want to lose control. Im so scared.
3152,for those about to die...read this first,I am not in a down or suicidal mood now so now would be a good time to make a post on reasons people should not do so. This may seem hypocritical because i have attemped before but if my post helps just one person decide not to end it all then i know i will have made an impact in the world.
3153,My Last Resort: Suicide,"Okay,"
3154,I just don't get it.,I just trying to vent a little here. I have these constant up and downers one minute high as a frikon kite the next I have real thoughts about killing myself over the slightest little thing.
3155,driven to suicide by debts and likely relationship breakup,"i am contemplating taking my life, sooner rather than later"
3156,this is goodbye...hopefully,"Here is just another suicide post. You don't have to take your time to read it but I just wanted to let it all out. I hate school, and I am in until May. I hate pretty much everyone, and everything. I can't go to school, it sucks so flipping bad. There is no way to describe it. It's not just school it's everything. I HATE LIFE!"
3157,My bf is going to dump me becuz i wanna kill myself...,"im in a really bad mood today and i really really dont know why. I told my bf that im not in the mood to be messed with beczu he was saying some crap. So we got into this fight and hes like well i dont see why we are even going out if ur gonna kill yourself. I really like him and i dont wanna loose him! but things are tough to handle and i cant totally explain stuff. but i feel that if we break up tht it might get worse, he says: its hard to go on with u when ur always talkin about killin urself and cuttin urself and stuff like that cuz it makes me feel like im doin something wrong. Well hes not doing something wrong, i mean when i feel suicidal and then when we are together that all goes away. i need some help fast on what to do! please if any of that made any sense and u can help, please do!!!"
3158,why am i here?,"i often feel like there is no point to my life. that i would be much better off dead. and i am so bitter about everything: past relationships, how my parents talk to me. i constantly vow that i will never fall in love again. and i cannot talk to anyone about this. my parents would freak out. the counsellors and psychiatrist i see would call the police. and well, friends are non existent. my only solace are these piles of books in my room that i don't read and dvds that aren't even out of their original packaging. anyway, my point is, there doesn't seem to be any point to my life. i am very much alone and any efforts i do make to relieve me of my loneliness is usually interrupted with school. i try to volunteer for things, and no one needs me, or the schedule is different from when they need people and when i get time off from school. i try to get some exercise, and homework needs to be done. anyway, i see no point in living anymore, and i often wake up depressed before the day has even begun. i pray to god and chant to buddha and nothing seems to come of anything i do to help myself. i often wish that i was dead, so that i wouldn't have to feel so alone and sad anymore."
3159,The Dirty Little Secret,"I have someone close to me, who is dealing with a suicide. Recently someone close to them killed themself. And it has been decided that the suicide is to be kept a secret from as many as possible. (Some may not be happy that I know, as I am not family). I have no issue with the neighbors not knowing. But I plan on taking issue with the person I am close with about a decision not to tell younger family members."
3160,Can depression be avoided?,".This is the story. I am 24 years old, and I have taken anti-depressants from age 19 to 23. That means I have been living without any medicine for a year, I have had ups and downs, but usually things were normal. However, for about a month I feel depressed, my counsellor says that I might take medicine, but I am not sure. I know that the possibility of getting into depression is higher if one has had a past experience, but I also think that medicine is not always the right solution."
3161,Goin off the deep end....,"My dad and me aren't getting along. Its more like he hates me and all he ever does is complain about how much he hates himself and he complains about a lot of things ...He blames me on taking his pills and being in his room going through his stuff when i DONT!,....Hes real paranoid and i hate"
3162,clearly thinking of doing the 'dreaded deed'....,"Ermmmm hi,well i guess I'm here for one reason...as u can all guess."
3163,i just want to end my life now!!im sick of all the drama....,"I kno u hear the expression ""well life will get better, just wait"" well not for me i dont kno how much more i can take of this. all of it. i just wanna take a gun to my head and end it while i still have the chance. Im sick so sick so weak. I tried to change my life around. i really did gave it many of many efforts an still its seems as if no matter what i do is hopeless. im scared of what may happen. i dont wanna be alive anymore to find out thou. i have been getting these terrible nightmares. my friends all of them backstabbed me and talk smack. all i wanna do is cry. i even tried to stop smoking, but i gave into today aftera week of smoking and had one. i feel like hell now cuz of that. IT just feels like i dont have a meaning anymore. as if im not even wanted. all of my friends who i thought were there for me seems as if i meant nothing too them. Most teens my age are out drinking haveing fun. but i had to mature alot faster then any of them .and u know it sucks i never had the chance to be a kid. not really. so whats the point. why should i keep living on if nothing is gonna change. i have this guilt so strong in my stomach thats eating me alive. i hear this voice in the back of my head saying end ur life do it now b4 u really mess up ur life. i just am about to do it. i have no other chance. i dunno any help too ppl that used to be in my place and made it. i just am a failure..............."
3164,those who wish to die: READ,"Sorry it's written this way, but there were too many posts recently to individually comment that way. So i want you all, everyone out there who wants die to read this. Also, please know, anyone, i dont care who you are, anyone can please msg me if you ever need to talk. i'm serious. i may not be the best help out there, but i'll try and do everything in my power to get you through this and help you realize that life is in fact worth living."

It's a confidence issue stemming from suicidal depression when i was 15, plus i have a few medical worries atm.. waiting on the blood test... trouble passing water etc... anyway back to the depression, i pulled out of it when i was around 16 but it still scars me, it was an amazingly powerfull force on my mind, and i appreciated the help my Dad gave me back then."
3169,death flowers have the sweetest scent,"im sick of this world, most of all im sick of me, well not me but the thing tht hides me which wont budge. i wish i knew who i was. too late now anyways. bye"
3170,Can't stop thinking like this...,"This is so unlike me, but lately I've been having these thoughts of killing my self, mostly with a knife in my kitchen, or maybe jumping from my balcony...I am on the 9th floor."
3171,QUESTION ok if i cut my throat with a knife how long would,it take to kill me?
3172,"I dont know if I'm Suicidial, or am I just emotional?",
3173,"You won't cry for my absence, I know","Please, please forgive me,"
3174,Suicide + Money,"Quick question... What are the laws about what happens to someone who commits suicide's debt? Say I committed suicide and had £10,000 worth of debt, would my family be responsible for repaying it or... what? Obviously it must have to be paid somehow otherwise all people who commit suicide would go out and spend spend spend on their last day."
3175,Dont want to be here anymore..,I want to slip away and not come back. Fall asleep and not wake up.
3176,I can't MAKE him,My husband is increasingly suicidal. It's getting worse and worse. He has highs and lows. His lows are getting lower every time. I am afraid to leave the house to go to work and am afraid I will lose my job if I don't. (he is not working).
3177,how do i cope and why should i cope? i prefer to end it all,hi how doi start this theres no real way of coming out this because of all the shame and embarrassment as well as hurt i'm feeling...i have already tried to commit suicide i took 15 pills and was rushed to the emergency room by myfather....... my stomach was pumped and i had to stay in the hospital for 4 days.... i was not allowed to discharge myself or be discharged.... i thouhht i learnt my lesson but the hurt still remains i can't get over the didfficulties in my life i never get a break i get hurt and embarrassment in aspect of my life... i'm 17 yrs old and i cant find any resaon to live jus 17.....my bf does not care 4 me cause he has no time 4 me.. my parents do not hav a good marriage and i lack any kind of social life or peers... i'm come to a cross road in my life its either i try to
3178,My Plan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Scenario 1
3179,friend having a rough period,"i have a friend who recently e-mailed me about her depression. she told me a little about it and she also told me that she had gone to a psych ward for 3 weeks back in may becuase of her depression and suicidal thoughts. she told me that she was becoming suiciadal again, but not actually wanting to kill herself. she says she had lost any inclination to live on."
3181,head like a target...,"Greetings, I havent posted in Oh so long. i wish i was back on happier circumstances.Regardless im back and willing to help in anyway for anyone"
3182,advice needed fatal combination of anti depressants,"I'm really sick of this freaking life and it's time for the inevitable. I have a combination of anti depressants anti psychotic 5 or 6 different ones. aropax, luvox, avanza Prozacc zoloft adn sleeping pills. Any advice on the most lethal combination will be very helpful. thank you."
3183,The question could really be the answer,"People say that if someone is really going to commit suicide that they won't tell anyone beforehand... they will just do it, and maybe leave a note behind. However if they aren't serious they will tell people to bring attention to themselves... Do you guy's agree? Do the majority of people that go ahead and do it actually let people know? Or not..."
3184,I have the knife to my wrist,"I reallly can't take it anymore!! everything in my life seems to go downhill..girls, love, my music, my job. I feel so alone. All of my friends are busy and I've lost friends because I'm always depressed. I threaten to kill myself when a girl hurts me or rejects me and I'm sick of it. ""you're just too good enough for me"" or I just wanna be friends"" or ""you're just too nicce of a oerson"" the girls say to me all the time. This is all bull$#$#"
3185,can't see any other way out,"everything is wrong. i don't have any friends anymore, i am madly in love with a girl who is not interested, my studies have gone out the window, my drinking out of control."
3186,Good Bye all,"well i just writing this cus this will be the last thing i say or do. im now going to end my life for the best, to all my friends dont cry just be happy, i love yous all but i just dont want yous to see me down like i am now, i have been faking a smile fo a long time hoping i will feel better soon but i am worse than ever. i have the gun ready now i just need to pull the triger. there is nothing in this world that can make me happy again, im sick of crying every night, im sick of been like this, im sick of life, so i love yous all, good bye"
3187,hi,"I'm only 14 years old (nearly 15). I have a boyfriend who is nearly 18, thought that getting an older boyfriend would solve my one of my problems, but its just made me realise something else. To most people I have a great life, friends, nice house, parents are together, and don't no anything about how I really feel."
3189,i wanna die,Kita - why am i sti
3190,emergency! how do i stop him?,"my bf and i r very close. we love each other 2 death... and we rarely fight. we've had discussions of marraige and sending our lives together so there is no question about hwo much we love eachother. howver, the other day we got into an argument because for some reason out of the blue after i thought all was good, these doubts i guess had been building up inside my bf and he just started telling me he didnt believe i loved him and he just had so many doubts and he just started saying he was a bad bf for me. i have no clue where this came from. hes a great bf and i love him 2 death and show it all the time.. i dont really know why he doubts our relationship out of no where. anyway, this conversation escalated inot the possability of a break up and he freaked out, said he had a knife beside him and said he couldnt live w/o me and so he was just going to kil himself. i heard him scream and hang up. i freaked out and called him back. luckily he answered but im scared that if by chance things somewhere down the road dont work out or we fight again he'll do something stupid like that. how do i stop this? hes just recently started cutting and he wont tell me why. everything seems so great and happy when we're together but i dont understand where his doubts are coming from and more than anything i just need a way to make sure if we do ever fight again he doesnt go kill himself."
3191,one more cut will live the rest of my life...,"hey, i really need help, i can't take this no longer i've tryed and tryed i have no one to call no friends near by i have NO ONE! all i have got is the computer, i've lost everything, my boyfriend, my friends gave up on me, and my family wouldn't even notice if i wasn't here. and people wonder why i'm upset, i have a track record of being suicidal, i tryed to kill myself and ended up in hospital over 3 times in the past two years and OD all the time, all drugs are removed from my house incase."

3194,I don't know?,Well this seems like a good place to talk about all this pent up anxiety I have. Its just I pretty much wanna die....wanna kill myself. I think about it every single day and I wish I could do it.
3195,He Saved Me But Now What??,"I attempted suicide last Tuesday night and was saved by my boyfriend. Not very sure of the details - all that I know was that he called my GP and counselor, the counselor came over, and they decided to call for an ambulance to send me to the hospital."
3196,Friend talks about killing himself...,I have a friend who has a lot of mood swings. A few days he's happy and seems to have a lot of confidence and then for the next few weeks he's upset and moody and says he just thinks he should off himself. I can't tell if he's serious or not.
3197,What makes you want to?,what makes people want to commit suicide?
3199,Scared of myself,"So as the title suggests, I've been scaring myself as of late. I was never one to even consider suicide or running away...but last Sunday I started to run away (my brother happened to phone me and stop me at the time), and the next day I wanted to just end it all, but I tried to get help instead. I had my brother take me in to see a therapist, which I'm now seeing every Friday."
3200,what is happening,"hi i dont know why but all i want is to die, i have tried to kill myself a few times before but i am still here. i hate how this world is alot of people dont even care about the people on the other side of the world who desnt even have a roof overthere head and they go to bed hungry, the world is spose to be about careing but no one cares where ever i go people is treating other kids like crp. friends come and go, well i dont even know if i can say i have ever had a real friend in my life they just turn there back on ya. and there is one thing i cant stand and that is people who rape people that makes me so darn sick how can you hurt someone so much, people that get raped never get over it, it sticks with them for life. maybe in complaining to much but all of this just makes me think there is no point in even living."
3201,Trust issues bringing me down,"Hey well i do have an active account on here but there is some things i dont want my old friends to know. Well see i am suicidal and at this very moment life seems so unbearable im about ready to give up. I have spoken to only one person about just how bad it is, just one person. But still i cant open up to them. Im so scared of getting hurt, im scared of even my very best friend who is like a sister. I dont trust anyone. My friends have told me they no longer even try to talk to me because they no i wont tell them anything. One of my great friends told me that she can only joke when shes around me or talk about her problems because if we get to close to my life i just put up some sort of wall. Which is true. Im making others feel like failed friends and no matter how bad that makes me feel i still cant talk to them. My cuttings getting worse and i know that soon i'll give up if i dont get the help i need, yet how can i get help if i wont talk???? Please does anyone have an ideas on how to get over this???"
3202,Please Help!!! Asap!,"I just got a call about a half hour ago from my ex-girlfriend that just broke up with me this last week. One of our friends we haven't seen in a year came down this last weekend when I went up and got him and he had a blast this weekend. He tried calling me tonight, but I was on the phone and I ignored it like I do to anyone that interrupts an important call. I got a call from my ex-girlfriend and she told me I needed to call him right away. That he was balling and crying like she had never heard before, and she couldn't even understand a word he was saying. I called him and he was in really bad shape. He had just punched out a window and cut his hand on the glass, I made sure it was okay and not a severe wound and it wasn't. All I could hear him say was ""I'm so scared of what I might do to myself, and I really dont want to."" He comes from a family whose father walked out on them and whose mother was very abusive. He lived down here in the cities and that's how I met him. He had to move back up north because of living expenses that he couldn't come up with anymore. He's so bent out of shape, because people are telling him to give up and that he's not worth anything, and anything he does is a waste of time. Mind you, he hasn't been suicidal since before he met me and my girlfriend - he told me we are basically his only family."
3203,needing some help,"I feel more lonely right now than I ever have before. my boyfriend, who is pretty much my only friend in the city I live in is leaving for a month and I am so afraid of being by myself for that long, and I am afriad that I will feel so sad and alone that I will harm myself in some way. my friends from my hometown never talk to me anymore and I dont want to live with this pain anymore. I dont know how to fix anything and everytime I try I fail. I dont want to die but I don't want to keep on living like this. I need help but I really dont have any friends anymore. therapy isnt helping either I still hate myself more than ever and I feel like nothing is ever going to get better."
3204,the last rant ?,"i`m sorry but this may ramble a bit. i`m in another depression. i think i`m hitting bottom. this could be good , after all there`s no way but up at that point , right? no , i could get stuck here. that`s not living. i`ve led a closed ,horribly closed ,cut off existence. my parents , who are gone now, were too damn old, repressed,bitter and unhappy to raise a child. my mother was over-protective,my father was emotionally distant and happy to leave me with my mother. he would never admit to it though , he did everything he was supposed to do.....he paid the bills. i`ve touched on most of this in previous posts. in some other posts on the suicide topic someone mentioned ""steps"" one goes through in life. i never took those steps. i think i stopped growing emotionally at 12. adolescence , time to begin the separation from parents. i couldn`t do it. i got no help,no encouragement. i never really did break away. i don`t even know my real self. all my reactions are based on my based on my weird,scared upbringing."
3206,Someone please help me,"Sorry i really cant believe i am posting this, i really didnt want to but i had to let out how i feel. I just dont see a point in life anymore, i am sick of living in pain and getting hurt all the time. Everyone around me knows there is something wrong with me, my boss at work has notice, the people i work with, my mother, my sister and my brother."
3207,Fate,"At the age of 8 I grasped the concept of suicide and realized that that would bring the relief I so desired. ""Clinical depression"" the doctor said. From 8 to 14 I practiced writing suicide notes on and off and trying to decide the right way to do it. At 14 I chose to consume a half bottle of acetaminophen thinking that would do it. God I was stupid. I did my research and at 16, I took a full bottle of prozac, a bottle of welbutrin, a bottle of buspar, a bottle of trazadone, as well as lacerating both wrists. I wrote, ""I can't take it anymore"" on my bedroom floor with my own blood as the world started turning gray. I succeeded only to be resuscitated."
3208,I need to know how to help myself.,"Im depressed at the moment, I've been depressed for the past two years really, its only recently ive realsied that i am, reading this forum has helped. Since my dad commited suicide 2 years ago, its really just gone down hill from there. I was really fine with it when it happened. I found the best way of dealing with it was to just ignore it, lot of good thats doing me now, just a few weeks ago, its all come crashing down. I just cant deal with life."
3209,Have you ever contemplated suicide for this reason?,"Suicide has only crossed my mind this year for a few months, went away, and has now come back very mildly. This is the only reason why I even consider suicide: Going thru the rest of my life without finding my true love/soulmate."
3210,the score,I hate my job. I hate every job I have ever had. I hate every job I see advertised. I hate every class I have ever been forced to take. I hate every class I have ever chosen to take. I mildly dislike my parents. I hate every after-school activity my parents have ever signed me up for.
3211,Life without love feels meaningless,"I feel like I'm living in a foreign country everyday, surrounded by people who speak another language. They can't understand me and I can't understand them. I feel alone. Lately, the only peace I get comes from hiding in movies or work. I exercise a lot but yesterday, at the school's fitness center, I ran into the girl I became friends with last year, fell in love with, was bluntly rejected by, and soon after hated by. I am hated by everyone there now too - a place I have to attend for two more years. They all look right through me as if I am not there. Elaborate thoughts of how to end my life occupy my mind. If I were with a therapist, he or she would ask me if I had a plan (just as their manuals tell them to ask), and if I were to be honest with them, I would say yes. I would say a closed vehicle, carbon monoxide released via the combustion of coal. I would say that detectors with three digit digital readouts are readily available at any hardware store. The problem is that such detectors have only three digit readouts and I would have to take readings from outside the car and produce some sort of algorithm by taking measurements over time to predict how long it would take for the inside of the car to have 6800 ppm of carbon monoxide so that I would fall asleep in less than 30 minutes."
3213,Friend commited suicide...,I'm having a very hard time dealing with the suicide of my friend. he took his life on monday and everyday i seem to feel worse. I wasn't very close with him but we had partied together afew times and he had asked me out for dinner afew times but i didn't because i was dating someone else at the time.
3214,If your SO tried to commit suicide...,How would you react? What would you do?
3215,...too much pain.... too much...,"I thought I could live with knowing that she didnt love me anymore, but I was wrong... my life no longer holds any meaning for me. The only thing keeping me from going and killing myself right now is the promise she made that we would get back together over the summer...."
3217,I shouldn't be feeling this way...,"There is nothing wrong with my life. I know I can have a bright future, I have wonderful friends and a mostly supportive family. I am relatively smart, not unattractive. There is nothing wrong with me physically. What is wrong with me is mentally."
3218,I have something to admit.,"Hi,"
3219,Still need to do it,"Yeah, I still desperately want to off myself. I've realized that I'm a waste of tissue and water and have done nothing but (against my will) hold other people back and influence decisions that people don't want to make. I'm nothing but a mass of body parts and recessive garbage genes."
3220,I feel like I am just done with everything,"I have never felt this low in my life. Thoughts of ending it all keep popping up in my head. I have had such a hard life. I know l can't be the only person who feels this way. I am so tired of every single thing in my life going wrong. I am 36 years old and life has not gotten any easier. I know life isn't easy, I know life isn't fair, I know that just because you are good it doesn't necessarily come back to you but I also know that after 36 years of a life filled with pain I don't want to continue this journey. Some people say you make your own luck. To copy an oft used phrase, if I didn't have bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck at all. People who know me say that they cannot believe what bad luck I have. It's too much, I want it all to just stop."
3221,Chronic Thoughts,"Hi, I found these boards just surfing around and I'm new here ^^"
3224,Life way out of balance,"My life consists of mediocrity, pain, choas in my head, sexual confusion, mental emotional numbness, extreme emotional pain and heartache, no direction, passion in nothing, cynical views, lonliness, crippling introvert, scared to express myself due to poor self esteem so i say nothing and express nothing, no drive or motivation, no love, no joy, nothing to bring me through hard times, ive got nothing i can think that i want to live for, theres nothing i find enjoyment in anymore, Nothing i feel love for or feel love from, no one, no body, I'm ready to die, My life is all pain and no love, when there is truly nothing you want to live for then what are my options, I want to kill myself."
3225,I wanna die.,"I'm tired, things never get better and all I do is suffer. I had a fight with my mother on the phone this morning and she said stuff that point to me knowing that she's been talking about me with my half-sister (who isn't even her daughter) and my half-sister said she would come to my psychiatric evaluation to ""support"" me next week but she's been cold and distant and hasn't returned my calls (it's funny how she not long ago generalized that I never returned her calls- not even true - but she's been avoiding returning mine and it's my brother who leaves me messages saying he talked to her and stuff)."
3227,Depressed ex-girlfriend,"I broke up with my gf few months ago. She fell into depression, thought about suicide and cut her wrist slightly. I kept in contact till today but she is still dependent on me and gets moody or frustrated easily. I told her before that I will wait till she recovers but I wonder whether by being with her and still hugging her, am I worsening the situation. The problem is that if I keep physical contact to mimimun, it will make her feel sad too."
3228,I hate my life a lot.,"I hate my life a lot. Everything makes me dissapointed or angry in some way. I realize that I will get a bunch of responses saying ""there has to be something that makes you happy,"" or ""try doing things that make you happy,"" but the only thing that will make me happy is if I have a friend who will love me and give me a lot of affection and love. I know people will say ""try to get a girlfriend,"" and then when people realize that I would never kill myself no matter how bad my situation got they will stop replying, but i figured i would try and hope that there would be someone who understood and knew just what to say..."
3229,Just got dumped.. Cant hold it together..,18 yrs old
3230,Change in Plans,"When I was in high school, I planned on living only until my 21st birthday, where I could go somewhere alone and drink myself to death. I was severely depressed. It was a definite plan after having a few suicide attempts."
3231,I can't stop thinking about it...,I think about suicide... I'm always thinking about it.. ways to go about it...
3232,Feelings after fathers suicide attempt,My dad tried to kill himself Wednesday..ever since i've been being emotionally hurt by a friend..he doesn't agree with my feelings and has been making a lot of comments and remarks telling me how i should and shouldn't feel that are really making me feel lower in life
3233,Previous thoughts of suicide,"Is it normal for a person to have almost instantaneous thoughts of suicide when confronted by a highly emotionally challenging situation? In my case it was the resurfacing of feelings from a 4 year relationship break up some 4.5 months ago. It usually lasts a day or so then the thoughts of leaving my daughter behind make me feel guilty for even thinking it, then I switch to thinking perhaps she would be better off without a loser of a Dad. Eventually the feeling seems to subside to the point where I know the thought is still there but I'm not about to action it"
3234,Nothing to live for,"I'm 19, and family issues are leading me to suicide."
3235,I'm in a dark place right now.,My girlfriend left me for another guy. My parents are probably getting divorced because my dad had been cheating on my mom with prostitutes. I'm too skinny and cannot for the life of me meet anyone who is attracted to me.
3236,would god do everything to one person?,"i'm not big on religion.But,if there is a God would he do everthing to one person?as a rule,everyone has strong and weak points.God has chosen me as his running joke.he must have had a ball when he made me....this is the plan he came up with for me...I'm gonna make this dude have no dad,a mom that don't give a * * * * ,ugly.fat,dumb,bald before his time,the worst luck on earth.and if some how he finds a woman to overlook all this.surprise..oh yea..a small * * * * to boot..hahaha.. * * * * me!"
3237,I need to talk to someone,"I spoke to my ex over texts and instant messages. He said I haven't been what he wants for a long time and blamed me fir everything. He said to me, that he doesn't want or need my depression or my ""breaking his b**ls"" over him being with someone else (he wanted me to share him). I have missed him so much and I am sitting at home with a foot injury and he didn't seem to care that I'm hurt right now..."
3238,I'm scared things will never change,"Ok, so at the moment, I have no social life at all, and don't have any friends. I never really have to be honest."
3239,attempted...,"I found out my long distance ex already has a new gf. We've only been broken up for a few weeks. He told me before, when he wanted to go on a ""break"" that he wanted to be alone for a long, long time to sort himself out. What a lie.. Everything he said to me was such a lie, I don't think I can ever trust anybody again. I even warned this girl what he is like (very nice at first then turned abusive) and obviously she didn't listen. Probably met him in person and saw how gorgeous he is so she went with him anyways... Hes a charming abuser.. I tried to hurt myself the other day with an od, ended up in the hospital... I wish I could stop feeling so worthless... I cant enjoy life anymore or even have a sense of humour. I feel like I am a burden to my friends. Im in counselling but 1 hour a week isn't cutting it. Ive been a mess since all this happened with my ex and I hate myself so much. So easy for him to move on, I did all the work travellling.. Im sitting here feeling like such a fool for being so gullible with all his lies... I hate my life and I wish my attempt worked."
3240,I really can't carry on with life anymore!,Hello
3241,My BF is threatening with suicide..,Well.. three days ago I found out he has been into transsexuals for about 8 years now. Yesterday I confronted him. He told me if it comes out he will kill himself. I promised not to tell anybody else and I haven't. Though I am so alone and I don't know what to do.
3242,I am considering killing myself,"I'm not at the point where I honestly will, but I'm definitely thinking about it. Life is pointless...I will never get over my shyness, I will never get a girlfriend. Even looking at pictures of girls makes me feel depressed; I know seeing beautiful women should make me happy, but it just makes me feel miserable."
3243,"I just need someone to read/comment on my thoughts, that's all I want. take just a minute.","th me, for it's how I feel as it comes."
3244,I give up,"I seriously do just give up. Nothing is going right apart from my work and that's it, even then that work isn't amazing. People found out today about my ex girlfriend and I, who both go to the same school, and she doesn't know yet and I'll lose her when she finds out because she won't know what to do apart from ignore me. Girls in my year at school are just making all these comments and I just feel like giving up, I don't want to be at school anymore, I just want to hide at home or just die. Dying would be better. I wouldn't have to be constantly upset nor worried about life and everything would just go away. I'm not going to get anywhere in my life, and I hate the way I look and how I am, I hate that I can't stay in a relationship longer than 2 months or so, and I hate that people who are supposed to be my best friends are just making comments about my sexuality and as I found out today telling other people. I just give up. I'm a mess and I don't see the point."
3245,I want to just end it all... Now I don't... but tommorow I will...,"Just wanted to share something. I've always been depressed pretty much at the age of 10. Too young to even experience depression. And yeah, even though I'm not diagnosed of it, I think I'm bi- polar(how ever u spell it). In high school I've attempted several suicides but just couldn't pull the trigger..."
3247,Just want to tell people my story before i go x,"Tried everything, cant shake this feeling, medication has no effect anymore."
