					Giving Up
				","

							I am 17 years old and feel very alone. My relationship with my family is very messed up, I feel I have given up on trying to improve myself anymore for them because I keep screwing things up so much. (Like following rules, etc.) The only person I really really care about right now is my girlfriend, but we don't live so close to each other and therefore we've been having many problems communicating. She also takes advantage of the distance by leaving me for hours at a time whenever she is upset about something, leaving me very anxious and waiting for her to reply. It messes with me so much because I love her so much and my love is constantly thrown to the side whenever she gets upset since it's usually related to me. I don't know what to do because the ways I have to talk to her are getting taken from me from my family since I have started giving up on trying. "

					What to do in crisis situations?
				","

							I have quite a bad depression for which I have to take medication. As far as I can tell it's mostly due to my loneliness. When you're nearing 30 and still hoping for your first kiss it just really wears on you. As long as there is someone I can view as a potential partner, I can manage it decently thanks to my medication, but as I recently faced rejection all my usual depressive symptoms came back in full force. I usually get stuck in a situation where I'm unable to do anything but lay down and cry and it can last hours. It is at these points, that suicide feels like the only option. As unfortunate as it is, if I had access to something that'd dispatch me quickly and painlessly like a bullet to the brain, I would in all likelihood wouldn't even be here."

					I just want to end it all.
				","

							Hi everyone. I don’t know what to do I feel so lost and empty. Basically a backstory when I was 16 I had my virginity taken by a rapist which scarred me. A short while after this event I met a boy who I fell in love with, he made me very happy but he broke up with me suddenly and I’ve been depressed since. I engaged in promiscuous behavior I’m not proud of and I’ve had sex with 17 men. One of them told me that he tested positive for hepatitis c which means I might have it. I’m getting tested today and I’m terrified. I already feel that my life isn’t worth sh*t and if I test positive I’m really going to feel worthless. Every time i think things are getting better they don’t. I’m able to meet guys but they usually are just interested in sex. I recently met a guy who I fancied but I ended up sleeping over his house and putting out on the first date, and now he switched up and is acting indifferent towards me. I know I have nobody to blame but myself. I’m not a sex addict or something the truth is being raped made me so jaded towards it it doesn’t mean sh*t to me now so I end up putting out because it’s difficult for me to say no. "

					Does medication work on the long term?
				","

							Some say medication is used only to surpress feelings, to pack it down into your archive instead of healing it. My cousin needed a month to find the type of antidepressant that worked for her. After taking these for another whole month, all while also using meds to protect her stomach, she became addicted to them. She had to slowly break down her usage to zero and this took another whole month. After quitting her depression simply showed up again."

					Just Done

							This is so hard to write, I know my feelings are not forever but I just can’t get past how horrible everything feels. I don’t want to do anything to myself, but I also don’t care to be trapped in my crappy life anymore. If you’re inclined to read this, I’m happy to hear any suggestions other than hating every minute of every day. "

					Too suicidal to live, but too scared to commit suicide
				","

							My earliest memory of suicide was when I was 10. I tried to hang myself with a bath towel. I didn't grow up in a loving household, however it wasn't an abusive one either. We rarely had family dinners and no one seemed to ever care what was going on with each other. It was a very lonely childhood. I never misbehaved or got into trouble so I was left alone. Like a living ghost in my home. I remember having a teddybear who I fantasized would give me fatherly advice. Sad emotions were a taboo in my family, and very much still are 23 years later. "

					Boyfriend of ten years committed suicide and now I'm really struggling
				","

							Recently I experienced the most tragic loss, I have ever had to face, my beautiful partner of ten years committed suicide and since his death I am struggling to think of reasons to live myself, his departing has put holes in my heart that cannot be filled, I feel beyond empty, emotionally drained every day, every morning I wake up and everything seems so futile, even something as simple as having a shower, every normal action has lost meaning, I've been told a number of things, such as ""Time will heal all"" And ""You'll find someone else"" ""Things will get better"" things that I feel are said with the best intentions but offer little comfort, I am totally and utterly lost without him, we talked of having children, maybe getting married, we were both studying, it really was such a shock for everyone who knew him. I knew he was depressed but I never thought he would take his own life."

							Even tho i have been talked out of committing suicide more times than i can count but i still think about it -- i'll be fine and go to the store and walk by something a have the worst thoughts, like i walk into the cooking isle and see the knives and think what i could do w/ one.  Even tho I haven't OD in a while i still think bout it -- Worst of all i still think about my plan, where and when and how...."

					I just can't deal with these things anymore
				","

							Just as I started a new job, a new life after my ex moved out, things again took a different turn as I expected."
,"

							Hi. I’m going through something harsh right now. I want to tell you what happened so You can tell me what to do, or what you think about this situation. My parents separated and the day it happened, my mother threatened with suicide and then she used me: she told me that if I didn’t call my dad to come back, she would kill Herself. She started dressing up as if she was going outside to do it, and while she was doing it she kept telling me “I’m going to kill myself. Ever since I was 14 I don’t wanna live anymore. If you don’t call your dad I’m gonna kill myself” she kept repeating that over and over again. Her dad passed away when she was 14 so I suppose that’s the reason for her suicidal tendencies. Well so while she was telling me all that horrible stuff - and I must mention that she went under surgery last year, she almost died but didn’t thank god, and she had the nerve to tell me SHE MUST HAVE DIED THERE IN THE HOSPITAL - I started shaking and trembling and I started crying. My mother was capable of doing something like that to me. I couldn’t believe it. I called my father and told him I wanted him to pick me up and go to my grandpa’s house. When he came to pick me up, my mother took the keys off my hands, didn’t bother to put some pants on, and went outside and started screaming like crazy. Then she stood in front of my dads car, and started yelling “If you get away from here you’ll have to run me over with your car”. It was the middle of the night and I almost had an anxiety attack because of the nervousness."

							I hate life so much. I'm just a complete wreck of a human being. My future is completely hopeless. If I lose my current job, I will have nothing. My job is my whole life. There is nothing else in my life. I have no social life. Very few friends. I haven't had a girlfriend in six years. I haven't had sexual activity of any kind (with another person) in four years. I have absurdly terrible luck with the opposite sex. This past week I went to a strip club twice just to be around girls. It's pretty bad when you need strippers to provide you with female companionship. That's pretty near rock bottom, I'd say. "

							I don’t know what to do. My husband and I have a son who was stillborn three years ago. Since then we have had two living children. I have developed an anxiety disorder as well as an eating disorder and OCD. These things I feel make me a bad influence and role model for my girls. I am a horrible wife and can’t stand my husband most of the time. I threaten to divorce him then beg for him back on a monthly basis. "
"
					Why is this wrong?
				","

							I hate that the greatest lie I've ever told is ""I'm fine.""  It has never nor will it ever be the truth.  I am not being emotional anymore.  This is not some thought because of some emotionally shattering event.  This wish for death, to stop existing in the world doesn't go away when I genuinely smile or laugh.  It doesn't go away when everything that could go right, does just that.  This is thought out. I know The unfortunate people that I may hurt.  I know the consequences.  I know what I want  So why is it wrong?  Why is almost every suicide attempt treated the same?  Every time I go to therapy or to those hospitals after a 5150, all I hear is about how things get better.  How I might get through this.  The gist is they think those feelings will settle down enough for me to live a life and finally see the bright colors of life one day.  They think I just want to do this because of a momentary laps in judgment.  I want this.  I want to die and the only reason I'm not now is because they made the easiest and most effective ways to carry this out impossible for me.  They made it so I can be ""Saved"" ff I try again on pills, cutting, or some other slow method of death.  I do not want to be saved.  I do not want to go into this then wake up in some hospital.  I do not want to one day wake up from this and be put into a life with even more hurdles and disabilities, or even just be put in a coma. I do not want to became even more burdening to someone else.  I just want to die.  To do it in a way I cant come back, and a way I wont wake up to even more hardships to bare for myself and those around me.  Why does everyone say its wrong for me to want this?  That its wrong for me to try and carry this out on my own?  I just wish to fade out.  I've worked now for so long just to put myself in a position where me just dying and disappearing will have the least amount of emotional strain on those around me.  I know family and friends and all that say they'll be heart broken but time heals.  They will move on with their lives and carry out their dreams.  They'll have their wants and I'll have mine.  This 5150 has 4 more years to go.  After that I go.  I just really hope no one tries to stop me

					I know I'm suicidal
				","

							For whatever reason, I grew up being suicidal. I can recall being six years old and wishing I was dead. I fantasized about it regularly. All the way into my mid-20s. As result of whatever self-work I did in my mid-20s I hit a strange/surreal point: I stopped thinking about suicide but not on purpose. On some random day, i said in my mind, ""What a minute. I haven't thought about suicide in maybe months."""
"
					I'm done
				","

							Mid 40s. Been dealing with depression for the last 20 years. Laundry list of medications, none of which worked. Tried ECT, TCM, therapy, etc. I have considered killing myself several times over the years but because of my own fears and my family, I have never pursued it with intent. A big part of my depression is my lack of ability to have a serious relationship over the past 25 years. I don't know if this is the root cause of the depression or a side effect of it. I thought in my younger days that in order to attract women, I need to be the best person I can be. I've managed to be fairly successful. I'm a professor and I'm pretty well known in my field. I stay in pretty good shape, enough to complete in crossfit competitions. But frankly, my work and my other pursuits don't bring me any joy anymore. The fact that I'm not in a relationship and I don't have a family weighs heavily on me. I've come to the point where everything in life seems pretty pointless. I'm beginning to think it is time.

					Having a hard time tonight
				","

							I'm a 26 year old gay male. I'm a good guy who is not into the crazy lifestyle that most people thrive off of. I don't party, drink, hook up or anything of that nature. I don't hang out with a lot of people because I don't agree with there lifestyles.                                                                         I met this guy on Adam4adam in person. Fist time ever on that site, because it is primarily about hooking up. His name is Jeff, and I was totally up front with him about my lifestye. We have hung out 6 times, and it has been pretty good except I noticed he is a very sexual person and I am more into love and compassion.                                                               We both like to see each other weekly and want to get to know each other. We were talking last night and he was talking about how we were a good match and I replied ""I love my Jamaican man"" referring to him. Then he texted ""What are you trying to get this excited work"". Then I asked him why he was feeling down, because he mentioned he was earlier in the conversation. I never heard from him, and messaged him later and told him how I love his culture, and that I said that because I am proud to be with someone of that race. I've been trying to call him and asked him what is having an issues about. He won't respond to me at all.                                              I'm really sad because I feel like I'm going to lose him over something so silly. I told myself I'd never been with anyone again because it can be really stressful sometimes and it's sooo hard to find someone I feel compatible with. Or who accepts me for my reserved lifestyle.

					Feeling low/suicidal

							Hi my ex broke gf just broke up with me 2 months ago. We’ve spoken everyday. It was long distance her Uk me Australia, we discussed last week that we would consider getting back together once my citizenship is approved. She went away for the weekend to Italy on a romantic vacation with her new gf she never told me she was seeing anyone til just over a week ago. I reacted badly over the weekend to it was quiet nasty to her and now she says that any chance of us getting back together is out the window. I too have contemplated killing myself I’ve sat here all day working out which way to do it but I’m trying to be strong. I just can’t work out how to let her go or move on! The pain is deep. My hearts shattered. I need help but I know talking to someone doesn’t stop the pain and suicide isn’t the answer it’s working out how to let go and live without her I’m so lost.

					I Just Do not Want to Feel Anymore
				","

							Lately my life has been extra amounts of disappointment, sadness, regret, and depressing.  I've been seeking help from a therapist and she has helped me see alot of things about my depression i never really thought about.  But now knowing it makes it feel all worse.  I've always felt like i was never worth the time to anyone.  I guess this stems from my birth father abandoning me before I was born.  He called my mom a  for trying to get in between his own wife who was also pregnant,  called her a  and shamed her because she had to test 2 separate guys,  and was shammed and embarrassed because my grand parents had to be the ones to catch her and help her both financially and take control of how they would proceed regarding my father.  They all just let him go.  Let him leave.  And I see that now I try to prove my worth to not just my mom for having put her through all of that, but I also seek to have other people see me as useful and worth their time.  That somehow that gives me worth.  Problem is when I'm alone.  How I think about me when there is not anyone around to please.  I hate myself.  I think I should have never been born.  I feel bad that I leach onto people and just suck gratitude for my own self image.  Next I guess is my family.  My grand parents entered the picture really early on but from the moment I could understand things, Ive seen they never liked me.  That I was a stain on more or less perfect image of their family.  That my mom choosing to not give me up to adoption was going to ruin the christian image of my family.  But they kind of sucked it up.  Not without still taking it out on me.  They constantly expected me to be better.  To fill a role for them and for the family.  This has always felt to me like they just wanted me to prove to them and those who looked down on my family, that I was not a mistake. Even when I hit the point where I wanted to meet my father they told me to wait and go to him after I've proven myself and make him regret leaving.  I had to show my worth to everyone.  Worse was my cousins I feel got jealous.  My grand parents to them where kind loving and like grandparents always are said to normally be.  But to the cousins I got extra attention, and they were the ones that raised me.  So they started playing a game.  Whenever any of the cousins got together they ignored me or picked on me for any little mistake or problem.  One on One they were all kind and I loved spending time with them.  But as a group they made me feel so small.  Like if I had proven my worth to them before, it didn't matter now.  I was the freak.  The black sheep.  The bastard child.  They all looked down on my mom.  Seeing this started the feelings that no mater what I do I'm not going to ever succeed on proving myself worthy of life.  Worth the time and effort to keep my going.  I guess the last thing is really the relationships I have had.  Not just romantic.  Friends to me have done the same thing.  That event when kids can be kind in one moment then get in a group and change to fit what is normal.  I've never fit into that.  I've liked so many things in my life even up until recently and no matter what it is, Its not normal, its weird, and I am weird for liking it.  I know I put my worth in the hands of others, and I know that why those comments always hit me so hard.  Worse is those romantic relationships.  Its happened a lot before in friendships before I started dating, but I know I get easily used.  I'm vulnerable and I just let people come in and take what they want, but it hearts way worse from someone I trusted with my heart.  Someone I was happy being around and I thought I brought joy to as much as they brought it to me.  They all were bad.  But the one example of how bad they got was with the girl I had a crush on in high school.  We didn't date in high school, talked a bunch and were friends but she never saw me much more then a decent guy.  No I left school for 3 years then met back up with her.  I at that time really liked one of her friends that I worked with.  I was seeing this girl for a bit, but my ex was helping me.  Talking to her friend and giving me advice.  She also liked one of my roommates.  We tried with these other people and that didn't work out.  Then she went after my other roommate.  I gave her advice and I started to feel for her, but I didn't want to be with a girl who was seemingly working through the house, and who I knew just became  buddies with the newer roommate.  Once he was done with her he dropped her.  She had her own depression and experiences that she had and I became the one to try and help.  I guess she started feeling for me but I was still conflicted with just that recent past.  Finally I gave in and started dating her.  I was happy.  I loved her and she said she loved me.  For 7 months we dated until her issues with her family came hostile.  I said I would let her move in with my temporarily until her friend got ready to move in with my ex.  But a month past, then a few more, until she was there for another 6 months.  She made rules for me and made me cut out friends she thought weren't good for me.  Guilt ed me into doing things I had not wanted to do.  My best friends that she had tried to date left because she made it unbearable for them to stay, and she convinced me that they were abandoning me.  She became a pillar of support in my mind.  But one day it seemed like she stopped caring.  Her rules where still in place for me but, they didn't apply to her.  I couldn't hang out with friends of the opposite sex but she was fine doing so.  And if I said anything about it shed get angry and its my fault because i brought it up.  I was controlling her apparently.  We were dating for a year and a half at this point and for another 6 months she just sat in the room playing games every day until she needed to go to work.  And some days she didn't come home.  Out with the guy she knew I was uncomfortable with.  I felt broken a bit then.  Like I was unappreciated for trying to help her and now felt mostly alone because she was never there.  At the job I helped her get working with me I was visibly depressed and it was all inwards.  IO thought What did I do wrong.  I must not be doing enough.  I m a terrible person if she feels like this.  Turns out she started telling our boss and co workers.  and one day I looked at the schedule and I wasn't on there anymore.  My name was there but no hours.  I asked my boss and she told me that everyone in the store asked to no longer work with me.  Said shell give me hours the next week but I knew she had to say that.  I was pushed out.  So i put in a two weeks and ended it.  Decided Id start college and make that my priority.  To get me and my ex out of this area and make a happy life together.  But then she told me.  She didn't love me anymore.  Didn't think she ever loved me.  so she said we should go on a break.  Distance makes the heart grow fonder i guess.  one day in she both called me up in the middle of the night and told me she made a mistake. then the next morning she made her decisions.  She went over the guy I was uncomfortable with whom I also used to work with at the previous job.  Then made her decision then.  She was done.  But she didn't want to make my financially unstable or herself and still wanted to be friends.  So she said shell stay living with me.  I made one request so I could heal.  Don't date anyone especially that guy, if your gonna live with me.  That would push me over the edge.  this all happened about a week before our anniversary.  Then she came home one day.  Every night going to that guys house always super late at night.  Then I see her in her room deleting all pictures she had of me. During this week she wasn't even nice to me.  Getting upset and literally saying not my problem to me when needing to talk about my depression.  Then I saw her phone.  She just went to check her messages and there it was.  When we where together but she fell out of love with me she started hiding her phone.  Even caught her texting in the middle of the night and when asking what she was doing, she would shut her screen off and get upset with me for asking.  It made sense.  All the time with that guy she spent in our relationship,  she was cheating.  Even her brother told me she was afterwords.  and now she was in a relationship with me.  this was a day after our anniversary would have been.  I broke down.  I tried to end my life then too.  I felt used like I had before in other relationships and was only good for what I provided.  She was even planning on using me even after breaking up with me.  I got through that.  I knew I wouldn't be able to love much after that.  I held my heart tightly and tried to guard it.  But I got a new job and was out there still flirt and even seeing other people.  Had a few more bad ones but then the most recent.  2 weeks ago from this post in fact.  I started dating this girl while she was still in a relationship. In truth I felt terrible about it.  I was her supervisor at work and we knew we were a bit iffy in terms of the moral and corporate problems.  But we had fun. We were ourselves and happy.  She had been in a relationship and lived with this guy that took her for granted and expected things out of her instead of seeing her as a treasure.  She was kind but stubborn,  had ambition, desires, and knew how she was going to get them., but I thought she was respectful.  After a while we both felt that it was best to get her out and time where her ex might find out was running out.  So I offered to help her for a while.  We agreed to make it temporary.  She knew about the last girl I talked about and knew the damage emotionally she did.  This new girl new about my depression, and she was wanting to prove herself to me seemingly.  That she wanted to be in my life.  She sat me down and told me that if it even came to needing to take a break form the relationship she would hurt but she would understand and do so with every intent that we would be together again.  So we moved out of that guys place in one day while he was at work but she didn't ever talk to him after that.  She left the silence as a break up.  We set the rules and what we are comfortable with and we were doing well.  But something started changing.  This girl had her own past and one of those things were being sexual assaulted by her ex faience.  After she borke it off with him for cheating on her he came back.  Started talking to her while she was with someone else.  And she told me she felt those feelings for her ex then.  She met with him when he came back in town a place where she felt shed be safe with others, but the others all left.  Her ex used words and her dreams to talk her into giving in little by little.  Until he was done.  I know in order for her to heal she had to say it wasn't her fault.  That she wasn't guilty of going there to him.  But it started feeling obvious that she still applies that idea she didn't do anything wrong to everything to this day.  One month into living with her and she was accusing me of taking away all her time to make the free bedroom into her office.  I know I made a mistake in not seeing time working on the room or just casually hanging out as quality time with her, but I wanted her to feel like that room was hers, and that I wasn't in her way.  That she could make that room however she wanted.  One day she stopped working on it and other days she also started hanging out with someone I found uncomfortable.  This person was another one of her exes that she started recently reconnecting with.  I told her it was uncomfortable but all I asked was not to hang out alone with him.  if she was with people I knew would help watch over her and make sure that sexual assault wouldn't happen again.  But to her that was controlling.  All I wanted was her to be safe and yeah I didn't want to be cheated on again.  but it was not my intention to pry into what was going on in those group situations.  As long as I knew she was safe and happy.  2 Weeks ago though I went to work.  I was stressed out by the night before and the issue i thought was happening.  That she wasn't willing to change or adapt for me even though I had been so much to accommodate both her living with me and her boundaries and wants.  On that day I was told by my mother that this girl was moving out.  She had that ex and another guy pulling out all her stuff. I tried to call her while i was at work and finally got to talk to her only be calling my mom and my mom handing the phone to her.  She just kept saying to stay at work.  I felt myself breaking then. I left work and ran home locked those guys out and just begged for her to talk to me.  That she can still move out fine.  I knew this was temporary living but why could she not just talk to me before hand or tell me what was going on.  After it all I was told she asked my mom how I would feel about her moving into that exes house and what I might do.  She knew I was inwardly hostile but I wouldn't hurt anyone else.  within the 2 weeks we did talk a bit.  One thing was that at that time she was scared of me.  That I would hurt her, her stuff, or her cats.  After that day I tried to take my life again.  I was stopped by my mother and the police that that ex called on me saying I was violent and going to hurt her.  The next day I was let go and she came over again, the told me that she would be coming over and i made the one rule that if her ex comes with her i wont let anyone in the house.  That I  was shown so little care already and I dont want him around my home.  At first he wasn't there, just her moms and the friend that set us up more or less.  But he came.  After I had let her come in to help me get her cats in carrier and we talked about the issues.  That we both agreed it was soon to move into together and we never learned the quirks of talking and understanding one another.  Words we used with each other meant and came off differently then the intent of the user.  And that was fine.  It was nice.  We agreed that wed because of the situation take a break of sorts.  Still be that we are in a relationship, just taking time for at least a week in order to think, recharge and maybe get back together.  Maybe was a big thing though.  She had been hurt in her past be more then just the sexual assault. A past full of guys that would say and do anything to get her back in bed or like her father just use her and see her more like a tool then a person.  She knew that one other problem was that she saw me as a mixture of all the men in her past.  they goggles she was wearing where so covered in the  that those guys threw her way that when she looked at me she saw the shape but couldn't see who i was really.  She had throughout our relationship compared me and told me she saw things that reminded her of them but I always tried to talk to her and show her, even change so I wouldn't be like them.  and thought the 2 weeks I was trying a lot to prove to her that I wasn't them.  that she was important to me that I can and will change for the better to make sure she feel comfortable.  In this 2 weeks we hung out multiple times and even cuddled and laughed. Things where like when we first started dating.  And I made it clear that It still wasn't okay the way she left.  I had my feelings about this whole thing to, but she was more important then anger or sadness.  When we where talking and together in person things felt nice.  really happy and like we were making good progress on talking to and understanding one another.  But, I dont know maybe she really felt it wasn't intentional to do any of this but,  the friend who set us up told me my now ex made up her mind at the beginning of all of this.  Well a few events happened in the past 2 weeks.  One was My birthday, the day before thanksgiving.  This day is an example of why i pointed out we were good in person together.  In text she told me she was tired and that my birthday didn't matter enough to her for her to spend that day with me.  She she told herself shed have dinner with me then go hang out with her friends alone then go home.  She even told me that in truth she didn't even want to go at all, she was thinking of just canceling.  Made a point to say I better feel special.  but then that night we talked a lot and tried to clear the confusion a bit more.  Throughout this time I always prefaced that I dont want her to give me her answer, just her thoughts at the moment.  A way for me to deal with the silence and uncertainty from her day by day.  I told her that the feelings of unknown hurt more then just ripping the band aid off.  that closure was more important for my state of mind then anything and that i just needed hope that she wouldn't do the same thing as she did her ex.  Just stop talking to, block from everything, and that is breaking up.  When I found out that she made up her mind with no other information I started to break again.  Our friend also told me that this ex also made a rule that she could not talk to me while he was around or at the house that she moved into with him and the other guy from the first day.  The thoughts swarmed in my head.  Was she just using me and being kind to me because she just wanted to get the rest of her stuff.  And why wait?  Why string me along for 2 weeks.  in this time I started to see things I didn't pay attention to before.  Things like she was willing in order to get more money to push out the friend who set us up together, and justified it by saying that this friend was young and could fail or fall, run back to home, and start over.  it wouldn't be the end of the world for her.  I also saw she would never say sorry even if she walked over your feet.  She felt no guilty for moving out the way she did and she felt no guilt or blame for everything shes ever done.  She was willing to do anything to get what she wanted even if it meant stepping on others to reach it.  And I was that step.  Maybe she didn't intend all this and maybe it wasn't all true.  But I needed to know.  I called her and left her a few messages about what I knew a bit about what I thought and I prefaced this is only my thoughts not the truth I have fully accepted as such.  But if its true then to break up with me.  To just pull the band aid off so I can see the wound and move on and let it heal.  So now words from her.  She blocked my numbers, blocked me on everything, and I haven't heard from her at all in the past few days.  But truth is I always felt that I had an emptiness in me and after that first girl I mentioned I felt broke.  I rebuilt a bit but this newer girl I told myself that she was important enough to put in my all, and make her feel loved, and cherished, and respected, like the other men in her life never did.  She told me about her dreams of having her own place again with her cats where she can say its all hers.  Her space.  And she wanted to be more independent.  Not feel like she was leaching or being held up by others.  And those thoughts were things we talked about.  That I want her to feel she has her own space and home, so I've been supporting her however she wants on finding that place.  And I've made sure to back away from her so she feels like she can do things on her own but that if she stumbles or starts to fall that its not her relying on the help,  and shes not not independent for having someone who want to be there to make sure she never has to feel the fall to the ground.  Just to have back up.  Truth is though I never got that closure.  I dont know if she hates me, never loved me, left just because she wants her independence, or if i was left for the other guy.  There is so many other things and I'm still living in the dark not knowing anything.  the band aid is mostly ripped but the evidence of what caused the wound cant be known without seeing all the wound.  And it hurts, every day it hurts.  This time is worse then all the others.  I put in all that I had left into this one and the emptiness inside me feels bigger.  Not just bigger hole, more like there isn't anything left.  It all feels gone.  I dont have the drive to pick up again and start over.  I dont feel like I have those dreams for my future any longer.  I close my eyes and see no hope.  no anything but the darkness in me now.  And I still love her.  If she did those bad things intentionally or unintentionally, I love her, but its not all about her.  The darker thoughts just tell me over and over again ""See your not worth it.""  The one you thought was different you turned into the same as all the rest.  You failed to prove your worth the life your mother gave you, and the time she gave you.  Everyone hates you obviously they are only kind to you by themselves because they have some sense of fear or guilt they might feel telling me I'm not worth it.  They dont want to individually be responsible for my state of mind so they just wait and act until they get back with the group.  The one person I know cares about me unconditionally is my mom, and i know I dont deserve that love.  I can prove to her that I was worth all she went through.  About 4 months ago my aunt shot herself in the head.  No note, no warnings.  She was just seen before that with my great grandmother and grandmother and she was smiling and going through her day.  I see her as brave.  To me she finally stopped living for other people and did what she wanted.  I know its selfish to not think of how it affects others, but I've lived my life trying to make others happy and like me and see my worth as a person.  I want to finally live for me, to do what I want and make myself finally feel free from it all.  The expectations, the thoughts I'm not worth it, from those who just use me, and those who cant or wont see I try.  I'm tired of always feeling I have no accomplishments.  Everywhere I try to make others happy is always undercut but the end results.  I try at a job for 2 years and make everyone see I'm good at what I do.  I help and come in when needed, I do what is asked, even do other peoples jobs that they themselves never want to do.  Then I bring in a person that I care about even in other examples just a new person comes in in general, and because they have a problem with me they start talking.  They turn all the people I thought saw my worth and cared, against me.  They turned so fast and so completely, that all that time and effort is gone.  I've lost all of it and didn't even get the closure to think maybe I can rebuild and move on.  I think back in my life and I see happy memories but they are all sad, because in the end of those they all end badly.  Either someone, something, or even myself ruined it all. And people keep trying to tell me its just one situation, or one thing.  that time will heal it.  I just dont see it.  Its so much more.  I'm tired of feeling like this every day.  I just wish and want it all to go away.  To feel free and do what I want for me for once in my life.

					Death's Embrace
				","

							I wish for death to come and finally take me into its embrace.  That I be free of the pain in my heart and mind.  I wish I could choose to ignore and be free of these feelings.  To live and move on but I feel I can't.  I feel that the consequences and retribution of the things I've made others feel and do, will haunt me forever.  No matter what I do I can never atone for it all.  To never be a person others don't learn to regret giving their time to. I don't feel I'm worth it to anyone in the end.  I wish to fade.  To stop existing.  To never been seen again.  I wish I could choose never to have been born.  To have been given the real choice that matters.  The choice to live but that was never mine to choose.  If it was, I would never have been.  That is my biggest regret.  To be alive was something I never have wanted.  To be alive is regretful.  To be seen and exist.  All I do is make others learn to hate me.  It's so wrong for me to do this.  To make others feel regret they ever gave me time.  I wish I could lay somewhere no one could ever see and to wither away.  But as a human I crave interaction.  I know I'm not wrong for that.  It's humanity that craves that feeling.  I regret being brought into this humanity.  If it matters anymore I choose to be free.  I choose to no longer exist.  I may not be able to atone for how I made others feel in life but I can give closure to all them and myself be exiting from life.  Exiting from a life I never should have been given.  Leaving a mother whose future was claimed by my own.  Leaving a family that could have saved their time and money on anything that could bring them actual joy and happiness instead of feelings of what could have been.  Leaving the people that came and went and that I only was another person in passing.  And to leave the ones that I actually affected in such a terrible way.  People don't need to feel the pain and regret that I bring.  While I can't take back what I've done or made others feel.  I can give them all peace that they no longer have to worry about my existence.  They no longer have to think about me in any way.  I will be air and dirty to all.  Faded and unable to affect anyone ever again.  For those who care I will achieve peace and for those that don't then you will feel the peace.  I wish to hurt no one.  I've made a choice.  I will not regret it.  I will not turn away from it.  Death is my answer.  It will take me into its embrace.  I will be free.  I will feel the one thing I chose.  Peace.

As soon as I set foot on that college campus, I knew this path was not right for me but my family encouraged me to stick with it. I ended up doing so poorly in my classes that many times my professors advised me to choose another career. It took me 8 years (yes EIGHT) to finally get my Master's. Of course, I cannot get a job in my field no matter how hard I try. For the last 12 years I've been working in retail and I absolutely HATE it! Even though I constantly apply, I haven't moved passed being a Sales Associate, I'm tired of dealing with rude customers who look down on me, and the pay is miserable.

Up until now I've been putting on a happy face but I don't want to be happy anymore. I want to be sad. I want to be alone. And I don't want to do anything. It was my life stressors that pushed me to this point. I am in charge of homecoming, moving for the 8th time in 3 years this week, etc. I expected so much of myself and now I feel useless and worthless cuz I can't meet those expectations. But I've had so many verbal and emotional attacks from others while planning homecoming. I already felt inadequate but now I feel completely and entirely like a waste of energy. Like why do this anymore. Why should I use so much energy to be happy when I can just bask in the solitary silence and be alone and just be sad? Being sad is so much easier. I don't even want to be alive rn but at the same time I can't imagine the pain others will deal with if I do leave...

My brother was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and is 25 nearly 26 now and still lives with us. He just sits around and complains about how the world is  and no one loves him and how he is being watched by the NSA and all that. My mom has been depressed ever since my dad left her for someone else so she doesn't really care about anything anymore. I have no friends and so basically I don't really have anyone to talk to. My self esteem is practically non existent, however I've tried things like exercising and meeting new people to help with that but it doesn't really work. I'm most self conscious about how I look, I'm 5'2 which is extremely short and the girl I dated for a year recently told me she had been cheating on me with other guys because I wasn't good looking enough to satisfy her lust and that she dated me for the emotional support that she needed. I can't be too mad about this though because I should have expected it. It was a blessing that someone like that was ever with me. I can't talk to anyone because they all have too much to deal with right now and to them I'm the only 'normal' and 'happy' one. To sum up, I just want to die. Please help.

It became life threatening 3 years ago, the same time I fell in love. He got me through it all. I've always been very strong, but I needed the strength he gave me and I survived and thrived because of him. I've battled for 3 years to stay stable. I've lost so much. I had to drop out of university, my parents divorced abruptly, I had to move home. I was constantly in and out of hospital. My mum started dating a guy my age and stop bothering to see me even when I was sick. 5 friends have died from my condition. I have been terrified of death every day. But because of my love, I could smile and be upbeat. I felt blessed. I wouldn't have given him up even for health. I'd experienced a healthy life for 20 years and it was great. But he made me feel transcendently wonderful. Even when I couldn't walk far and lost more independence. He was my light. He moved to be here with me & we were so in love. So happy. "

							Hello.. not sure how to start but, I'm 19 years old and I see all my friends having the time of their lives while I'm never accomplishing anything since high school ended two years ago. Ever since I've been pretty depressed because I'm still trying to get into college but still no success (you need to pass a test to enter in my country) and honestly Ive got no hopes I'll ever be able to pass, while my sister when she was my age she was already studying at the best college in our country. So the stress and pressure are suffocating me and the tests are coming and im feeling desperate. I dont know how will I look at my family when I tell them I failed."

							This was my last resort on to venting. The last thing I heard from ""family"" was ""nobody wants to hear about your problems"" Everyday I feel so worthless, I don't wanna be here, I always think about taking my own life. I feel so unwanted.. always have with this family. The time I needed someone to talk to, they stabbed me in the back & I got is ""nobody wanna hear about my problems"" I felt like I never had a mom or dad figure in my life. They was never there. Never came to any of my sports game. Never heard ""I love you"" from them .. only time was when I almost took my own life. Idk what to do anymore, I push myself everyday but I don't wanna live anymore. People just think I doing this for attention. But it really isn't , I'm really feeling like this , always since I was a little girl. I keep telling my mom that everyone who is adopted is different. My heart is just filled with pure anger & hurt. & other people are sooo happy & already met there family & some people just don't care there adopted. But the way I found out & how I found out, traumatized me & hurts me till this day.

							I've been depressed for 16 years now. That's more that half my life and things don't feel any better. Through the years I've had reasons not to kill myself (friends, family, fear of going to hell) but I've never found a reason to actually live. I've been on different pills and seen therapists and psychologists and they only help enough to keep me from crying as often but I've never for a second stopped wanting to die. Now here I am working a job I don't want to fund a life that I don't want. I'm done. I've given myself 30 days to find a reason to live and then I'm going to kill myself. I'm tired of sticking around for other people and I'm starting to resent them all for keeping me here anyway. If they hate me, that's fine. Maybe it will help them get over my death quicker. But I can't go through day after day of constantly feeling like I'm burning alive just because they want me to.

					Still In So Much Pain
				","

							I started a thread over a month ago explaining how I met this 54 year old man on a game that I play on my phone. I have been hurt very badly in the past and pretty much closed myself off from the world. I started playing a game on my phone in January I never talked with the other players until about a month and a half ago. I met this man we started talking thru the game then email then Skype. I never had Skype before this. He said like myself he had been hurt in the past. He promised me a friendship which I so desperately needed. I started sending him sweet Good Morning messages and then he asked me to write sexual fantasy stories for him which I did I was a writer and I figured what's the harm. Then we eventually started sexting and just use your imagination about what we did on Skype. These are things that I have never done before. I somehow allowed myself to trust him and open up to him about very personal and private things. I real believed he was true and genuine especially because of his age and him also being hurt. Things started not going to well when I realized he was starting to blow me off. He would make excuses that he was busy but still wanted me to write sex fantasies for him. Then I find out from several other players on the game that he was doing the same thing with them. It was more of a be careful of this man on the game warning. He also wrote posts on this sight several years ago basically giving a sob story about his break up with an ex girlfriend but meanwhile trying to pick up vulnerable women on this sight. He went by the name of ""Blueboy"". This man hurt me really bad. He got enjoyment out of hurting me and he made sure I knew it. I am in so much pain over him and a little over 2 weeks ago I tried to take my own life. I am still in the hospital now and will probably be here for another month while healing from my injuries. Doctors told me it's a miracle that I'm even still alive. I have been getting intense therapy also. One of my ways to heal was that I had to write an email to this man explaining how much he hurt me and humiliated me. I also asked him a lot of questions as to why he would do this. I have been hurt in so many ways in my life but would never ever hurt another person because of it. My psychologist told me not to expect any answers from him because he got everything he wanted from me. I want her to be wrong. I need these answers. I can't get this man out of my head. He's all I think about. I even have bad dreams about him. I know I have to put some of the blame on myself. I should have been more cautious and I moved way to fast with him. Anyway I sent him an email and practically begged him for some answers. He replied back a few days later saying that he needed time to reply to my email. That's all he said. I still haven't heard anything from him. How much time should I give him? I also noticed that he is still on the game everyday probably doing the same thing with even more women. He needs time to reply to my email but he is still on that game all the time. Just to let you all know my email was a very serious one. I didn't say one mean thing. I don't have it in me. I don't know what else to do. I really need answers from him. I really did care deeply for this man in some ways I still do. There is so many other details to this. The things he said to me. I believed every word of what he told me until my psychologist pointed out indiscretions in his mails and text messages as she read them all. How could I be so stupid. I try to see the good in people and all I do is get hurt by it.

I usually think jcould never do it to them but each day im more and more tempted because of the deep pressure i have felt since a child. Im 19 and in my generation if your not beautiful then you are worthless regardless of how smart, talented, or nice you are. People always say ""looks dont matter"" etc but people treat me based on my looks my full life. I often worry about not attracting an intelligent man to have children with because he wont be attracted to me. So then i will never have children because i wont get pregnant to someone who is a fool and will raise my children that way. So then i though of getting plastic surgery but then i would be 100% fake and would still be ugly deep down. Please help me. I try so hard daily not to focus on this but it has genuinley been tearing me apart for my whole life and i feel like i can no longer cope with the constant pressure to be beautiful

However, in the 15 years of service which I have completed, I have seen stress and the inherent responsibility of this job force to retire.

When this happened I fell into a deep depression. I have always struggled with depression but this was different. I had made an attempt to take my life but was unsuccessful. Afterwards I sought help from my closest friend. He did everything to help me, as my family did. Nothing changed. I went to therapy, took meds, exercised, and socialized all to no avail. My friend pleaded with me to give it time. ""One year"" he said, ""Please just wait one year. If nothing has changed and you still long for death then I can't stop you."" I loved him too much to deny him this request. It has been a year now, and still I have felt nothing but misery and despair. I never feared death, and have long since come to terms with my end. Now, I want to show my family and friends that I love them and I want them to understand. I don't know what to do, how could anyone ask another to be okay with their passing? I want my memory to be one of love in the end. I don't want to leave them with only pain

							So for as long as I remember I've struggled bad with self esteem, every since I was younger . I use to be chubby during my middle school years and I was insecure about my nose and boys didn't really go for me, when I turned about 15 I lost a lot of weight I went down to 109 lbs and I started to wear different clothes fix my hair different and wear contacts . Guys started to really notice me .. Fast forward to age 17. (Now) I had only had sex with one person I lost my virginity at 15 to a guy I had been with on and off since I was 13 I really loved him but obviously he didn't feel the same because he left me for another girl and that triggered something . My father has never been in my life so I find myself really seeking male attention and idk if that's why... But it started with this guy from work he showed interest in me and kept staring at me , we ended up flirting and one thing led to the next and we end up having sex a few times but of course he used me . Quit his job and never heard from him again , he was 21. So I was bummed I really started to like him but then I downloaded apps to meet people . I ended up talking to this guy and we ended up hanging out he started feeling on me and we smoked and I let him have his way.. But then the next time we hung out he let his friends have their way with me when I kept saying no but they still did what they did anyway it was about 3 of them and a 4th wanted to join I was so afraid and screwed up after this but I still wanted to talk to him for some  reason because I just don't know .. I'm ed up. Then I went online again (yeah I know I'm dumb) started talking to more guys I wanted to feel wanted and pretty and never thought I could go out and meet someone since I don't have much friends anymore ... Met a guy my age (17) we hooked up I didn't say no but afterwards I felt like a complete  and guess what I never heard from him again but I missed my period and I have a feeling I'm pregnant by this guy . Ik I wouldn't be pregnant by any other guy considering I got my period after I had sex with them. & they used condoms. This guy did not and he ejaculated inside of me ... Anyway I started to talk to this really cool guy he told me all guys weren't the same we had an intellectual conversation about life and love and everything and he wasn't my type AT ALL.. But I really fell for his personality we talked for a few weeks then we hung out . We smoked but we DID not have sex but we did kiss.. The second and third time however I gave in and we had sex. And of course Ik it's my fault it's just I really feel like I'm not pretty and so I let guys have their way because I think maybe they will start to like me .. But this guy turned out to be exactly the same . He told me he wasn't looking for anything serious and he basically just wanted to have sex . It broke my heart because I really thought this guy was different ..nah. I'm down I don't know how to feel I wanna commit suicide and if God is real I wanna feel loved for the first time . I'm just so tired of not being good enough . I was never good enough my family doesn't even like me . I'm an only child btw the only family I have is my mom and my grandma ..

					Why are people always so negative about the idea of committing suicide?
				","

							Personally , I think that committing suicide can be in a lot of cases be the most rational and therefore the right thing to do , I mean think about it ? you're gonna die anyway , if you have some definitive evidence that your life is going to either be an awful one or,in the best case scenario,be just a one that's not really that good or interesting  , then what's the point of living this sort of life , why not just end it right now and save yourself the effort . And even if you think that this ain't true and that somehow there's hope , then still , this hope that things could get better is just a possibility countered by an almost equal other possibility that things are never really going to be that good. I personally am fond of the idea of killing myself . The only thing stopping me is this stupid and irrational survival instinct we all have as living organisms. If I'm able to defeat it , then I wouldn't even give it a second thought and just do it , just end it right there.People always say that ""it's not worth it"" . I agree with that statement except I think that nothing is really worth living for because it's all really destined to end eventually . If you were able to do or create something that the whole entire earth population would glorify you for , you're still gonna die , the entire human race which you served there is gonna be wiped out too, and all what will be left is nothing , just pure nothing,so what's the point then? I'm not gonna do it , just to be clear , however, if I could I would. .Anyway what do you guys think about this .

							I am married with 2 girls age 17 and 9. My Husband is serial cheat, a lier, he is deceitful in every way, shape and form. Last night we had another argument. My 9 year old was upset and now its my fault. He happy of course becuase he has his cakes and eats it. I have decided this relationship is no good and as I am the one in misery and making everyone else miserable, then I should go. I could move and live somewhere else, but to do what, get a cleaning job and live in a grotty flat, no thanks. I don't know why I didn't think of this before, it was like a flashing light bulb moment but suicide is the best option for me. I would like it to be painless, yes I am a coward. I would just like to take 1 tablet and let it be then end. He will bring the bimbo in my bed quickly after, if he hasn't already I am in no doubt about that. I am staying until after Christmas (not that heartless), but I think before my birthday near the end of Jan. I don't want a funeral, people going here lies a woman who was that crap her family no longer liked her. I think we have insurance so if one of us dies then its paid off, not sure if they paid out on suicidse. Not sure if we got insurance as he controls all the moneyl so I can see who he spends all his money on.  I like to be cremated do what ever they want with the ashes. I don't know why people choose their own songs at funerals, its not like you are going to be around to listen to it. I use to think people who commited suicide was selfish, especially the ones who kill their families too. But no, not anymore. I understand. We who decide we are not good enough for this life are not selfish at all. Our, especially mine, departing can only benefit. Husband gets the wife he clearly deserves. Kids get a mum who is not studying at the OU at 43 because she was not good enough at 18. A mum who can cook without the whole house knowing about it. The house who is always clean, dog always walked, get to go to all children's school events instead of going to work to pay the mortgage because he spends all his cash on her. He will have someone he is not embrassed about. Someone he can take to parties, instead of saying"" you can't come you have to study"". He will find someone that when she burns tea, breaks a cup, he won't be thinking ""If I was with so and so this will not be happening"".  His new wife will be that great he won't need to have an affair in front of his daughter. His new wife won't be walking on eggs shells thinking I do something wrong he will be thinking I wish I was with her, she won't cringe when the kids argue with each other because she knows he won't he won't be thinking I wish I was with her as my life, family and marriage would be perfect. She won't have to stand next to him in the supermarket while he flirting with other bimbos, telling them that they are better than her. Yes life would be perfect when I am gone.

					Best way to kill myself?
				","

							I am 23 years old  and sometimes i just want to end it. I want to know what's the best way to do it, because i can only choose one, i was thinking about jumping from the top of a building or hang myself, but that last option is probably slow and painful. I think killing myself is the best and definitive solution, and remember that we are just small numbers and stats in this crzy world, and i am almost convinced that nobody will care if i kill myself and people will just carry on with their lives, no need to worry about others being sad about me. Knowing that i am scared because i don't believe too much in religion and i don't know what's on the other side but sometimes a solution is a solution, forever. Don't worry about me guys, i am just another number, an irrelevant number.

					Courteous Suicide
				","

							Hi -  I'm looking for answers on 'Courteous suicide'.  Before you jump in and say there is no such thing; suicide is a very complicated topic and it is hard to generalize everyone's situation.  I'm not looking for suicide prevention, counseling or other similar help.  I have been suicidal for over 30 years and it is just the daily normal.  I have medical reasons where I don't feel it is rational to continue to suffer until natural death happens.  Yes, I know medical suicide is a highly debated topic but it is not the context of my post."

I've been trying to pretend to be happy because thats what everyone wants me to be. But i'm tired of that and i cant keep this up. The only thing thats kept me motivated is i didnt want to hurt anyone by hurting myself. But i cant keep doing this. Everyday it gets worse and worse and i dont know what to do or who to go too. So now i'm here. I really feel uncomfortable with all of this because i've bottled it up for so long. But i dont want to hurt anyone else, so i need help. I dont know how to keep going on anymore. I've wanted to die since i was 13 and its getting harder and harder to stop myself from carrying it out.

					Idk how much longer I have in me
				","

							I have thought about suicide nearly every day since the age of 14. I'm sure I have BPD and I'm a male but all the therapist and psychiatrists are too scared to give me the diagnosis. I have an identical twin brother who now for the past year has completely forgotten about me and only thinks about the girl. The only time I was happy without drugs since the age of 14 was when I was in a relationship with a girl whom I loved but eventually left me cause of my instability. I then turned from a pothead to a hard core drug addict and dealer and I'm now a convicted felon at the age of 18. I know everyone in my family would get over my death within a year or two. I thought college was my second chance to meet friends or a girl but everyone this year has so far rejected me. I've been to 4 rehabs many therapist counselors I'm on a load of pharmaceutical drugs to help my depression and anxiety. I'm thinking I'm going to overdose on heroin soon. I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel. Everyone has used me or left me as if I was nothing. I just want peace and I know I will have it once I overdose. And btw I am no longer addicted to hard drugs I haven't been for over a year since my arrest. A heroin overdose just seems perfect to me. I lived by drugs and I will die by the drugs

							I have had a very rough 6 months.  First the only woman I ever gave my heart to dumps me by text and goes to my cousin who also works with us.  I tried doing everything possible to help me get through this but nothing is working.  I cry my eyes out everyday, I throw up before going to work quite often.  I can't laugh anymore, I put on a fake smile at work.  I been researching suicide near death experiences to see what could await me.  I see a therapist weekly but it doesn't seem to be helping. My family just tells me to just get over it but I can't.  One brother actually wants to beat the crap out of me thinking that's what I need, my mom actually supports this.  I'm at my wits end, actually considering going through with it.  Not sure what else can help me.

I have done a lot of research but what I have yet to find is how to purchase the tanks? It seems as though online it is difficult to purchase - if you have a link please let me know. I found a store in my local area that sells it (some gas/air store that sells various tanks) but does anyone know if I need a license of some sort? (I live in Canada in Ontario) Also what is a common use for it so I can have some sort of backup plan and knowledge so they don't click into what I am actually planning to do? "

					27 y.o Male Virgin - Feeling very despondent
				","

							This entire year has been very hard on me. I have been dealing with some pretty bad depression and anxiety which I believe has been going on since I was a child. Ever since adolescence I adopted alcohol as a way to cope. I had my first drink at 11 years old. Since I graduated College and came home to live with my parents at 23 things spiraled out of control and I developed a serious heavy drinking problem on a daily level for 3 years. I ended up going to detox twice and finally sobered up about a year and a half ago. All of this probably in the end made my depression and anxiety worse (both were never officially diagnosed because I never went to a specialist for it). I was also an overweight kid and growing up learned how to control my weight but struggled to keep a normal weight and often gained and lost throughout my teenage years between partying and athletics. This 3 years of heavy drinking caused me to gain enough weight to reach 430 pounds. I have lost 110 pounds of this weight in the past year and a half and I am not to my goal yet... and am absolutely exhausted and discouraged. Ill probably need a tummy tuck eventually to get rid of extra skin unless I see how it rebounds at a very low weight."

							I don't think I'm going to last much longer. I've written letters to my roommates, parents, and a friend I've alienated letting them know that it isn't their fault, and that there was nothing they could have done to have prevented it. I know they're going to feel hurt and betrayed regardless, but I'm trying to make it as clear as possible that they're not responsible in any way. I don't know if there's anything else I can do to make it easier for them. I really don't want anyone I care about thinking that they could have done more, because they honestly couldn't have.

							I am a American graduate student right now. I should be happy right? No. I've been depressed since middle school, I have a loving mother but no-one else, no friends, I spend most of my time alone in my apartment. I don't get along with my siblings due to their belief that I am gay and a weirdo because I am shy. After the fight we had tonight i am convinced that they are going to have me arrested or institutionalised (I said some vitriolic things that I regret) I hate life; I've been stressed out due to the work load, which compared to undergrad is much more daunting than I had believed. Some days I wake up in the morning and just feel hopeless. I do not care about anything, tried buying things to alleviate my depression (I maxed out two credit cards) to buy video games I havent even played, two new computers, and clothes but nothing. Honestly, I just want my pain to end. I bought a twin pack which contained 196 tablets and taken 49 of them at different times, but they only make me dizzy and my fingers to shake violently."

					Trying to Support Suicidal Ex and Feeling like I'm being pulled under

							I really don't know what to do anymore.  A few months ago I had my ex committed because he was making imminent threats of suicide.  Since then I have tried to be there as a support, but whenever anything goes wrong for him it sets off all kinds of suicidal thoughts for him.  It's so scary to hear them and sad to hear the hopelessness.  In the past few weeks I feel like I am starting to lose my ability to cope.  I feel very depressed now and hopeless in my own way (that this situation will ever change).  I'm so scared of losing him and so sad that this is all happening.  I really don't know what to do.  He is seeing a doctor/counselor.  I am also seeing a counselor.  None of that is fixing the problem. All I do anymore is worry, all the time.  Any advice would be very welcome.

,"

							Growing up, I faced many challenges. I remember when I was nine years old, I would hold my breath on my pillow to try to kill myself. From being picked on by all the other guys becuase of my ""man boobs,"" if it wasn't that then they would tease me about my weight. My family made fun of my physical appereance and emotional abused me throughout my childhood. My early teen years, I developed schizophrenia. My parents, instead of finding help for me, emotionally traumatized me as they thought my illness was not real. Through my teenage years, I would be forced to stay indoors after school, on weekends, and vacations. Friends were forbiden in my family, especially for me, actually it didn't even matter because everyone in school thought I was weird anyway. With the constant state of extreme loneliness, I found comfort and a ""trip from reality,"" by talking to myself, most likely driven from my schizophrenia. I turned to drugs after high school. My monthly suicide atempts were becoming rather pathetic. 5 years pass by after high school, I lost a lot of weight and I meet Her. She was just working on a music banner outside a my hotel room during the weekend of the commericalized desert musical festival and I asked her if she needed help. No girl in high school ever talked to me, but she did. And when she communicated with me for over 20 seconds, I almost started tearing up from joy. Anyway, we got really close, She lived with me for 2 years. She never wanted to be with me though, (she had her eyes on a man from Europe who eventually came here and broke her heart), she just wanted to be friends with me though. But she wanted the affection, the love, the love making (which really was not love making- she would just let me please her and once in a while if I was extra nice to her that month she would try to please me but would give up if I took too long)--- you get the idea of how she was. Anyway, she broke my heart. I just wanted love, instead love shat on me. Now, I am back to obesity, I'm talking to myself again and live in a fantasy life, I can't even hold a job because I can't stop talking to myself and it freaks everyone out around me. I'm in my 20's, living with my not understanding parents who yell at me day and night telling me to stop talking to myself. 'Guess what mom and dad, I can't stop the voices in my freaking head!' Anyway, this post is for anyone with schizophrenia trying to find LOVE. DO NOT DO IT!!!! Love is not for people like us! We will get hurt and hurt the people we think we love. Find a THING to love, not a human being. Anway, its been ove a whole year and i havent even communicated more than 20 seconds with a girl. i just really pray for death. In the morning I wake up depressed knowing Im alive. And in the night I wish for death. So, instead of taking away an innocent life, God, please take mine away. I volunteer with open arms! because. I've already decided over 15 years ago that I wanted to die, I think deep down my 9 year old self knew that I was coming to this much pain. There is just more pain with lonesome to come. Sucks to be mentally sick and ugly! Anyway, I got a new guitar coming, going to write my last dsbm album before I end this

I guess he was thinking I would stop because of the punishment it would bring, but it didn't. So I every time I had the thought, I started to cut myself and tell myself that I'm a horrible person. I really don't blame my father, since none of knew what OCD was at the time."

							I've been suicidal quite a few times, recently earlier this year after a devastating loss, and it's something I've struggled with far too much.

All I want at this point in my life is to live on my own and go to college to seek a career path that's worthwhile, and it doesn't seem like that's ever going to happen. I'm below average in intelligence and the majority of my friends are online, which is just pathetic for someone my age. I've never had a real boyfriend or anything like that either, I feel like I missed out on a lot in my teenage years and I'm never going to get them back, and given how poor my social skills are I doubt my late teens and my twenties are going to be any better. I feel like I'm doomed to live my life as a single unwed person who's going to have to live off of welfare, and if that's the case I would rather be dead. It doesn't feel like life is worth living anymore, I don't really get any enjoyment out of it. I just don't know what to do, I feel like I can't really alter or make my situation any better either. I'm 18 years old, turning 19 soon and I have nothing to show for the years I've been alive .

She didn't tell me at first (she told me she got away originally) but about a week after she told me what really happened. I went with her and had her tested for pregnancy and stds and luckily she was all clear. It was really hard on her but she was doing really well. When we were together she seemed almost normal.

							Okay, so, here's the thing. I'm sixteen (iknowsoyoung). I've been dealing with depression and low self-steem since twelve. I've cut myself since that and I've had two pathetic suicide attempts. Right now i'm openly bisexual, i have a great girlfriend but that's the only thing it's okay so far. My family it's disfunctional as hell, I don't even live with my mom because she's working in Europe, and my father never gave a damn about me. The people I live with are my great-grandma, her daughter (my grandma's sister), my two cousins and the child of the oldest one. I'm the black sheep, who'd say. When I was twelve the school discovered my cuts (not even my family) and it was such a drama, i almost got expelled and they made me see the school's phsycologist, but I was younger and didn't want help, so as soon as school finished, I ended the sessions. My whole teenager life has been me fighting with my mom through a phone because she's never happy with me. Or i am too lazy or too antisocial or too 'rude' (because i don't greet people) or anything. I'm just not good enough for her. I'm really insecure about my body because i'm thick and overheighted but i can see I'm beautiful, like, i have a cute face and that's why I have a little confidence. The thing is, when i 'came up' i did it the wrong way. Because of my inadvertence in my school they found i had a relationship with a girl and it was a drama, again. Almost got expelled again. For that reason i had to tell to my mom and it was like, she was so mad with me because i wasn't the girl she wanted me to be (my family is religious but I'm atheist, my grades are not exactly the best, i'm really antisocial), and the homosexual thing just was the straw that broke the camel's back and since then we've been fighting even more. I'm really tired of it, all my family do is to complain about me, and so does my mom, I've been dealing through depression, and lately insomnia and social anxiety but she doesn't want to try to understand, she's just so mad I'd rather spend the whole day reading manga and texting in my bed (despite the fact I do my duties) than going to a family party. My computer and cellphone broke so I only have the tablet (my grandma's gift - where I'm actually writing this) and she wants to take it away as a punishment. As she doesn't live with me, she depends on my older cousin to this kind of things, and I refused to give it to her because this thing it's my only escape from the hell is my head. So she said she wouldn't play my school anymore if I didn't give it away. I know it sounds dumb but my mom it's really capable of it, she's that dramatic and my school is really expensive (I'm not from USA, just in case u wonder), and well, I'm just kinda tired, because I have to deal with my own demons and the manga I read and the music I hear helps me out, but if I let her take it away I'll be alone with my mind again. She thinks it's the best for me, as if that way I am going to become more social and stop being so insecure, but I'm pretty sure I'll just end up killing myself because I've had it rough this summer. School begins in two weeks and I'm already pretty anxious. I've been dealing with all this long enough, I've screamed for help, and I've tried to explain her A THOUSAND TIMES how i felt but she never understood, more like she didn't try. I know when I was younger I refused to ask for help but now I know I need it, and she doesn't even want to pay for a phsycologist. In my family there's literally NO ONE I could ask help for, I'm all on my own, I only have my friends and they can't help becase they're my same age. I've been thinking about killing myself, later or tomorrow, because it's going to be a drama about the tablet thing and i'm too sensitive and no matter the way I see it, I'll end up in the edge of desperation, but I'm a coward to kill myself, and I'm just SO TIRED. Four years, four terrible years. I don't know what to do, maybe I need a little bit of courage so I can finally kill mysef."

					The scariest feeling ever..
				","

							So yesterday I decided it was time, I've been suicidal since I was 16 and I just felt like enough was enough. So I tied my dogs leash around my neck and the other half to the banaster of my loft. I cushioned the rope and made sure the noose was on the right side to block my carotid artery. After a few attempts of trying to do it I just kept sobbing and pulling myself back up (I was doing it sitting) when finally I just let my whole body go. I felt the air leaving my brain, I saw flashing lights, next thing I know I wake up in a panic with the rope still strangling me. It was the scariest moment of my life, I didn't even remember what I was doing I felt so out of it. I kept panicking to breathe and prying at the rope because I did not want to suffocate awake. I finally got it off and just sat there bawling for hours. None of my family or friends understand, I feel so stupid..

					How do you fight off unwanted suicidal thoughts?
				","

							For anybody who has experience with this how do you fight them off?? As hard as I try I still have thoughts of just taking a knife and running it accross my throat or taking a whole bottle of some unknown pills(sorry I know that was graphic but that's how I feel most of the time). So you do you do it? I'm proud that I haven't attempted suicide in over a year and I haven't hurt myself in months but I know that one day I'll relapse  


"

							Do you remember the feeling you surely came into when your toys stopped being fun? You still liked and wanted your toys, but they slowly became ""not fun"" ... That's how I feel, but about life in general. In the same way, I have no desire to commit violence against myself. But in the same way you might want to leave an empty room or turn off the garbage disposal because the noise is just insufferable, I want to just ""leave"" life."
"
					I guess this is my goodbye....:(
				","

							I've made up my mind. This is a final goodbye, I cannot let anyone talk me out of this. This is why I am writing on a forum, so I can let it all out before I go. Im going to do this tonight. I am sitting at work right now, anxiously waiting on this evening to arrive. I have been battling severe clinical depression since April of 2014. Here I am, a year and 3 months later, and the depression has won. I can no longer deal with the pain anymore. I am so hurt. I want it all to go away. I am not looking for anyone to talk me out of this, I really just want it to end. And tonight, it will. "

							my life is not perfect - i don't have friends, i have mediocre grades, i came into conflict with like 90% of people around me (especially in school), i can't find any after-school activities that would interest me, i regularly argue with my mom"
"
					not sure what else to do
				","

							my boyfriend of 3 years broke up with me a week ago, then he came to see me last night and said he wanted to make things work, now he's saying he's not sure and that he doesn't think it will work and he doesn't want to be with me but he'll still try"
"
					Why not to commit suicide?
				","

							I m thinking of committing suicide but I m not absolutely sure if it's worth the time. I have no children nor someone who depends on me, so my absence will not harm anybody, except maybe for my mother but it will harm her only emotionally. She is the only reason i dont want to do it yet. No friends, no other family members will cry for more than 2-3 days."
"
					Maybe I'm done
				","

							Maybe I'm done with life. Maybe I'm just done. I have nothing more to give. I have tried my best in most endeavors and now I'm just tired. I feel it's time to sleep. It's time for peace. I'm depleted and exhausted. Sometimes at bed time I pray I will just fall asleep and not wake up. Not because it's all hopeless or I am helpless, but because.... I'm done.... And I have nothing left to give. I can not give what I do not have....so maybe it's just time to sleep.

					Why am I so weak?
				","

							I have opened and closed my knife so many times tonight. The tip ready to slide into my flesh bleeding me to any place other than here. My gun is loaded and ready to just have the trigger pulled. Pills on the counter ready to go. I have enough paracord tied into nooses I have my choice of color. Yet as I sit here typing I can't do it. My body seems to say I have enough to live for but all I see is a totally wasted life. I tried hard to change to better my life and yet all I have done is make it worse. Sleep is pointless because it is just nightmares of what my life is or taunts of what life never will be."

"
					my life makes no sense i'm afraid, i want to die
				","

							i hope my story won't be too long, sorry if my english isn't perfect but i'm italian, i'm a 20 year old girl and i want to die, 4 years ago when i was still in high school my parents broke up, my father used to live in u.s.a because of his job, one day he lost his job and decided to return here in italy to me and my mother(the two of us used to live alone) and he brought a woman who was much younger than him at our house saying she was a friend he wanted to help, we trusted him because he says she was going to stay with us just for a bit to find a university where she could study, in the end we found out she was a prostitute and he was ing her in our house (mine and my mothers), my mother became depressed and anorexic but there was nothing we could do since my mother didn't have a job, so we depended on my father, we had to live with them for a long time and we found out he met her in a voodoo religious cult, in the end my father decided to return in the u.s.a with this woman( after many many fights in my house). i was very depressed, in the meantime i was bullied at school terribly by 3 boys, they used to beat me up and humiliate me, i was too afraid to tell someone and the people i told didn't really believe me, i couldn't take it anymore i started becoming a very anxious person i injured myself and an obsessive- compulsive disorder, i then decided to stop going to school completely because of the terrible bulling ( they ripped the pages of my books and diary, beat me up when the teachers weren't in the classroom ,make fun of me and sexually harassing me) at that time we had many many debts to pay, me and my mother were alone when my father left and we didn't have any electicity (since we couldn't pay it) so we used candles and had cold showers till the removed water from our house so we couldn't use the bathroom or anything, my mother found a very hard job where she worked desperatly to earn something for the two of us, she had to clean in a big hotel in summer and wasn't paid very much, in the end of summer she could finally save some money to leave my old house and find a new cheap house to live in, but when we found one we discovered that the agency that was offering us the house was a scam, so they stole us 1000 euro, we called the police but they dissapeared, in the end we didn't have any house and we were desperate, i had to return to school but didn't have a place to live in, maybe because of a miracle we found a little place to stay that wasn't too expensive i returned to school but the bulling continued and i didn't want to go to school anymore i was absent for awhile till the school called my mother saying i wasn't going to pass that year, i then found the courage to talk about the bulling episodes to one of my teachers she believed me she sayd she was going to talk about it to other teachers, when she did she told me that the teachers dint't care that i have to leave my personal problems in the house and just continue studying, all the teachers started saying bad things about the teacher who wanted to help me so she became depressed and retired, i never saw her again, i was so sayd i didn't have any faith in people anymore, my only school friend started bulling me too, so the next year i decided to stop going to school and study privatly, i studied on my own but it was hard and that year i had a very big form of depression i tried suicide once but failed,  so studing became harder and harder for me, the final day i had to show up for my final year exam (after studing on my own) i failed the test, i couldn't take it anymore, people started criticizing me, saying i was lazy and i din't want to study , that i just wanted to goof around all day , but that wasn't the case i used to really love studing but the bulling was too much, i was so insecure i was afraind they would beat me up again, it hurted so much i felt like  like an object people could use, i was like a toy to my bullies i felt violated, but people couldn't understand me they just judged me, i then found the courage to look for a job but they all told me i lack experience and since i have so many economic problems i can't afford to buy myself a car or have driving license lessons( they are very expensive here) so nobody ever wanted me for a job, all my friends have parents with lots of money so they can do all they want to do, they started expensive schools have their car, they do expensive courses, i can't do anything, i'm depressed i fear people i'm anxious and i don't have friends, i have only one friend that only wants to see me when she's lonely but when i meet her it's like i'm invisible to her, and we don't have anything in common anymore, when i look at society i fear it, people all look evil and egoistic to me, i have only my boyfriend who i really love, he is so nice and kind, i would really like to be strong for him but i feel so sad, i always cry myself to bed, he has a job so even if wants to stay with me always he can't, so i'm lonely all days, i tried volounteering in a place where they offered italian lesson to foreigners from poor countries so i could feel better helping people,and find hope and trust, but one of the students was a creep, he was an aggressive man and always asked me weird things and personal stuff, so i left, i'm really sad i'd love to find kind and good people like my boyfriend, i hate our society they only base everything on superficial stuff, nobody has a heart anymore, they only think about themselfs, people only think about sex, looks, alcohol, they aren't faithfull to their loved ones, they lie without feeling shame, they betray friends, it's like humanity is ed up, i'm becoming crazy .. i think the world is too cruel i don't have the strenght to go on, i feal so weak i cry at all the horrible things i hear on the news, i cry at all the horrible things people say, i feel this hatred towards everything, i wanted to find a job and have a family with the boy i love, but i fear the world, i don't have possibilities.. i want to end it..oh and i've seen a therapist but she didn't help at all she just made me feel worst.. what can i do please help me, what can make me have faith in humanity again..is it really so cruel?

							I don't want to kill myself. I've already been there done that and know that I'm not going anywhere until it's my time to. I am just so tired of living. I'm so tired of life. I want to just go to sleep and not wake up. I have battled this for years upon years. I know what all I have to live for and I know that suicide is not the answer but it's such a nice thought. Just take the easy way out and be done. I just wanna go home.

							I know there are many reasons one might consider suicide: terminal illness, incurable physical pain, crippling debt, you lost someone you don't think you can live without, etc. I understand these reasons. But, if one of your reasons for considering suicide is because you feel alone and nobody loves you or cares about you, please take the time to read this post in it's entirety."

							I'm a twenty year old guy and I've had depression for several years now. Picked it up in high school and pretty much have had it since, getting worse and better every now and again. I don't have any talents or skills, and the only enjoyment I have in life is being around my dad. We haven't always gotten along, but he's not in very good health now and I love him. My dads side of the family has weak hearts and he's not well at the moment. I'm not strong enough to stand on my own two feet in this world. If I ever can't handle things I ask him to help me. I don't really mean financially, but he's always helped me with my problems and I won't be able to keep going when he passes away. I'm probably going to go to the hardware store about the middle of this week and buy myself a bit of rope and make myself a noose. When he passes away I don't think I'll be able to keep myself from driving out to the local bush and hanging myself off a tree."

I have some friends that I am fond of, but no ""best"" friend.   I am getting old (seriously, at 50, I am probably the oldest person on ENA).  I have always had a job, but no real career.  I no longer choose to date since all I was meeting were criminals and I have not had a boyfriend in years.   I tried church but just don't feel the Spirit, and I can't force it.  "

I thought the anxiety feeling..constant headache that never goes away, feeling tired all the time would go away after sometime but it's been more than 2 years now and It's still stronger than ever. I turned into an emotional wreck and I now have low self-esteem and no self-confidence. "

I sit and think about how good it used to feel when i slit my arms open I stopped just over a year ago. I feel no connection with my past and I feel like I have no future I feel like if I ended it life for everyone around me would be better. "

I'm scared because, I don't eat like I used to anymore I loved food, I always got super excited trying new things but now its gone, that excitement. I feel dead inside now too, like nothing phases me anymore and it scares me because I feel like an empty shell. I have no inspiration for writing or photography anymore and I fear because of that I'll fail my classes. I live in an apartment with a engaged couple that constantly insult my friends infront of me and insult me behind my back when all I ever did was defend them and even did their photography for their website and invites. I never have any money anymore so sometimes I don't really eat much to begin with because I can't afford it, I miss my mom and dad a lot but I cant bring myself to say it. I can't bring myself to tell my friends that I love them anymore, I've drifted away from many of them and I ignore a lot of them. I don't go out anymore, and I always turn down every invite I get to go out I just lay down in my bed and lock my door so I don't have to listen to my roommates making out with each other."

					Depression at its finest: Financial Issues
				","

							Ive been battling with depression for the past 7 years and it doesnt seem to be getting better. It started as a preteen when my mom and I had moved for the first time. I went to a school where it was mostly white and the kids there didnt make my experience a good one. Ever since my first encounter with ignorance, my haterd for people has escalated. However, I am a very funny and loving person with a lot of friends. I was always the popular girl in every situation, how ironic. Anyways, after i graduated high school i thought my life was finally gonna take off and i was finally gonna be happy with the life i thought i wouldnt get the chance to live. Unfortunetly, due to me not having a car at the time and my college was in a different town, i was forced to live with my father. My father is a mean and horrible person. He is a womanizer, a player and everything else you wouldnt want your daughter me to meet in a man. Yea.... i was forced to live with that if i wanted to start college. Long story short, he ended up starving me and bringing the girls he had picked up, around my living spaces. This started to bring back the depression i thought i had graduated from in HIgh school. Every second i was getting blamed for something petty and focusing on school became too much of a task. I tried talking to me mom about the situation and she just couldnt understand or probably didnt want to about what i was dealing with. I talked to my siblings about it and they helped because they all hate him too but it wasnt enough to get me through the day. "

				","

							I broke up with my ex in November of 2014 - posted about it awhile back.  I loved him so much - but I felt so taken for granted, that I was so low on his priority list.  Our relationship went by his rules - his rules on when / if we saw each other, how we behaved when, he rationalized everything so I couldn't argue, he seemed so logical that I COULDN'T - I wish I didn't see it sooner.  Once, when we argued, and I, crying, told him I wasn't a ""yeller"" during fights, he told me he knew that, and I wouldn't be with him if I was.  It made me worry that if I raised my voice he'd leave, even though that's not my personality, anyway.  We were together for three years, and made some great memories, but the feeling of being generally unimportant on an everyday basis just hurt too much.  I got tired of crying and feeling so bad for wanting or asking for something.  And when he didn't like what I had to say, I'd get the silent treatment until he cooled down, which just made me feel guilty.  The worst was four days of it; I didn't understand why, if you loved someone, and knew they were upset, why you would let them feel that way for days and days."

					I think my friend/ pen pal might have killed themself?? I need some advice!
				","

							I have had a pen pal from Denmark for a few years. And we usually chat at least a little bit pretty much everyday. We know each other pretty well, the problem is, I don't know his real friends or family. So I went on vacation at the end of October and I got back on November 7, and I wasn't able to chat with him while I was gone. When I went to go message him, his last message was on November 3rd, and he said ""man I miss your words"" With a smiley face. So I messaged him back telling him about my trip etc. I still haven't heard from him and now it's the 16th. He's told me before that he has felt suicidal multiple times throughout his life, so I'm panicking after it now being almost two weeks since his last message. I have his facebook, nobody has posted on his wall or anything, I would think one of his friends would have said something on facebook, but nothing I can see. I've also noticed like 2 or 3 of his friends have deleted him in the past few days, that really scares me. And the part that scares me the most is, I found his job profile online, and it says worked here ""November 2013, till October 2014"" That freaked me out! Does anyone know what I should do? I just want to know if he's okay or not. Should I message one of his friends even if I don't know them? What should I say without sounding weird? I tried calling his phone once and got no answer. I feel really awful right now, because I feel like if I had gotten home just a few days sooner I could have helped him. And I can't really think of any other reasons of why he just disappeared. And all the little things I'm finding look really bad, like not working at his job anymore, and people deleting him on facebook etc. Do you think people deleted him because he killed himself? I just feel terrible right now, and don't know what to do. And it's hard because he's so far away. I appreciate any advice! Thanks!

					What am I living for????
				","

							Hi, I'm feeling really down and really want to let these things out. I don't think I could ever kill myself but have been having the ¨what am I living for feeling”.                                                     I feel like I've reached the climax in my life. I've had friends, mainly from things I've been a part of... Work, youth group, game groups etc... I survived on my own for 3 years. Well I rented a room, but was very independent. Never been in a realtionship, really have no desire for it anymore. Use to live near San Fransisco and did many fun things there. One of the highlights was seeing Lion King on Broadway. I got to hangout with a guy who was a lot like a guy I'd want to be with. We stoped talking but I honesly don't feel like I'll never meet someone like that again.                                                         A little about me... I'm 23 years old am homosexual and have aspergers syndrome. If you remember Elliot Rodger the guy who mudered 6 people a few months ago. He also had aspergers syndome. While I would NEVER kill anyone, I watched some of his youtube videos and really realted to when he talked about being alone and living for just living for the beauty of nice scenary such as a golf couse that he was at. One big difference between us is the subject of love. He had strong desires for love and sex, and was so upset that he couldn't get a girlfriend, and that no girls wanted him. While I've know quite a few guys who have wanted to be with me, but I don't really have the desire for love or sex anymore.                                                                One thing I'm very greatful for is my looks. People say I look like Michael Phelps or Andrew Luck. I am a lil smaller than them, I weigh about 160. I have a high motablisim, and am very active, but still look pretty good. I have so many flaws, that a least I can feel good about something. I have a lil speach problem so sometimes people can't understand me, my jaws not alinged properly, my ribcage Isn't straight so one part of my chest is bigger than the other...                                            My biggest problem in life is my realtionship with people. I'm very mature for my age. I don't drink, do any sort of drugs, don't hang out with anyone or really have any friends anymore, and like I mentioned before not interested in love. So then I look after everyone else they pretty much are the exact opposite... Most people my age party, drink, maybe do or have tried drugs, they are usually with friends or their realtionship parter, and most people like to have sex. So most of the time I feel like I'm from mars. I don't drive so I'm usually walking everywhere I go so I'm around it all day long. I always have my headphones on, if my ipod dies it sucks. Oh another thing all the judging and geeting made fun of I have to deal with. Worst time was when I was kicked the hell out of by some kids, a few months ago. They actually broke my left arm. Scariest thing that has ever happened to me. Luckily I'm almost all healed, but probably never forget that. Everywhere I go I feel like an outcast, even at the jobs I've had.  I kind of think of most people kind of like clones. They may look, talk and act a lil different but mostly everyone likes the same things. The things I mentioned before that I don't do or get involved in. I saw the movie Fight Club with Brad Pitt a few weeks ago, and it made me think of myself. The concept of the movie was doing things different than everyone else. Lol while they did bad things different in the movie, I can realate to  living that ""differnent lifestyle”.                   Lastly I want to talk about my parents, mainly my mother. She helped me a lot in life, homeschooled me from 6 grade till the end. I did all the work but she was there to take my to all my classes to meet with the teachers. Trust me I do love her but our realtionship now is not so good. Like I said earlier, I lived on my own for 3 years, but since I've moved with them to Southern California a few months ago I feel like it was like it was before. They would scream at me, and get me so upset and then I'd just lay in bed and cry and feel so alone. It took me a couple months for my arm to heal, and then last month I stayed home and so I can take care of our dogs. She got back a week and a half ago and is pissed that I haven't found and job yet. Even though I've been going out everyday and looking for one, and even introduce myself to the hiring managers. All she talks about is how she wants me to move out and how I make the house ”toxic”. I try to talk to her, but she only wants to talk about, what SHE wants to talk about. If I talk about something she usually doesn't care. I'll get a short ”oh” or ”good”. I also try to explain to her that I takes time to get a job, and you have to wait from them to call you for an interview, but it goes on ear and out the other.  Would love to hear any advice or comments you guys have. Thanks

I really need help but I can't risk it for work. Just turned 25, celebrating my 2nd year of marriage this week, and for some reason I am horribly depressed when no one is around. I try to force myself around people to stop the thoughts or action of, but even when there is 10 seconds of silence it's pacing in my mind.

							about 2 hours ago my friend and I went into the woods and where shooting a shotgun. I never used a gun before this and sure it was fun but the whole time I was thinking about putting it to my head and pulling the trigger.

					I want to end it all, i'm sick of being a failure
				","

							Hi guys.  As the thread title states i just can't take being alive anymore and i'm seriously thinking about doing something drastic soon as i am severely fed up of existing."
,"

							I told my boyfriend I wouldn't do it, though, because his friend has an incinerator and I could see them burning my remains so nobody would find out, and then telling my family I just left. I said it half jokingly during a spat, but I honestly fear that is what would likely happen. I took a plane 2,000 miles just 5 weeks ago to be with him, here, only bringing a little luggage. The minute I arrived, meeting him at the bottom of the escalator, he made me late to get my bags, so I had to get them the next day because he wanted a cigarette. The next day, he walked so fast I couldn't keep up. It has been that way ever since. I am on a fixed income. My family is not speaking to me because I came here. I'm a single grandmother. When we arrived at his house, it was filthy beyond your worst nightmare, rivaling only what you would see in the most scary horror film ever. I was so afraid and angry and disgusted. Literally, the walls were covered with these huge spiderwebs from 8 years of neglect. Also, every surface was covered with this layer of black grease coated in what appeared to be hair, but it did not feel organic, so I cried often realizing that I must clean this, but he would not allow it at first. Honestly, I have gotten much of it cleaned and so sterile after just 5 weeks. but, I suffered cough headaches, pain in my right kidney, sinus headaches, nausea, and some was due, in part, to the filthy air quality, while some was due to having to use the strongest chemicals to combat this greasy, furry house mess. Picture the sides of the stove all covered in fur and 2 inches of horrible standing grease and filth on the stovetop. I am 50. I am disabled due to spinal trouble, but I knew if I did not push myself, the stench would kill me. He sits Indian style on his feet, which have turned purple as a result, have small wounds and I feel he is going to become gangrenous if he doesn't address this issue stat! Along with the drinking.   Every day, and the breath from it. Sitting in this manner all these years is the obvious cause of his hunchback. He also has E.D. I made the bedroom sterile and the kitchen and bathroom, as well. Oh. I bought us a memory foam mattress and new sheets. He did not even put sheets on his bed and the pillows and cases were blackened from his hair oil. He almost died 5 years ago. He is so mean, but smiles the whole time. Night after night, rejection. He won't even try. I have no place to go and I don't know anyone. I can't make friends with his people, wouldn't you agree? He needs his own friends and I need to make my own, but I have no transportation. I am so screwed. I am so depressed. I feel sorry for him because he is a monster, but he begs me not to leave, but refuses to show me any affection or to help by at least trying. At the stores he still walks so far ahead of me, and he said I deliberately walk slow ""to impede his auto-pilot."" He has had screaming mad fits at me until I cry and keep begging him to stop. I'm not beautiful anymore. I don't have hope. This feels like a trap. I met him online 2 years ago. I knew by the nature of his profession he could be a very cold person in business but he swore he would never put me through what he has put people through in his business dealings. When I get my little monthly check I wish I could go back to my old town, but my family doesn't want me anymore because I came here. He wants me to pay to have his stove fixed. I just want to save for transportation and get out. He says maybe he can find time for me on Wednesday. Funny how that coincides with me getting my little check. It is only Sunday morning. If I try to speak to him too much he will pop a cork. No one calls. No one answers my calls. No one will talk to me. I am alone with a monster who in some weird way thinks he can treat a woman this way and never visit in the bedroom and she will stay around just because he says he loves her and he thinks we can make this work out. There is so much more to it than this. It's a very sick situation. I cannot adjust. I'm cracking up. I've also got a sprain burning my skin in my upper back from all the housework. I had a multiple vertibrae spinal fusion a couple years ago, I have a fractured tailbone, and I have a hernia above my naval. I'm not strong enough to just 'get out there and get a job' anymore. You see, I would be justified in ending it. I ask myself every day, ""Really? Is this really happening? Where are the hidden cameras? How much does he make on this bet if I stay or leave or end my life, or is this some reality show and some guy is going to jump out and tell me I got punked or maybe this is the ultimate trolling just for the sake of being cruel. His words and actions do not line up. I don't understand what is happening to me anymore. Maybe he is trying to fracture my psyche so he can program me. He admitted he was using neurolinguistic techniques on me when we first met. A friend warned me he was, but, I wonder if he's not just going for the gold and trying to fracture me completely to replicate some stupid Monarch type control? I'm far too intelligent to allow that to happen, but I do feel myself freaking out a few times a day. Sorry. I know this is long. I shouldn't be talking about it, but I kind of have to. As a nam vet once said to me, ""You can't save your a** and save your face at the same time.""

							From what to start... I am dating one girl for almost half a year now, we never really get along, but we managed to go on, about 2 months back she had to go to other town (we were already living far apart, but now even more), we still were talking through skype/phone with baying apart she started to get more depressive and started to do self harm, she was doing before but I tried to help her, so she was not doing for all the time until that time ~2 months ago, and she started doing it so badly and something broke into me... I was thinking that I was helping her and it all was just even worse so I started to have my own depression, for last 2 months we argued a lot she even blocked me in skype several times, then gone back next day. I turned really bad too, when I have depression I cant do anything, I cant tell anything, do anything, because of that it went to even larger problems, but then we had bigger argument and we did not talk for 2 or 3 days, then kinda started again, then I found out that one of her ""friends"" will be coming over, the things is that  friend was her ex, she did not say me, but she posted it somewhere, so as I saw them talking and clearly she was hitting on him. 2 days after that she started to wrote to me again and later that day she asked if I will love her no matter what, I said ""only thing I would never forgive is cheating"" then after some time same day she told she had sex with her ex, but she resisted and did not want it. The thing is I knew something like that may have happened, because some time back she had one more friend with her who was trying to touch her, but she said no (that is what she told me) even if ""she actually wanted to have sex, but she will wait till we can again"".

					i want to kill myself. i am not depressed
				","

							I am 22 years old for about 4 years now I feel like I have sort of been waiting around to die. I am not depressed nor sad or suffer a mental illness. I spend a lot of time alone and don't really talk too much. I have told someone whom I trusted at one point and they called me crazy and literally never talked to me again. I don't feel crazy. Maybe its not normal to want to kill yourself but what does it feel like to enjoy life? I do love my family but am I being selfish to think such things? I guess the only reason I haven't done it is cause I'm scared of what happens next. I'm not religious I don't believe in god and quite Frankly this universe is so grand and there are so many people right here on earth its hard to believe we are significant at all. I don't know man.

					I don't know anymore. Pregnant and depressed
				","

							I am currently 29 weeks pregnant. I have suffered depression throughout my pregnancy and well before I found out that my boyfriend of four years and I are expecting our first child. This pregnancy has been incredibly hard on me, it's been very stressful and it is not what I thought pregnancy would be. I am excited to start this new path but I keep having suicidal thoughts, sometimes multiple times a day. I could never kill myself while I have a baby girl growing inside of me; depending on me. I am only 19 years old and I feel like my world is fading away. I live with my mom, I'm unemployed, and probably going to be homeless soon enough because my mom is unable to pay rent. Although my boyfriends mom has offered us her basement as a temporary place to stay, we are not staying there because I don't feel comfortable in doing so because of my past relationship with his mom. His mom has verbally attacked me on several occasions and I do not want her breathing down my neck 24/7. My boyfriend has an amazing career that pays well but it is not enough for three people to live off of. I feel so useless and helpless. Im basically counting down the days until I can comit suicide and not be anyone's burden. I feel like , making my boyfriend pay for my phone bill, food, necessities, ect, none of that is his responsibility but.. I don't know. He probably just feels sorry for me at this point. Without him paying for the things I need, I would starve our child because my mom can barely afford food. She buys a few things such as bread and milk every few weeks, but there's never a meal made inside of our home. Before I was pregnant I was depressed, because of family issues, and life. I felt like there was no point in living, like life is the ultimate joke. What. Is. The. Point? There is none. I can't wait until this pregnancy is over, everyone will be better off without me. I'm a loser.

					Single mom contemplating suicide

							I'm going to try not to write a book here... I'm 26, single mom of 4, ages 8, 4, 4 and 1. 8 year olds dad is a deadbeat;  other 3 ' dad is a drug addict and currently incarcerated. I'm currently unemployed, as I quit my job to pursue better income in adult entertainment. Due to worsening anxiety,  depression and extreme fatigue I have failed in making much income and we are newly homeless,  living with oldest sons paternal grandparents. I have recently obtained an anti - depressant prescription from gp. I guess that's the basics although there's numerous details and traumas I've experienced that I'd love to add. Basically I have decided if I am unable to provide much for them for Christmas,  I will attempt suicide via overdose and leaving home to guarantee success via hypothermia. As the time grows nearer,  I'm wondering if it makes sense to get help. The only thing is I have no child care in order to go to a psychiatrist/therapist. I've been wondering if I could/should give the kids up to social services until my mind is better and I get a job,  house,  etc. Basically any route I chose at this point hurts them. I have a hard time caring for their basic needs at this point. I believe besides depression and anxiety,  I have bipolar disorder and PTSD (former domestic violence). I don't know where to go,  I have no friends and am already burden enough to my family.

					I'm contemplating suicide again

							I can't understand the meaning of life. Surely it can't be that we wake up; work pay bills then die. Nobody loves me and I don't think that will change. All I have are lots of  people who want to use  me. If I disappeared tomorrow nobody would notice or really care. Sure some people would say ""what a waste"" but they would be fine without me. Probably wouldn't even cry. There's more love here on the Internet than in real life. The bills are ever present and overwhelming. There's no escape. There's no real happiness anywhere. To know you mean nothing to anyone is pretty harsh. I used to believe that it was a sin to kill myself but now I don't know that I believe in God so its less of a deterrent. So I'm lying here in bed thinking about killing myself and not feeling as concerned about it as I think I should. Just very dispassionately and logically about mechanisms.

							I doubt this will be read. This is the first social anything i have ever done. I like being anti social, the only problem with it is when things get tough i dont have any one to talk to. My life as a dairy farmer, i am in control of the whole running of the property. A contract Milker. The owners are not on the property or hardly around, that is a nice thing, something you dont get too often. When you know you are doing everything you can you don't want the owner looking over your shoulder saying 'Why didnt you tell me about this' when his response would have been to do the action i took. My man of 4 years i met dairy farming for his parents. Before that i was in a stable relationship of 3 years and befreo that, like young and underage, i was promiscuous and a workaholic. I dont even know how to describe how i have gotten where i am. and maybe there is no point and im just writing a piece of crap history in my life that wont help and i just have to keep going? Im afraid of the pain of commiting suicide and im afraid of the person it will hurt. I think i Love him still. but sometimes he is my problem. he is a dairy farmer: contract milker: on the same farm. we are in a contract together making us completely equal. but we are never equal. i hate bagging on him so ill start with the good parts. he is really handy with his hands, like can fix anything (when he wants), if i cant do something ion farm and ask for his help (there might be an argument) but he  can get it finished or help me achieve to get it finished. he is better at curing rotten milk cows than me. and i USE to learn things from him. but 3 years ago when we left his parents farm we went contract milking: he has been dairying since he was born so has more practical knowledge than i will ever gain. and he thought it was the right step. but half way through the year it was me feeding the cows, me making sure the fertilizer was on at the correct time to have feed for the cows, me doing the mating detection to be ready for artificial insemination, me raising the calves, me getting up every morning to make sure everything was working like clockwork. im slightly one of those likes to be organized people. also he inhales the horrible green plant. that i hate with an almighty passion. i think that is what makes him lethargic. anyway im off point i just lose track and mumble. there are so many different issues that have put me into this stage of my life. childhood, adolesence, young adulthood. half my life is over. (ive never planned on getting unmobile: freaks me out) and i cant imagine haviong to go through all this hell twice over just to get my original dieing date. why cant i just go skydiving with a knife and cut the straps after i jump."

							Hi. So, I don't have social anxieties. Making friends has always been very easy. Girls don't get under my skin because I don't let them get close enough to hurt me. I'm successful at work, although that means I work 18 hour days. But I just don't see the point. Life is a biological process geared towards procreation. Society and culture can butter it up and invent all manner of strategies but we are simple here to fulfill a animal impulse to spread. I do believe in a creator. But that doesn't give me any sense of well being in this current form. I just don't want the life that the modern world offers. What does that leave us? I don't know, but this is all a bit pointless and silly to me. Humans seem so petty and underdeveloped in their desires and emotions. I would truly like to find a cause or position that required me , but without love for the species or desire to add to it. Now what?

							It probably sounds ing stupid. This girl I've know (sort of) since 7th grade (5+ years).... about 8 months ago, she said she had feelings for me. She lives in PA, me in AZ. It built up, until she said ""I love you"".... It felt SO amazing. So, six months ago, she made plans to fly out, and we were going to do a first date, then go to Las Vegas, then sight see in AZ. The first day was a relax day. We cuddled, and watched an entire day of movies, before I took her to a nice restaurant for our first date. At the end of the night, as I agreed, she went to sleep in my room, and I went into my spare bedroom. We hugged, I said ""I love you"" and she said ""I love you too"". "

					Feeling numb... my life is falling apart
				","

							I am feeling very low tonight. Things in my life are falling apart... everything. My past has been a mess and it is affecting my now. Family, relationship, work, everything is falling apart. I have no more joy, I am in a very dark depression and no one seems to care... even when I reach out. Funny thing is I fear death, but feel as though I will never get out of this hole I call my life. I guess I just wish the people I cared about cared enough to see the pain I am in, my cries for help but they don't.....

					Everyday is a struggle

							I am such a miserable person. I can't find the joy in anything. No matter how much I try to be normal, there is that quiet voice telling me I am different. Ever since I was a child, I've had depressive moods and emotions. I am highly sensitive and any type of adversity makes me cry or feel overwhelmed. Right now, as an adult, in my mid-20's, I am trying to hold onto a job. The longest I have stayed in a job was 2 months. I am trying to find something I can do, but I just can't relate to people or find myself doing anything. This has been going on for years because I've been depressed all my life. There is something wrong with me, why do I constantly feel this way? My parents told me that I always used to say, ""I can't"" and now I say it again, ""I can't"". Honestly, it feels like I am close to the edge of giving up everything. I just want to be erased and never heard of ever again.

					I have tried to kill myself twice

							I have tried to commit suicide numerous times.  I am 23 and i feel like dying.  My mom hates me, my sister only cares about her boyfriend and I am too self-conscience and shy to do change anything.  My dad  was the only one that cared about me and he had  horrible and painful death so every aspect of good in my life got taken away from me.  Every girl I run into is disgusted by me, why should I bother trying this is a cry for help and I don't know where to run.  The doctor prescribe pills but all they do is give me stomach aches and the only thing that makes me feel anything is alcohol.  Please I don't know what to do. I cry myself to sleep every night and I am don't know what to do.  Has anyone been through this before?

							I was assaulted a year ago and well in order cope with it (b/z the school psychologist sucked) I did everything I wasn't. Joined a sorority, drank, did drugs and my grades spiraled down (mind you I was an A student on a premed track). I met a guy 6 months after the assault, thought I was in love and lost my virginity to him. Yeah dumb move only dated him for what 3 months. Anyways the relationship with the new guy became toxic. Flashbacks came back and I tried to kill myself. I survived and endded up in the psych hospital.  I had a flashback of the assault attacked the new guy and he had me arrested. He said he thought I was gona rape him. Even made a video to show cops. A stay away was issued and well since we still 'loved' each other we talked. Then he disappears and after a week sends and email saying his mom has has spyware installed to monitor him and that if she catches him talking to me she will tell the police and send me to jail. Sounds like crap because hes been chatting up with one of his old friends who tried to break us up in the beginning and whom I specifically said I did not like his association with. He hurt me so much that I just lost it and took some pills again and was hospitalized. I called him from the hospital, left him a message he never got back to me. Apparently in his last email he also mentioned how he was hospitalized cuz he tried to hurt himself. He is going through his own family issues BUT you do not decide to just kill yourself one morning. I know that and I know him. "

							I'm giving up, I'm killing myself. I'm not ashamed to give up because I never signed up for this bull. People are always saying things like: ""well you're not willing to fight"". That's true and I'll admit it. I'm giving up. Life is ing tough and I want out. I'm tired of having to fight myself just to be happy. I'm tired of being in a perpetual state of loneliness. No one loves or wants me, in the true sense. People can say words. I know that because when someone in my ""family"" tells me they love me, I say words back. I know that those words are supposed to be ""I love you too"", so that's what I say. And that's how I know they don't mean it. I've come close to finding love twice, only to have it snatched away from me right when I could taste happiness. I've never needed anything in my life as badly as I've needed someone to love and to be loved back. Of course though, that's only bound to fail and leave me miserable as well. Why? Because I've already put the survival of my happiness (and by extension, me) into two different girls hands, just to have them both crush my heart entirely. Even if I was willing to put everything on the line for a third time, I wouldn't be able to find anyone. I was neglected and abused my entire childhood, which made it impossible to connect with anyone on a real deep level. Despite that, I fought through every bad thought that told me that this was a bad idea and I would get hurt because I knew that what I wanted and needed was for someone to love me. Guess what happened? I got my heart stomped on twice. I even told the second girl about the first and how she treated me. I mean I must have just given her ideas to use against me. The second girl was the one I was closest to and still to this day I can't really shake. She has no idea what she did to me. I say that because she sent me a happy birthday message a couple of months after I was released from a mental hospital. I was in there for an attempt, but she didn't know that. So she sends me some message about how she hopes that this year is the happiest for me and all that bull. Well I snapped. This was the only person I genuinely felt cared for me, but we hadn't really talked since she broke my heart 2 years ago; however, she used to tell me that she still did care for me just not love me. Within that 2 years, I had been steadily circling down the drain (and still am) until I eventually landed in the hospital. Her, she was just casually dating until she found the love of her life and got pregnant. I was aware of this of course and it wasn't a truth that helped my depression. I'd go look at pictures of her on social media and see her post things about her boyfriend like ""he's the most amazing person I've ever met"", "" he's the best person I know"", etc. You know, normal things she would say/should say about her boyfriend. But those are also the things she used to tell me when I was depressed. I can count on one hand the things that people have said to me that made me feel good, happy, whatever, and they all came from her, but now those things don't mean . Mostly because she never meant it with her heart and also because she doesn't mean  to me anymore. So as I said, I snapped. The whole time I'm over here contemplating suicide and reminiscing about how I used to be happy with her, she's over there happier than she's ever been. That's why I just lost it when she told me happy birthday. If I didn't know any better, I'd think that she was just ing with me but no one's that evil. That's just one tiny little reason why I've decided lately to hang myself. And don't give me the whole it's better to have loved bit because I never got to love her or the first girl. The way it worked out both times, I became their best friend and couldn't be any closer to either of them. Was I rewarded with a healthy relationship? No. I was just immediately friend zoned and made to continue missing out on that which humans require most. The first girl's excuse was that I was a pothead atheist. And I  you not, that is exactly what that girl has become now. The second girl's excuse was that her father hated black people so we would ""never have been able to have anything real"". As I said, that's one tiny reason why I'm hanging myself. I can't keep treading water in this hell by myself. I have no one. I called my mom once while I was in the mental hospital. Out of everyone in my family, I'm closest the least to my mom, but I still called her. I only asked her one thing and that was to tell my carpool that I wouldn't be there for a week. That's all I said and that's the only person I talked to the whole time. I just sat there for a week straight, completely alone, crying to myself. I promised myself in there that once I got out, I wouldn't allow myself to continue suffering this lonely existence and I intend to keep that promise. I guess I'm just gonna hang myself with my belt. I've done a few practice runs and have experienced what its like to almost slip into death so I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. I just wish my life wasn't so that I'll only be found once the smell of death drifts from my room."

							Hello, my name is Fro. I have been self harming for the longest time, and you see I have made the decision to attempt suicide..again. Of course I have a reason behind it, my past and the present. You see the nightmares, the bullying, and life just got me tired and I want to go to sleep forever and I don't want to wake up and I just want to be dead. You see my 'friends' aren't really my friends. Its just me helping them through there problems and then when I need help I am ignored. Is that what friends do? Is that how its supposed to be? I don't think it is but that's all I know. My friends are tired of me, I am tired of me, and my family is tired of me. The nightmares are getting to me, the bullies are getting to me, and lastly I am getting to me. I just want done I am done with life. They are gonna fake cry over me, and then a year later I will just be a distant memory. Please, don't make me feel worse than I already do. I just need ways to kill myself. Last time I downed a bottle of pills and ended up in a mental hospital. Yeah so much 'fun', but you see when everyone just looses hope in me..I loose hope in me too. I am just Done, and I am ready to go. I know there is no heaven/hell so no consiquences for my death. I am ready to depart. I am tired of living.

							As the saying goes, when it rains, it pours.  Well lately it seems that I am stuck in some torrential downpour that I can't get out of.  Lately it seems that I ave made a real mess of my life.  Things started going wrong when just about 10 years ago, my husbands mistress called to let me know that she was engaged to my husband and much to my chagrin, my now ex told me he was in love.  The divorce process was exhausting, had it not been for the fact that I was pregnant with our 5th child, I think I would have ended things a long time ago but I couldn't harm an innocent.  In between him not realizing that I was a human with feelings and his mistress calling me a  because he told her our children were from another man, I believe I went emotionally numb.  I lived in a few shelters for sometime before I became stable and then five years down the road, I had an emotional breakdown that led to the loss of my job.  On top of that, despite swearing the children and child support off, Mr. Ex said that he wanted full custody.  Although I have the promise of a new job, the pay will won't even help to make ends meet."

							I guess I can't remember the last time I was happy or liked myself..even when I was younger. Everyone talks about how happy their childhood was and I seemed to have blocked mine, I don't really remember anything but the things I do remember are horrible. When I met my now ex I felt so much better like someone actually cared about me, I couldn't even bring myself to hug family members, I was very emotionally stunted but he brought me out of my shell and lifted me up. After a while though the goodness wore off and things got tough for me and I started to self harm. A lot of bad things have happened these past two years but he's always been there for me. Now he's left me and I'm ill and two of my family members are seriously ill and I'm probably going to fail college but I can't leave otherwise we'll get kicked out of the house and I just have too much going on and too much to cope with."

							For the last five months my whole life has been dedicated to band. For any of you who have been in nice marching band would understand how much time goes into it. In this time I stared to bond a lot with my section. There was one guy who I perticularly took an interests to. We had the same music taste, the same interests, and the same goals and ideas. We became quick friends and started to hang out all the time. One evening we were at rehearsal and it was going normal . Everything was fine when we all went home for the night . However, in the morning my heart sank when I walked into the bandhall and saw him crying. Up to that point he was the happiest person I had ever seen. He always had a smile and was making everybody laugh . Later that day he told me that his friend (ex girlfriend) had killed herself . And that they wernt on good terms. It has been about eight weeks since and he is doing a lot better . When she died he opend up to me. He became my best friend and I was determined to help him through. We have gotten so close since then. I also let him in deeper than Ive let anyone else. We both have a lot of scars and hurt that we have been through . Lately he has been the reason I uget up in the morning. But I can't shake this feeling of loneliness . I need someone there for me all the time that I can turn to for everything. I couldn't think of a better person than him. I told him I liked him and he feels the same way . But he is not ready for a relationship and I completely understand. But for me , I can't be alone anymore . My ex boyfriend whom I was still with at the time killed himself about a year ago.  I haven't even touched a man since. I need it . And  this guy who I have come to love can't do it for me . And even though he means so much to me I can't wait. I am a pretty young lady and I will have no trouble to start dating . But its not what I want.  I just need to feel something. I know I won't loose him as I friend if I date other people but I will probably loose any chance of being more than that in the future . I feel like I'm being selfish , but I'm trying to put myself first for once in my life . And I know I'm young (17) but I have been through so much. I know there will be other men but none that can say the things him and I can . The things we've worked through together.  For the first time in a long time I'm happy . So is it worth it to wait however long it may take and be lonely to the point of severe depression. Please help me gather my thoughts.

							I really need help. I don't know what to do though. I feel suicidal all the time, and self harm always seems like the right way to go.. I feel like no one actually cares about me, I don't really feel close to anyone at all, and there just doesn't seem to be anything to live for.. I don't come from your typical all-american family. I was sexually, physically, and emotionally abused as a child. I was bullied in school because growing up, my family didn't have very much money, so I was forced to wear clothes that often times didn't fit and weren't really ever ""in style."" When I was sixteen, I met a girl who seemed to change my life. She would always make me smile, and whenever we hung out I was truly happy, which I hadn't been in a very long time. But things changed somewhere along the way.. About three months into our relationship, I moved in with her, because her mom realized how bad my situation was at home. But the problem was, after about a month or so, I started to feel as if I didn't want to be in the relationship any longer, but I was too nice and cared too much for her to break it off. Now we're sixteen months into our relationship, and I'm torn down the middle. Eventually I want to get back together with this girl, and maybe even get married, but right now, I want to date other people.. I'm not sure where to go and what to do anymore.. If I break up with her, I have to go live with my mom again, who is a very abusive person. If I stay with her, I'll never get the chance to date other people and see if this girl is actually the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. Please, someone help me.. I don't know where to turn and what to do..

I did a lot of work for them, but just didn't feel happy. I only got a small sum of money from them when I left, I was angry and grateful for it. Since then I tried posting my CV to places in person.

I hear it all the time in public, I get a lot of people staring at me, whispering about it and saying stuff like ""I bet she has a sparkling personality,"" etc.. I look really ugly and like a man. I wasn't always ugly though.. in fact a year ago I looked just fine. I had an eating disorder and after I got to a proper weight, my face started changing and for the worst.. I'd never been called ugly in public until summer of 2013, I didn't even notice how much my face had changed. Someone on another answering site said it's probably because I tampered with the levels of subcutaneous fat in my face and since I got my eating disorder during puberty (I was almost 15) and that it's very likely my eating disorder could have changed my face because I probably got rid of muscle and subcutaneous fat when I developed it (I was eating like 500-1000 calories a day and dropped 45 pounds in 5 months) Which is a lot considering I wasn't even overweight to begin with. But now I am severely depressed, I can't go outside because I got really sick of the nasty comments, I get laughed at at school, I have no friends because of social anxiety.. and being ugly is making it 200% worse.  I honestly do not care about anything except how ugly i am and I'm set on getting at least 50k of plastic surgery because I can't accept it.. I can't be happy ugly and that's that. I like shopping for clothes and it's no fun at all when you're ugly, I hate being the ugly/plain friend so I don't even want any friends. My future feels hopeless until I get plastic surgery. I really want to fall in love one day but I doubt anyone will before plastic surgery with the ugly face I have. I want to get tattoos and piercings but again that's no fun when you're ugly..  It's not fair, there are literally zillions of DNA combinations and I get stuck with THIS one.. "

							I have had suicidal feelings  every now and but not for a couple of years. It all happened when I met a girl a week ago and now we are going for a date next weekend.But one day after meeting this girl I felt depression coming and now I have been in depression about five days. I have been using medication (Efexor depot) before but not at the moment. But is why this depression comes when things are going to a better direction? I am having these feelings that I cant live for a much longer and that I want to kill myself.I am 29 years old now  and I had really bad depression 5 years ago and this time it is not that bad, but if I am thinking about killing myself... I still keep up my happy image so nobody knows.So if you hame something helpful words I would like to hear..

							It started with me moving a cross country after deciding to move in with my boyfriend, and him telling me after I changed everything for him, that it wouldn't work between us. We fought a lot and for a long time. Us trying to make it work, and fighting about everything. I've been very vocal about what I wanted to do to my boyfriend, his best friend and another commun friend, both to try and feel better about it like venting and both because I wanted my boyfriend to help me. I ended up in the hospital after taking all my pain killers. I have fibromyalgia. My heart stopped, I had to be monitored for a week. During this week, my boyfriend tried to be there for me but in the end he told me, while being in ICU, that it was too much for him to handle and he needed a break. Side note: when he was in a similar situation I never left his side. "

Reality is harsh and I have no interest in being a part of it. Recently I told my mother about how I have been feeling this way for quite a while. That was a huge mistake. I'm sure that she did not mean it to come accross in such a way but the conversation that ensued served mainly as a list (from my perspective) of some more reasons that I might as well die. Among this list was my lack of motivation, or interest in anything not pertaining to video games and the list was finished with ""either you find a way to be interested in school or you go to a hospital"".

I am prone to getting depressed easily and have been to a psychologist in the past only once, but I refused to go back.  I figured I could deal with my depression and anxiety on my own, and for the most part I have been able to, but usually it has never lasted this long (two weeks now).  It feels like everyday slows down further in order to optimize the feeling of hatred that I have for myself and for my life.  There were a few catalysts, namely my boyfriend broke up with me, and then my best friend got mad at me because I was being emotional and has stopped talking to me, then my boyfriend came back to me, but then people told him about a past situation of mine (from five years ago), which angered him and he broke up with me again.  Piled on top of that that people are being very spiteful and mean to me or just not caring at all that I'm truly despondent."

							I've been in a pretty bad place, mentally, lately. I could go down the list of things going on in my life that have left me with no real will to do anything. I've just divorced my wife who, for our entire relationship, has lied and cheated on me with three (from what I know) different men. Currently, I'm a single father and I've had to move back in with my parents because at the moment, I'm a ""starving artist"". My parents and I don't speak. To this day, I can't recall a single conversation between my parents. It's been that way since I was a child. They never showed any affection or emotion to me... or to each other for that matter. When I told them I was getting a divorce, my father just looked at me and my mom told me to get over it. I must add that they are my adoptive parents and I don't know anything about my biological parents. I'm almost 15 now and I've got no idea what to do with myself. I've done my best to focus on my art and be a good father but I seem to be getting nowhere. It's been hell trying to find an actual job due to the decisions I made when I was 18-19 years old to sell drugs and do a lot of other things that I have long since given up. It didn't take long for me to realize that the life I was leading was going to get me nowhere but dead or in jail. I've spent the last few years rebuilding and making sure that I live my life right. Everyone says that they love my photographs but I have made very little money from them and it's getting harder and harder to get up everyday and do what I love knowing that I'll likely not see any profit from any of this until I'm too old to appreciate any of it."

							-This is long.  If you make it through, you're a saint.  I've been down lately... like, seriously down.  I'd normally never admit this, but I've been having dark thoughts the past couple days that involve hurting myself and it's scaring me.  It scares me because before, no matter how blue I got, I knew I'd never actually do anything... but now that line is becoming a bit blurred.  A couple months ago I ended a 5 year relationship.  I cared a lot for this person, but their inability to hold a job for more than a few months was wearing me thin.  I know what you're thinking... if you stuck around with that for 5 years it's your own fault.  But it's not that simple.  We connected... really connected... and both in our mid twenties when we met.  I thought there was hope... that they just needed someone to guide them.  I was there once, so I could relate to the desire to get your s**t together but not having the slightest clue how to go about it.  Well during this process, when the recession hit back in 2000-whatever, I lost my job.  We were living off of my unemployment and the occasional contribution from my partner.  At that point I was dependent on those contributions, no matter how small, just to make ends meet.  I took out a title loan on my car to try to cover rent once my savings ran dry.  I wound up losing the apartment anyway, and the car as well.  So there we were... broke and sued for the remainder of the lease plus legal fees which came up to several thousands of dollars.  We found a seedy little place that didn't ask too many questions (because I was just evicted and sued, my options were pretty much ZERO) and moved in.  The place was infested with cockroaches and no matter how hard we tried we couldn't kick them.  I had found a part-time temp job by this point, and one day at work a roach crawled out of my backpack in the break room in front of about a dozen people.  There was ghasping and other unpleasant reactions.  I was so humiliated I ran to the bathroom and cried.  About an hour later I was told my assignment was over and not to come back.  "

					22 day of NC: wishing myself a fast and painless death
				","

							My ex boyfriend of 7 months (the serious and the perfect one I was living with) broke up with me 22 days ago by confessing me that he was spending all this time with me because of convenience and not because he loved me. He said that love has disappeared at the time we started living together induced by my monotonic lifestyle, busy work-at-home schedule (he always went to sleep alone and I was still working) and the fact that not only his friends saw nothing interesting in my personality, but all of his family wished him to break up with me sooner because I wasn't the type they imagine in their circle (financially poor and totally dependent on him). He was living with me, hearing all those negative words about me from his family members, as well as wishing to know the painless way to break up with me and not to break my heart into pieces (emotionally I was head over heels for him and he was everything to me)."

I moved to his area from out of state and my family members that I've been living with have decided to send me back to my hometown, so I won't be able to see him very much, but we've decided to continue our relationship despite the long distance. I'm really worried about him though because he says that thinking about me not being here makes him really depressed and I'm afraid that he might try to commit suicide while I'm away. I don't think there's anyone in his life that I can talk to about it that would stay cool about it and watch over him to make sure he's content and I don't know what to do other than reassure him that I'll stay faithful and talk to him everyday. Thinking about it brings me to tears, I'm just so scared for him.

							Hello. This is my first time on this site but I just needed help. Needed someone to speak to. I'm scared. No I'm terrified. I've been ill with clinical depression since I was 13 (I am now 18 ) and I am on strong medications for it. I have had rough points as well as slightly higher points, as everyone does. But my rough points have been bad. I've tried to commit suicide 4 times now. Each time being caught and stopped by someone. And now....I thought I was better, then something happened. The only friend, the only one I have left in this pathetic world left me. Hates me now. Because I messed it up. I'm poison to others, I destroy them. So many people have left me and they never come back all because I'm a bad bad person. So right now, I'm scared, because I....Well I want to die, but I' scared to, I'm scared by this feeling. Scared that my family would never forgive me. Scared of the pain of death. But I just see no other options left.

					Reocurring suicidal ideation
				","

							I don't know where to begin, but for years whenever I've been feeling down suicide has always been a thought/mild consideration. Is this normal, do most people consider suicide through their life? I know at this point I could never go through with hurting my family but sometimes I just get so fed up with all the stress I feel, that I have nobody to talk to about. There is not a single person I can look at and comfortably tell them that I think about killing myself from time to time, that I obsessively worry about my looks & finding a girlfriend, that I'd be 100% willing to be in an abusive relationship and that I cry over something or another about once a week or more(like right now). Compounding this I have job that I hate, it's third shift which adds onto me worrying about my looks. I know this would so petty to someone with actual problems but to me it's all so real and it's just really hard to have to feel like I'm going through it alone. I don't tell friends or family members all this because the last thing I need is there harsh judgment. Who knows what my friends would think, I'm always so aloof, light hearted and charismatic around them, I don't need them judging me or thinking I'm frail (although I really really am). I have a few girls who are interested in me and they seem like such nice people but the physical attraction just isn't there and I don't want to lead them on. I've been told by people before that I should seek therapy but I'm on my dad's insurance as his is better than the one my job provides me with so I couldn't get it without him finding out, and I'm strongly against the idea of medication. I know this post was really arbitrary, it was a bit of a rant but advice would be appreciated.

					my epic fail
				","

							So im 22 years old I have had many suicidal thoughts. I have done almost everything like cutting my wrists down the road trying to bleed out and i even tried to cut so deep to my femoral vein in my leg to bleed out.I ended up not going deep enough and stitches. I have researched options like drinking household items or eat rat poison. I decided on non of those because I could just end up on life support and that would be worse. I would get in fights with my boyfriend and have him tell me he doesn't want me. Most of the time that triggers this emotion like if he doesn't want me I dont want to be in this world. I wanted an easy way out. So a little background is I do have a drug problem im not currently talking to a therapist of anything. I have been very broke and decided I will find a way to mess myself up so bad Ill need painkillers for a long while. Some I could sell and some that I could get high. So I made a deal with a few friends to break my knee I told them I would give them part of the pills i get so they could sell em and make money. First I had my friend swing a metal pipe at my knee 4 times well she missed a couple and hit my shin. I read that a blow to the knee can tear ligaments. "

							I'll admit... I suffer from BPD, and the ups and downs are pretty nasty. They make me feel awful. But my major qualm is that I'm in physical pain 24/7. When I say that, I'm not exaggerating. If I take over the counter aspirins it helps a tiny bit. If I take narcotic painkillers, it helps a little bit (if I can even get my hands on some). Nothing seems to truly rid the pain from my body. Reasons for my pain: TMJ, IBS, GERDS, excessive dental carries, hemicrania continua, and more (disabling depression, anxiety, nausea). Mostly treatable things if you can afford to pay the huge medical bills. I can't. No insurance. Rejected for medicaid twice. I am so so so sick and tired of being in pain. This has been going on too long and I am just fed up.

							this is my first post, so i'll try to be brief. i don't feel like i have any true friends. yes, i have some people i talk to and see outside of school, but when it comes to stuff like that, i'm always the second person. what i mean by that is unless it's me and one other person talking one-on-one, no one even acknowledges the fact that i'm a part of the conversation. i'm not a first priority in anyone's eyes. i also am not to fond of my life as a whole. i see others in the hall ways, enjoying school, enjoying their friends, enjoying their life. then i get jealous and start to wonder ""why is my life not even filled with the slightest amount of happiness/fun"". i always find myself sulking around, trying to talk to people (but obviously in vain). i just feel that i suffer the most, work the hardest, try to be the nicest, be the best listener, and i always get the short end of the stick; i never get any appreciation. and of course the one thing i want the most (or pretty much everyone for that matter) is to be in a loving relationship. i never feel that i'm more than ""just casual friends"" with classmates, girls, anyone. add all these factors plus my incredibly negative personality and depression problem, and you get the basics of my daily life. but the thing is i know these people care about me, i just never see it displayed/on at least a semi regular basis. i just want to feel like i matter to people."

							Lots of people are not great sleepers.  Mine is very serious.  I stay up from 10am to 2pm often trying to sleep and as soon as I sleep for an hour or two I wake up again.  This has been going on for two years.  I can't remember the last time I had a full night sleep but I think it was 3 months ago.  I keep having to call in sick because if I don't sleep at least 2 hours then I just cant work., I wake up at least once sometimes four times a night since then I cant sleep at all.  I do all the right things.  Even take sleeping pills now and they barely work.  Tried melonin which backfired.  I dont eat too much before bed.  I open my window.  etc and etc  I tried some relaxation techniques that worked the most but not near enough.  My brain just does not stop thinking, I keep going round and round.  Even when I am able to slow my brain down I still toss and turn endlessly.   I tried imagining a magic world that worked when I was a kid.  Nothing works now.  I think lots stress (lots of family problem with my parents, in-laws, brothers, sister) and my two small kids waking me up at nights a few years ago did me in.  Before I would try to sleep for an hour and I will and would never wake up ever.  A few months ago, I had a span of five nights in a row where I slept great (probably I had 10 good nights the whole year) but my friend did something horrible to me and I was back to square one.  If I have one horrible night, it takes me weeks just to get even slightly better even when the original problem that caused it is not even on my mind anymore.  I have a wonderful life but even the fun things are very difficult, it is just about making it through the day.  I feel horrible ignoring my kids, my wife doing the parenting alone on many days and letting my work down despite my boss being very nice about it.  It just never ends.  Please help!!!!  I don't know what is going on with me.  Doctors could find nothing.  I cant live like this.  I have heart pain now too for some reason.  If someone has any new ideas that can work, I would be grateful.

					I'm in a really bad place and I'm all alone
				","

							I've been self-harming for years, but this year things started getting alot worse. It wasn't just feeling upset and getting better after a little while, it's pretty much constant. I've pretty much lost all hope and I feel stupid for even asking for help because really my life isn't that horrible when compared to others and I know that other people have things happening in their lives too. I feel so guilty about imposing myself onto them. Most of the people I would usually talk to just can't be bothered anymore. I think that they're sick of me and might even hate me cuz now all they see is this pathetic broken creature who's simply fighting against what's more or less fated. It's not necessarily that I want to kill myself, it's more that I desperately want it all to stop. I want all the pain to go away and I don't want to have to go through any of the bad things again. I'm constantly being called a  or a , but I've only ever kissed one boy, and that was this year, the boy promptly informed me that he was interested in a sex only relationship with me and nothing emotional because as he said ""I've been through so many bad relationships lately and I just want something casual"" then about three weeks later he has a girlfriend. That actually happens tome alot. My ""friend"" has decided she hates me cuz I'm friends with a boy she is also friends with. Everyone just deserts me when I'm in a bad place because they can't be bothered. It's like screaming into a void- no one hears me. No one helps me. I just want things to stop hurting so much, I want the to get better, I want to believe that I can afford to care about things again and that I can have real hope again and that I deserve it. Right now all I can think is how much better the world would be without me- there would be a little less darkness, no one would have to worry, no one would even notice I bet.

					single mother at the end of her rope..
				","

							Ok... I'm so sick & tired of living my life. "
"
					I don't want to live looking like this, the past is haunting me..
				","

							I know this sounds really shallow but I really am ugly. I look like a man. I have a really bad nose, it's big and it has a bump in the bridge of it. My pores are really huge and they stand out. My jaw is slightly too big  and I just resemble a man a lot. I literally can't go anywhere without being called ugly and it's making me really depressed. I also have social anxiety and I'm very socially awkward. I have no friends left because I lost them all out of depression, and when I think about it I don't deserve friends. I used to talk behind their backs, sometimes even be a  to their face just for a laugh, I stole a couple things from my friends, blame them for things I did. I used to joke around about really serious stuff to the point where if anyone with a lot of morals heard me I'd probably be beaten to death. I'd make fun of people for no reason, I thought creating drama and starting fights on the Internet with people was the best thing. I called this girl fat a while ago and she ended up at my high school, told everyone what I said and my cousin ganged up on me with her (my cousin and I used to be best friends) and told everyone about how I don't even deserve friends because of the way I treated them and told them all about making fun of other people and even some of the nasty things I said. I don't know why I did it or said it, this all happened when I was 13. I'm turning 17 on the 13th now but it's well known around the school and now everyone is judging me based on the way I acted. I lost my very last (and first) best friend because I am just not fun to be around anymore and my depression really shows, plus she's an extreme extrovert and has tons of friends and loves to be around as many people as possible. So we just grew apart because of that. My cousin told everyone I stole a couple of her things and some of the mean things I said and did, the way I talked  about my old friends. Yeah now everyone knows what a ty person I was.. so it's not like I have a high chance of making any friends. I haven't made a friend since I got here more than 4 years ago. I have depression, nothing interests me anymore, I'm afraid to go outside because whenever I do I hear someone whisper ""she's f*cking ugly,"" or I bet she has a sparkling personality to make up for it. Some strangers even look at me and chuckle to themselves openly. Everyone thinks I deserve it because I called that girl fat (and a few of her other friends) a long time ago. I was just really immature, bratty and ignorant. Also whenever I pass my cousin now on the streets she makes a point of raising her voice just so I can hear her insult me out loud, her friends that go to my school laugh hysterically at how ugly i am everytime i see them and are spreading the way I acted before around.  It's too late to apologize now. They'd probably call me desperate because I have no friends trying to apologize..  I truly am sorry and repulsed by the way I acted but I'm afraid to apologize. I also really hate myself for stealing my friends' things. I honestly had a fair amount of great friends over the years I treated like sh*t for no reason sometimes, especially behind their backs. I'm afraid to go outside, I spend all my time on the computer and I hate myself for it knowing that I'm going to look back on my teen years like this. Do you think i deserved everything I've gotten? I really just want to die. I've had enough, someone makes a nasty remark at me each day, even strangers. Guys give me dirty looks on the bus and a couple times they go to sit beside me, see my face and then quickly move to another seat. Even when I go to a family pool party I hear it because my cousin is there and has to retell the story about me stealing her things and sh*t in front of me to her bf just to piss me off.  I'm a better person now and obviously I've learned my lesson. I know karma doesn't exist.. but I really hope that I never made anyone feel as bad as I've felt the past year. I can't go a day without crying. I just don't have any motivation to do anything, my social anxiety is terrible, I'm empty and depressed, I don't care about anything. I never have fun and it hurts. I feel like it's never going to get better living in this area of my city. I'm too awkward for a job please give me advice i actually have been thinking about suicide a lot

							My desire is to help those with emotional difficulties and death wishes. I have first hand knowledge of the grief of attempted suicide in the fact 3 family members attempted suicide. I was just 14 years old when the first occurred and 18 when my mom attempted not once but twice. The other attempts were 2 of my sisters. At the age of 49 I was planning my own but I wasn't going to just make an attempt. As a nurse I knew anatomy and it wasn't going to be a big deal. I felt the last resort for help was to let my adult children and husband know what I had in mind and that would save me, or at least make them aware that I was troubled. The result was that they blew me off. They seemed like they were scared not of my potential suicide, but of me, they stayed away. Not what I expected. My now ex spouse had shifted my children's perspective of me at very young ages, as he would ask them at times if it was 'safe' to enter the house as I was grieving over a family members death. Their response angered me to the point I buckled down and put my anger to work. I used a tool I had been using for others for years in my nursing career and it was the save for me. We call it a nursing care plan. We use it for patients to determine nursing problems, to identify our end goal and identify measures to achieve our result."

					Sad/Angry

							About 4 months ago I cheated on my wife.  This goes against everything I thought I stood for.  To say I was stressed, and overwhelmed with work, family, and general life stresses at the time is an understatement, but it happened.  I told her the next day because I was disgusted with myself.  Since then, I've gone to counseling and tried to better myself.  For some reason, she is working through it with me.  I'm certain if it wasn't for our three young kids I would probably end it for her because she deservers better, and so do my kids.  Since then, I have been so sad, and generally angry at myself and everything around me.  I hate what I did, feel bad for my wife, and feel like a fraud of a father and husband.  On top of that, for years now I have been worrying about everything - how will my kid's lives be like, will they be happy and well off, will my wife and I have enough money to retire, etc."

							I'm 15 years old. I know that's rather young but already I feel like I've been through so much. I lost my father on Christmas this past year. He was all I had. I lived with my mom because during the time they were separated , so I only saw him about 2 times within the last two years he was alive because of her, before he unexpectedly passed. I'm in a scholars academy and I do very well in school but lately my grades have been going down with all this stress. Not only am I having to bare the loss of my father when he was only 52, but I now loving with my physically and emotional abusive mother who I feel has undiagnosed  schizophrenia- erotomania. I've done a lot of research. Long story short my mom believes there are cameras in the house and microphones by a celebrity she stalks and ""is in love with"" so she walks around the house talking to herself (while she feels she's talking to him) while in lingerie. She hits me and fights with me terribly if I say something out of line because she thinks the purpose of me saying it is so that it'll cause him not to like her anymore. This has been going on for 13 months and there's so much more to the story but I just can't go in detail. It's horrible. During the time my dad died I had to deal with his death while she was crying that the celebrity hasn't called her yet. I'm so miserable. Having to deal with my deceased dad, insane mom who I love and I hate to see like this, i had a boyfriend of two years who left me and had sex with another girl the same day he went. I was numb. I wasn't even sad, I just went numb. Months later I met this new guy and we dated and he left me just as easily. I'm not trying to sound like the typical broken hearted girl, I don't want to kill myself over the recent break up. But when I had the last boyfriend I almost saw my dad in him. It's difficult to explain. He knew everything that went on with my mom and her craziness too so i feel like i have no one. Hes entirely ignoring me. Blocked me on everything. Just with everything piled together I feel like I can't take it anymore. I wake up in the morning all the time wishing I hadn't, the mornings without a doubt are farby the worst for me. I just lie down for hours thinking of ways to kill myself. During the day I'm better, sometimes I randomly hit a low and it's weird. At night I'm okay but not best. I just sit and cry, I shake, I scream, I'm always thinking of ways to end it and I feel like I'm going to break. I can't describe how I feel when I get my low. It happens randomly but it's so scary. I know what happens, not just what goes on in my mind. I have a fit. I don't know how I feel. I never remember why I was so upset after. All I know is I'm so tired of feeling like this, I'm tired of reaching out for help. I just don't want to be here anymore and I've lost hope in even trying to feel better. Everything ends in pain or death so I feel hopeless

					Hurting so bad
				","

							I feel there is no way to physically or mentally deal with the amount of pain I am in. my boyfriend broke up with me 4 months ago. I had been dealing with an illness and the medications and stress caused me to be cranky and unlike how I had been with him prior. I was also overall just feeling very insecure since I was losing my hair due to the medications/treatments and stopped seeing him. I would feel so so guilty about being selfish and not seeing him at this time, but I felt that if he saw me in that state he wouldn't stay with me..of course that would mean he wasn't worth it anyways but all logic had gone out the door during the time of my illness. I have told him how deeply sorry I am for those months I have cried my heart out but he claims he just can't feel for me anymore. He has made it clear as day that he does not love me or care about me. I lost all my friends while I was with him. And just got completely absorbed by the relationship. He was my everything and I trusted him with every ounce of my heart. He has means of getting out of the house and friends to grab lunch with, while I have no one. Everything I looked forward to while fighting cancer was/had to do with him. I try to go on walks and hang out with my little brother (when I can as he doesn't live with me nor does his mom anyone near him) but I still feel hopeless. I have been praying every single day for strength to overcome this but as each day goes by I feel angry at God for taking my best friend away. I haven't been able to do my homework or study I'm near failing my classes and as much as I try to pick myself up I fail. I feel so angry at myself for being this pathetic. He was my entire happiness. I just want to end my life than continue going through this. Seeing how perfectly normal and happy he is makes me wish I could be just half as strong as him. I have been in a relationship before, I went through a lot with him, but I never loved someone this much or invested so much into someone. I have never felt this horrible and helpless. I am tired of myself for loving someone this much who doesn't love me back

							I grew up in an emotionally abusive household and suffered various traumatic experiences that hindered my social development and especially my self confidence.  My father was a strict disciplinarian and very restrictive.  I was never really allowed to develop as individual until I became an adult and managed to acquire freedom.  Due to this I had minimal interests and had no idea what to do with my life.  I am (and was) intelligent, attractive, and physically fit (at least when I maintained it), but despite this I felt hopeless and despaired constantly because I had no self confidence and viewed myself as worthless (due to basically being told so constantly as a child)."

							There is this girl who is kind of my friend with benefits, she broke up with her boyfriend three months ago and I am done with love. We haven't had sex but we have been really close several times. Yesterday we were in her car and she stopped me because she had sex once there with her ex. I told her it didn't matter because we were just going to touch and stuff but she was convinced something else was going to happen. I tried to prove my point by testing her willpower so I kissed her and after a while she stopped me again. I was happy because I thought I had proven that we were able to stop. I tried to kiss her again and she was trying to avoid it but I kept trying. Then all of a sudden she starts crying. I was shocked, I didn't know what to do. I apologized repeatedly and when she calmed down she was a different person. She told me she felt something broke inside of her but she didn't know what was it. Then She just lied there and began talking about her life being worthless and that she would always stay with me in my heart. When I realized she was talking about suicide, I panicked. I apologized again and I tried to convince her she was a wonderful person and I was the fool. She looked awful like a body without soul, I couldn't help crying and then she reacted a little. I held her and then help her up. I told her to believe me when I said she was wonderful, then I told her that together we were going to be alright . She seemed a little better but only a little. I had to go so I left her. I texted her yesterday and today, she didn't answer. I read she posted something on facebook several hours ago, it was a normal post. I hope she is ok but I don't know for sure. She is usually online at this time but not tonight. I texted her and there was no answer. I am scared. I don't know what I broke and why did it break. I feel so bad. It feels as if I had raped her although that is not true because once she started crying I apologized right away. I need help please.!

							I am done trying, I've given it many years of trying to make things better in my life, not just for me but for my child, but nothing seems to work, I've asked hon if he would be ok with not having me around, and he seemed very exited with the idea. I really think is time to give him the opportunity to maybe have someone better then me in his life. with love to my little angel Johnathan

							I found out my ex it engaged to a girl he was friends with whilst we were together, I never liked her because she isn't a nice person. I lost my virginity to him and fell in love instantly. I spent 2 years planning our future, he told me he knew he'd marry me as soon as he saw me. Then one day a petty argument made him cut me out of his life completely. 4 months later and he is engaged. I found out earlier that the girl is pregnant. I threw up, had a panic attack and almost passed out. I was sobbing this morning contemplating cutting my wrists just because of the engagement, now the pregnancy. 4 months ago he told me I was the love of his life. Now she has everything I want. She has the part of him he told me was mine for the rest of my life. I feel dead anyway. I don't want to live my life without him and I don't want to exist anymore. This pain feels engrained into my skin. I ache. I'm going to cut my throat tonight. Then it will all end. I won't exist. I won't have to feel the pain and sickness of knowing my soulmate has chosen someone else. That I'm so worthless.

							Hi, "

							I don't see how life will ever get better. I moved to a new place, where I can't meet new people, I don't have the tools to meet new people (never have and probably never will date), and I have a job where my boss hates my guts. It seems no matter how hard I try or work, he will always be critical. He seems to brush off my hard work and things I've advanced that no one has been doing, and treat me like s*** otherwise and REALLY focus on the negatives to the point where I dread work. Its one thing to point it out, but its like he's using it as a placeover for this ***** overtime hours and ***** pay. He makes mistakes at work, and becomes my problem, and I end up working til 9 because of it (whether obsessing over something trivial for hours or saving something in the wrong place). Worse is I can't call him on it, so I end up blaming myself when that's not the case. Like he keeps purposely falling off a cliff, and I keep catching him...then blaming me for falling off the cliff in the first place. I want to like my work, but my boss makes me dread every single second of life. When (and its pretty much a certainty with his attitude) he does fire me, where will I go? I spent a whole year after graduating college to find a job...and the best I could do was a job with a very low salary in someone's house. I've only worked here for a few months, so I can't put it on a resume. It would be 1.5 years out of employment. I've only started to have the ability to save funds. Now what will I do? I don't have anymore friends or support group or people to rant about my life. Its just me...24/7. And  I'm starting to hate myself: my hair, the sound of my voice, my life, and my predicament in the future."

							A couple of months ago, I was dead set on that I wanted to commit suicide. I was a mess. An emotional blob that couldn't handle anything anymore. I have started to get better, am doing well, I am looking forward to this life I could have, but I still don't feel far from that longing to want to attempt suicide again. I feel tempted to do things, stupid things, overdoses, running away, disappearing from where I am. I can see the life I want, but I also see this longing to want to end my life. Would it really be that wrong to die? I know its not right, but its a means to an end. I went onto a psychiatric ward last month, since coming out, my support has reduced significantly. I now have no one I can talk to properly, I was not referred to anyone on discharge from hospital, I've been left to go it alone. I still don't see that everything can get better. I don't see that things can change.  I see what I want, but I see hurdles that I can't get over. And no support. Maybe I should just give in? Maybe I should just accept I will never get better? I don't know. Confused and more lonely than I've ever felt

							Hello there, I am posting this because I have come to a standstill in life. I have no motivation or ambition to do anything in life, I am lazy to the point where I skip meals until I feel like fainting because I don't want to make my own food or even walk to a Mcdonalds. I feel as if all my friends just left me, Even though I keep contact with a few online or through texts. Its just not the same anymore all I can do is have self pity and say ""I feel alone"". I recently quit my jobs I've been working so hard at because... I just don't feel like working anymore. I am currently living off of a fast depleting bank account with a good 40k in there. I just don't see the point anymore why should I continue to live? I stood off the roof level of a shopping mall and looked down and to me... The pavement so far below never looked so soft before. Why I restrained myself from falling? I'll never know... or maybe I do. Maybe I'm scared of death because once you die that's it right? I'm not a very religious man and I'm not too close with my family either, I don't believe in life after death though when I think about it, It sounds nice. I don't feel the need to do anything special or go anywhere new. I'm not one of those people who just needs to do something with their life because I'm not that kind of person. (no skydiving or some bucket-list events for me) I was just wondering what it feels like to really ""Love yourself"". I don't really understand the circumstances but I think that I am just a confused individual who's lost his way. Countless times I've wished to end it and therapy back in my teens didn't help so why would it now? My so called friends say they're always there for me but I have'nt seen them in two years and three months... (yes I kept track of time. Pathetic aren't I?) and the past few months have been just non-stop online gaming living off of my savings that was supposed to be for a long lived future but really what do I have to accomplish? I don't need a sense of feeling where ""as long as I've done something good in my life I can die happy"" No I don't need that. And I'm sure that any who reads this will probably think that I am just a nut-job or a person who's just mentally ill but I'd just like everything to end. I'm at my limit from running away from things and the only option left to me that I see is the ""Final escape plan"" Its really hard to make new friends I think I've forgotten how to interact with people in person a while back since I started not showing up to school a while back in my high school years. I've stood off the roof parking lot from my own hospital once and I tried to jump but still couldn't. I tried to swallow a bunch of pills but ended up throwing them up out of fear. I'm such a wuss, a failure, a loser. I know that many people have it worse than me too but I tend to think that different people have different tolerance of certain things. I just want to know what anyone reading this would do if they were in my shoes so I could get maybe a change of perspective?

I took an overdose and I didn't succeed. My mum was ill herself and her partner was horrible to me. He'd call me fat and then try and touch me...It wasn't very pleasant. For 7 years I watched my mum get repeatedly beaten up. I've been sexually abused by both a male and a female. I've starved myself. Tried to hang myself. And just yesterday I took another overdose. However, I stopped halfway through. Only taking 16 cocodamol and 4 paracetamol. I violently threw up and fell asleep on the stairs   I had a blood test and I was fine (which was obvious) What I have noticed that I think is a bit odd is that whenever I have to get up to go to work I want to hurt myself in some sort of way so that I don't have to go..."

							My name is Kate and this time last year my depression truly began to take hold of my life. I wanted to die and I truly did not believe that I would be alive today. I'm writing this post as a year later I feel proud to be where I am now and I want to share my story with anyone thinking that suicide is the best way out. I also want to offer some advice. I'm not the best advice giver and I know that some of you may not gain any help from this post but I hope I can change at least one persons view in suicide.  "
"
					Is life worth it?
				","

							Hello everyone. I'm only 19 years of age, but I would say that I've been depressed for years now. You see, I've always wanted someone in my life who I can love and have them love me back. I'm not referring to family, but a significant other. I was indeed home-schooled throughout high school, and didn't have any interaction with my peers during those years. Perhaps due to this solitude I developed the idea that I'm an undesirable person."
"
					I may be delusional or ""crazy""
				","

							So I have been dating a guy that claimed to really like me. I really liked him. It was too good to be true though. I sensed he was lying and went to his house like a stalker. I knocked on the door. His father told me he was with a girl. "
"
					Death Seems Like an Easier Option
				","

							I've heard the mantra - ""suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem."" I know to a certain extent, this is the truth. However, it has little effect on me. I've simply lost the desire to live. I just don't have the will to go on. Waking up every morning is such an intolerable grind. Sleep is when I'm at peace. But I know that deep down, every human being has self-preservation instincts, and I'm certain it's that aspect of survival that's stopped me from loading my grandfather's old pistol and putting it to my head. The way I feel now is a culmination of several events in the last four years that have worn me down. "
,"

							My name is Mark.  I've got no more fight left inside of me.  Life has chewed me up and spit me out.  I'm now dwelling some place below hell and realize suicide for me is a mercy killing.  I'm so frightened to have to do this but there are no medals or trophy's for walking this earth daily dealing with complete misery."
"
					Want to talk.
				","

							I don't know if I am in the right place.  But I have been feeling like there is no tomorrow for me.  Not litterally, but I dont think that i can continue my life the way it's going.  I am 20 years old, living at home with mom and brother and sisters.  I feel like i have irreparably ****ed up my life.  I am thousands of dollars in debt, and only have a GED, so getting a job, going to school, or saving money to do what i really want to do seems damn near impossible.  I am always unhappy, except when i lived out with my cousin on the west coast.  I moved away from home about a year ago, but had to move back due to an ongoing heroin addiction.  I have never ACTUALLY considered suicide, thought about it many of times, but this is the first time i have actually thought it through.  I dont know, im sure that i wont do it, i guess i am just looking for a little support as i cannot talk to my parents about this and i have no real friends.  Thanks everyone.

							The love of my life left me 5 months ago after 2.5 years.I've been completely lost and broken without her. She was the most beautiful girl I've been with insider and out. She fell in love with me fast and her love for me opened my heart again and I fell head over heals for her. She made me a better man. She was 23 and I'm 30, SHE was the first to bring up moving in even getting married. As I fell deeper in love I too wanted all that she wanted for us."

					Concerned about my friend
				","

							Just before the new year I was speaking to my friend of over three years. They are in their 30's. They told me that this will be their final year, that they will getting their affairs in order and that they are tired of all the years of pain and suffering that they have gone through. My friend suffers with anxiety and depression. It has been debilitating for them. They have tried numerous medications but almost nothing has helped. My friend has told me in the past that they have not been suicidal since high school. I do not think that these things that they said recently were anything in passing. I take things like this quite seriously. We were supposed to chat on the phone but they told me that they were just not feeling up to it. This is common for this person. I have tried to probe further and asked if they meant what they said or if they were just having a rough day. They were quiet in their response. They said that they will tell me details later. Whatever that means. If they never meant it, they could have told me that they were just having a bad day. It seems like they won't open up to me and don't want to talk about it. Trust me I have not forgotten about it since. "

					i need help  , suicide is following me everywhere
				","

							I really need help,  I'm considering killing myself tonight,  these suicidal thoughts come and go but they always come back.  Idk why I'm feeling this.  Let me tell you bout my life.  I live in Cali long Beach . When I was in 2nd or 3rd grade I was touched by an 19 year old.  He was my cousins best friend and he would do it more than once and those thoughts would haunt me inside.  I hate him for that . Since I was a little kid Idk what to do.  I didn't know ifit was a good thing or bad.  But now I do , and those thoughts of him touching me keep coming back.  Well now he pays for my phone bill.  But this might be why I am thinking if suicide Idk why.  He touched me more than once "" I didn't know where to go or who to tell.  He told m to not tell anyone or else.  I kept it all to myself.  Should I **** him up? Should I move on and let it go?  What?  I need help.  Also my ex broke up with me last year and that didn't help at all.  I wanna die so badly.  I'm going to do it I just need a place to.  Someone help me ;;(( . I have nobody to go to or to tell.  I'm done with life.  Its my time to go ' im over life.  I just need someone.  Someone anyone.  Please.  Also my uncle beat the **** out of me last year and socked ne in my head alot and almost knocked me out "" I am only 15. These thoughts run through my head all day everyday.  I need some nyquil and drink that whole thing.  Hopefully it will putbme to sleep.  So i can never wake up Also I can't sleep or eat.  I NEED HELP.  No one understands how I feel right now.  I can't open up to anyone.  Its too embarrassing and I can't do it.  I haven't told anyone about this.  Just please help me.  I'm ****ing up in school ' no one likes me.  I want to go.  I'm tired of all this pain.  My brother beats ne up constantly.  I have no where to turn to.  Nobody to go or talk to.  I can't stop crying.  I'm a 15 year old boy.  Idk if this is normal or not but I need help.  Its killing me inside.  I can't take it anymore. I tried cutting my wrists in 8th grade.  Didn't help.  Now I'm on to pills or downing some cough medicine.  I need help ASAP.  Nobody understads me.  The person that touched my private still is asking ne to and he tries to but everytime he tries I sock the **** outta his face.  All this is just not helping.  Both my aunts died by cars and I feel the need to be with both of.them right now.  Why isn't God taking ne.  He has taken everyone else.  why not me.  I deserve to go.  I need to go.  I'm done.  I wanna die

							This week at home, with my family and friends, was ruined by my horrible job evaluation. My mom (a human resources manager) and two friends in human resources all said that my bosses handled my evaluation horribly but it was all I could think about. The failure half of this year has been. Family members asked how it was down here and I couldn't fake happiness, I told them it was horrible.

					Repressed memory making me suicidal
				","

							This may sound feeble to some but its dominating my thoughts. I am 21 and have lived a life to be grateful for, good friends, good marks at school, good jobs and a healthy sex life. However a memory that i never really forgot about has been playing on my mind for the last few months, and its driving me insane. When i was 7 i had a male friend (also 7) that i use to play with. I still see him time to time now and get on well with him but this is rare as we drifted apart from about the age of 10. I dont remember well but i re call an incident with both of us being interested in our private parts. I dont know how it come about but i remember us both kissing each others privates. I have nothing against gay people, but i feel disturbed because i know for a fact i have never had a gay thought or experience in my life. Im also sure hes not either, since he has had a girlfriend of 5 years now. From what i remember i didn't enjoy what we did, and it seems a very uncharacteristic for me to do even at the age of 7. I've managed to repress this memory for 15 years now, but for some reason in the last few months it has got to me. I feel dirty, and to an extent i feel like i lost my innocence that day. Im sure he has forgot and doubt that even if he does remember he has any intentions of telling anyone. But i feel if it was to come out, it would follow me for the rest of my life. The only person i have told is my mum, and she has told me that i was to young to know what sexuality was at that age (Which i know is true, because i remember it not being a sexual thing) and that although what i did was wrong, plenty of kids that age have probably done the same. She also claims that the boy involved was always quite a strange child, and that she thinks he probably instigated it. If i re call rightly, it was his idea but i still feel dirty for taking part. I also read somewhere that this happens when a child has been exposed to sexual abuse. I know i have never been, but cant say that he hasn't. And the fact it was his idea, suggests maybe there's a chance he has been, which makes me feel even worse about it. Im probably wrong, and it was more then likely a simple case of just two curious young boys not knowing what they were doing. I know it may seem stupid to some, but this is really getting to me and i feel like i have done something terrible, im finding it hard to cope at the moment and have been having suicidal thoughts . Is there anyone who can provide with some support about this? Please

				","

							I work at a hospital for mental illness.  two days ago i came to work and there was a patient missing, meaning our camera person was not able to locate her on any of the camera's we have set up to monitor our patients.  I began to search for the girl, starting with her room, no luck.  I began to move down the hall looking everywhere i could.  I got to the women's bathroom, i knocked first and announced my presence before going in.  when i came to the shower part of the bathroom she was there, hanging from the a vent in the ceiling tile.  I sent the women i was with to alert the others and quickly jumped to the edge of the bathtub, braced myself with one leg on the chair she had used and with my left arm grabbed hold of her lifting her as i used my right arm to rip the vent out of the roof.  i lowered her to the floor and began cpr.  I am just a cna at this hospital, by that time the doctors and rn's had arrived to take over cpr so i vacated the small room so that they would have the space they needed.  by the time the ambulance had arrived they had a pulse, but she was not breathing on her own.  basically i need to get some things off my chest, i cant get the picture of her hanging there, her face, the coldness of her body, all these things that i cant get out of my mind.  i haven't been having nightmares or anything like that but when im awake i constantly see it.  Just wanted to share my story with you all.  thank you for reading."

							I haven't killed myself yet and probably will never surrender to commit, but what am I living for? Nothing, absolutely nothing. My therapist can't help me although I think she empathizes my situation a lot. I attempted my first suicide when I was 8 because I saw what was coming as my future, and so far I'm almost right on the dot and wish I didn't become so angry at the world that I refuse to just give in and end my life and prefer to avenge and destroy the world along with me instead. I just have bad luck my whole life, and I'm not talking about losing in a game or have parents died when young. I'm talking about everything I tried so hard to get back up and start over and over and keeps getting knocked down again and again and again my whole 40 something years."

							I have a very good life, I guess you can say I've been blessed, not to say my life was perfect but I would say the good times outweighed the bad. However, for as long as I can remember... I've never wanted to LIVE. It was always a tough task to stay alive, and if it was possible, I would love to trade my life for someone else's. Someone who doesn't have the same chance at life that I do. Which in result, made me feel extremely guilty. Whenever I'd watch sad stories of those who weren't able to live full lives(due to circumstances out of their control), I felt it was very unfair. I would be in tears, that such unfortunate events would befall them, that they weren't able to live longer then they weren't meant to and weren't ready to go. It felt so unfair, why couldn't someone like me, who has a whole life ahead of them, is not allowed give my life away to someone who deserves it? I can't completely describe it these feelings. This is not a cry out for help in any way. I'm an organ donor, so if anything were to happen to me, I have a peace of mind that I am able to save lives of those who deserve and want that chance at life. I have thought about ending my life many many times, but as many of you know, it is not very easy. I feel guilty, I'm a waste of oxygen yet I'm not able to give my life away to those who have a will to live but are not able to."

					Boyfriend says he ""feels nothing""

							So a couple of days ago my boyfriend of 8 months told me he is suicidal.  He said he had a good childhood.  He has a good job, his own apt, quality friends, and yours truly.  We have a good relationship, it's not verbally or physically abusive or anything like that.  So he literally told me he's not depressed and nothing's wrong in his life, he just feels ""empty"" and has no feelings good or bad.  And because of this, he has been contemplating suicide.  Any thoughts on this?  I really don't know what to say to him about this, but I know from past experience that when someone tells you this you shouldn't brush it off like they're looking for attention, even if they are.  What are your thoughts?

					How do you all do it?

							I don't know how people do it. How do people get through the day when everything is stacked against them? How do you just not give up to stop the pain of waking up each day to problem after problem? This past week has been the absolutely hardest. I found out the guy I thought I was dating wasn't actually dating me (he said he wasn't looking for a boyfriend right now). I spent a week at work where nothing was working in my favor, I was talked about as ""having some issues"" and I was treated like I don't have two degrees but just graduated kindergarten. My car had another problem with it and after speaking to my mom about being able to finance it, I literally collapsed to the floor to cry and couldn't find the strength to get up for 20 minutes. The only time this week that I was happy was going out with that guy again and spending the night. I know I'm setting myself up for hurt with him but he is the only thing down here that makes me happy. I've come so close to ending it this week... how do you get through it all just under the assumption that everything will be alright when you turn around and another thing has gone wrong???

					Leave a note or just disappear?
				","

							Let me start by saying this isn't a ""cry for help"", attention play, or open forum for pity. I have spent years bearing the weight of knowing how broken I am and contemplating the solution and its ripples from all angles. This decision was not reached in haste or rage and as such was reached with resolve, however I am at a crossroads as to whether I should leave some sort of note for whoever happens to walk in to this room after I walk out. Considering I no longer really feel emotions and am unable to translate or communicate that emptiness effectively, and I really have nothing to say, the note seems pointless. Or, should I simply clean everything, donate my belongings to charity, and disappear with dignity. Thoughts?


"
"
					Another way out?
				","

							So... I've posted on this website a few days ago, trying to get out what has been bothering me. While at the same time avoid giving out in depth personal details, yes I tend to do that. And in this I hinted around suicide. Which I believe went unnoticed, big surprise there. Anyhow. Basically I just get told to ""Get over it."" Which would be fine and dandy if it worked. So I'm just going to cut to chase, I've been thinking of killing myself for a long time. About 11 or 12 years. Of course, at first it was just curiosity, wondering what it would be like. But still considering, because really, how else should you feel as an 8 or 9 year old being told your a worthless little sh**, smacked around, neglected and all that fun stuff. Such as sitting in a room full of adults purposeful ramming your head into a wooden desk, busting yourself open, and somehow you still go unnoticed. Anyway, as I'm now 20, going to be 21 in December. And I feel pretty much exactly the same, the thought of putting a gun in my mouth and blowing my brains out makes me happier than thinking of what tomorrow will bring. People tell me I need to find God, which is a load of crap. I've been crying out to God my entire life. And what have I got to show for it? A bunch of baggage from my child hood and teenage years, no friends, never had a girlfriend, my father was an abusive drug addict who is now dead, my older sister doesn't give an ounce of crap about anyone in our family, my little sister straight up hates us, and the only person on the planet that I care about is being slowly, and painfully taken away before my eyes. I know my mother won't last much longer with all the heart and lung issues she has. But in my experience, God doesn't care, or he simply doesn't exist. So everyday I fantasize about buying a shotgun, finding a nice little secluded spot, and pulling the trigger. See? I've planned this out. You don't need a license to buy a shotgun, ammo is relatively cheap, and nobody is going to stop me. Pretty sad this is what I plan for while people tell I'm doing the right thing in life. Getting a job, living on my own. I even thought about college, what a joke. Anyway, I've blabbed on enough. Oh, and save the selfish speech, I really couldn't care less. Because when I think about that last moment and everything going black, and the never ending nothingness that follows, nothing else matters. At least I hope.

I am alone, even when around the people at work. Financially I can't get out of here, can't leave the area, can't interview anywhere else, can't be where my friends are. There's little to save from my paycheck to move, to interview, to get out of where I am. I'm just not happy. "

					Would it really be selfish for me to kill myself?
				","

							Ok, so my mother who is now in her mid 50s recently lost her mother a few months ago.  With that being said, I have seriously considered killing myself in the past.  While I am not suicidal at the moment, there are times when I get extremely down because I am such a freak.  Now, I realize that some of you guys on here will try to consule me about my situation, but that simply does not change my circumstances.  Guys, I am a 31 year old man who has never had a gf, is still a freaking involuntary virgin for crying out lout, and am still working on my undergraduate because of my foolish decision to join the U.S. Marine Corps when I was 18.  Anyway, I am just curious as to whether or not it would really be selfish for me to kill myself due to the fact that I am a 31 year old male virgin who has never had a gf before.  Guys, I realize that it is very easy for you to sit there and say that I am the problem and that it is NOT the city in which I live is the problem.  If that is the case, then why does the Colorado Springs Craigslist rants and raves board always have complaints from guys about women and the dating scene where I currently live?  On that note, I realize that I will eventually graduate from college and will move to a new city, but that will still not change the fact that women will not find it acceptable that I am a 31 year old virgin who's never had a gf even though they will, in all likelihood, be much more down to Earth versus the women in the city in which I currently reside.  I'm serious guys, I would rather kill myself than to live to reach my 70s and die alone.  It is REALLY looking as if it is my fate to die as an old man who was rejected by women until his death.  That fate is simply unacceptable to me guys.  Again, in light of what I just told you, would it REALLY be selfish for me to off myself in terms of leaving behind a mother and sister who care about me?

							My mom has been negligent of me ever since I was I baby. She basically locked me in my room when she couldn't deal with my pain... and she had therapists raise me rather than doing it herself and bonding with me. I've been betrayed, sexually assaulted (and the guy STILL has girls who adore him, including my former best friend, who knows what he did to me). As a result I have trouble making friends and trusting people. I posted a reply to someone with the whole story so if you want to see the whole thing to the thread by Lulzsec and go to the fourth page."
"
					What is the right thing to do?
				","

							To start off, I want to state that I've lived in an immensely privileged life. I grew up with a loving family and my life doesn't explain why I feel the way I do now. I'm 18 years old, attending college at a prestigious university and I have failed. I will not be able to return to the university the following semester. My girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me 2 months ago and I still cannot get over her while she simply moved on. I feel like my life is in shambles, like I've disappointed everyone who was proud of me. Like even I can't make myself happy,thus I have been thinking of suicide, not because its the easy way out or because I want attention, but rather because I question if I deserve to live. There are much stronger people in the world, who have put up with more and thrived in more. Do I deserve to continue to exist if I cannot deal with the easy problems of a privileged life? Maybe it's better for society and the gene pool of humanity if I just disappear.  There are very few people who care about me, those who do all being family members. I'm not naive enough to think that my death would not cause more problems for the small amount of people who know me and the smaller amount who care. However, I think about the financial troubles my death would ease and it makes suicide seem like a better option. Yes, I have two smaller brothers and my death would affect them immensely, but I spent my time with them teaching them to accept change in their lives and to always strive on with inner strength, because I don't want them to be like me, without the will or strength to get through every day. Now I get back to the question of how to handle my situation. Once my family sees my failure in college, they will never accept me again, and I begin thinking of suicide rather than living a life where the few people who care about me begin to resent me. Is it alright to think about suicide every day? Is it okay? Should I just end my life? I've established that I don't have the will or strength to continue and not only would everybody who cares about me be fine, but be better off? To clarify, I'm not thinking about suicide because ""everyone would be better off without me""(be that as it may) but because I don't have the will to continue; I admit it, I am acting selfishly and cowardly,but I am being honest to myself for once that I am not strong enough nor worth enough to continue, and that's what scares me. Thus it begs the question what is the right thing to do?

					Why?
				","

							I was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder when I was 12, now I'm 21,  so I'm used to telling myself that I'm probably jjust depressed and that I shouldn't make any rash decisions while feeling this way. But this is different. I feel almost blank. I have considered suicide on a near-daily basis for the past eleven years, but I've always found a way to hold on. Whether it was fear of death, or waiting til I tried something that I wanted to do, I've always held on, obviously. But I don't feel connected to anything anymore, I don't see this step I'm about to take as anything significant. I 'know' that this will hurt my family, but somehow I feel as if I don't 'know'. As if I've lost the capacity to feel. "

					Waste of life
				","

							I think I've truly hit rock bottom... Not financially... But in life. Or I've already hit my peak, and its time to check out. There aren't to many days I don't spend alone... Drowning myself with alcohol... I don't have one friend left, infact I pushed pretty much every friend I've ever had away from me about 2 years ago. As for family... I was always kind of a black sheep... I may talk to someone in my family maybe 1-2 times per month for 3 minutes on the phone. There isn't a day that goes by I don't feel like a useless waste of f***ing skin... And really I have felt depressed for the last 3 years. I find it hard to smile... There's just no reason to smile anymore, or anyone to share it with... Did I mention I've also become severely antisocial over the years. I can't stop and talk to someone for two minutes, soon as I get in a conversation I'm looking for a way out. My mind goes completely blank... And I start having anxiety attacks.

					Very scared
				","

							I was with a woman for over 2 years, living together for about 2. I did everything in the world for this woman, and loved her with every bit of my heart. I never was abusive, and I never cheated on her, and I had done things that  for here that I have never done for anybody else. only to find out she had been cheating on me, and she left me on Christmas Eve for the guy she had been cheating with. I was so distraught that I didnt even spend the holidays with my family. I had never felt so used, so small, or had such a feeling of emptiness. I am a very private person, and very rarely let my feelings be known, and I always thought of myself as being very strong emotionally, but I just couldnt hide all of this. People had never seen this side of me before, and I had never felt so weak. I tried to stay strong, and drug myself into work everyday, and then forced myself to go out on my nights off, and even started reading the breakup forums here, but nothing i did seemed to help. I began having anxiety/panic attacks again (which I havent had in years), and began to drink myself stupid. I tried different antidepressants, but they only seemed to make things worse. My job reminded me of her (I got the job while we were together), and I just couldn't take it anymore and quit, then I started drinking full time. I have never in my life felt such anger towards somebody, and I was really very scared that I was gonna hurt both him and her. I finally got to where i felt like I could control my feelings when I was around other people, and I hid everything for about 2 months. Just this past week every feeling I had been feeling since the breakup have come back x10. "

					A sick life, a saved life, a useless life
				","

							I found out two years ago that I was very sick with something that the doctors in my country don't recognize as an illness because it is gender specific and there is no research regarding gender specific illnesses here.  I have always been taken advantage of by doctors and by family and friends, mostly because I was always ""out of it"".  I have never been able to find the man of my dreams, have the friends I wanted to have, have the education I wanted or the family life.  I have always been treated very badly at home by my mother who is mentally ill but mostly doesn't care about anyone but herself and is an oscar winning actress.  She has managed to single handedly ruin my life and has gathered other family members to promote hatred to me.  My former illness is brought on by stress, like all other illnesses.  THe problem is that I was always told that there is absolutely nothing wrong with me, I am very healthy, or I am very sick and was taken advantage of.  The illness affected my memory, my motivation, my life in every way.  I had no idea that I was so sick.  In this country they just remove organs and dispose of them without fixing the problem and it only makes people more sick.  I have had so much trouble with work, no employer wanted to hire me because my skin was so pale that my lips were blue.  I was so sick and when my dad passed my mom swindled all of my money from me.  I had nothing left.  I had to live with her, but that's the reason that she did it, she could care less about getting help for her own problems and always said that I was the one that was sick in the head, she just aims to hurt me and takes pleasure in my pain.  She makes a point out of causing me so much grief that I shake from the stress and she just smiles and laughs, and punches herself in the breast then tells everyone that I am the one hurting her.  Everyone I've ever known has told me to get away from her and out of her clutches, but I have given her all of my money and still continue to live with her 10 years later.  She made it so that she owns everything and "

					Is this a good reason to commit suicide?
				","

							Should someone such as myself who is 30 years old, is a loser virgin, and who has NEVER had a girlfriend consider committing suicide?  Let's face it, NO WOMAN is going to want some loser such as myself who is a 30 year old virgin.  With that being said, I would like to say that I HAVE NOT remained a virgin by choice, but have lived in military towns my entire life which don't have much ""selection"" in terms of available single women.  I feel like a complete FREAK at this point in my life.  After I got out of the military, I had a manufacturing job and was subsequently laid off.  I then began my undergraduate education and am now only a couple of semesters away from graduating.  I've tried everything guys.  I've tried online dating in Colorado Springs and have also tried talking to women on my college campus and none of them want anything to do with me as they ALWAYS tell me about their boyfriend when I try to talk to them.  Anyway, I'm not going to kill myself anytime in the immediate future, but it is something that I have nonetheless contemplated as I am a complete failure when it comes to women.  One last thing, it REALLY bothers me that I didn't get to lose my virginity to another virgin while in high school like alot of guys get to do.  If I do ever have sex with someone then it will certainly be to a non-virgin which makes me hate myself even more.

A cheating/lying wife is no reason to want to die by any stretch but I seem to have had a dark cloud over my life and situations like these seems to have taken a toll on me. I get to a point where I can do nothing but stare off into space wondering what I did wrong to deserve the bull**** I am forced to endure every day. It also doesn't help that the one person who I can talk to any time I need a ""friend"" is the person who broke my heart. Other people in my life couldn't care less about what I'm feeling or have to say (which is why I'm posting here... I've got no one else to turn to). In the passed two weeks, I've learned that my wife has been lying and cheating since before we got married, my art has been rejected from two different art galleries with no explanation why and I'm so stressed that my daughter's usually funny toddler antics have caused me to have break downs because my stress is so high and my patience is so short.

I literally will zone out for most of the day and pretend i'm someone else, someone successful and well liked, and its like i'm living out their life in my head....it helps me to escape the feeling of emptiness I have.  but eventually the fantasy has to end and then I just hit rock bottom and can't stop crying because i have nothing in my life.

							nothing entertains me anymore. i was diagnosed with depression and put on prozac about a year ago and things got better--not great--but better... but now i just feel so bored with everything. i don't want to do anything and because of this i am having suicidal thoughts--not because i feel sad, but because the mundane processes of life have left me with nothing interesting to do. might seem silly, but i just needed to tell someone because i'm going insane.

,"

							Well, this whole thing has just turned into a big mess.  My fiance/ live in bf of seven years did something really terrible to me, if you read my other posts you will understand. I have kicked him out of the house and told him that I am seriously considering breaking up with him.  Actually, I have told him that I'm leaving him, but ultimately I decided that a break apart would be best for me to gather my thoughts and decide what my next step will be. Anyways, at first I thought I was suicidal and maybe I still am a bit, but I am most concerned about him because of things that he has said.  He all of the sudden wants to take out a huge life insurance policy on himself and has been thinking of ways to kill himself to make it seem accidental.  His voice sounds very lifeless on the phone, not depressed or sad, but literally lifeless.  I have never heard him sound or talk this way in the 8 years I have known him. I realize this all sounds pretty crazy and we are both highly emotional people in general, but ecspecially right now.  What can I do to help him aside from giving him false hopes about our relationship?  I have tried talking to him and he has a really terrible, unsupportive family that uses him every chance they get.  How can I convince him that this is not the answer?

							I've ruined the greatest thing that ever happened to me. My wife left me two weeks ago after five years together. I had an emotional affair three years ago and lost my wife's trust. I don't even know if it was an emotional affair, I was talking to her because she showed me attention. My wife tried to get over it but she couldn't and so she left me. She said she was tired of living in fear and of not feeling good enough. I can't believe I betrayed her like that and ruined us. We built a life together, I wanted to have babies with her. She is so much better than me, I wonder where I went wrong. How things could have been different."

I only mention it because MOST people who do call those lines or who post on here aren't 100% committed to doing it, which is a very good thing. The fact that they still reach out means that they want someone to back them off the ledge, even if they don't want to admit it. Even those people who sound ""excited"" about the prospect of ending their life have enough doubt that they need to post on a forum to have it validated or refuted by others..."

							I hate to add to what is already here but I am glad I found this site not knowing what I will hear back but I really need it. I'm 22 I wanna die and I don't have the guts to jump. I have tried starting a car in the garage and sitting in there with my good bye note. I have tried pills... but yet i'm still here. I have been so hurt by my past it has left me in a zoned out like daze. I use to have what everyone wants growing up friends,girlfriends,etc ... but from a one time cocaine incident my eye has nerve issues but isn't terribly bad but just enough to know it's different. It can't open quite like the other but almost, looks glossy at times and when I smoke weed or drink you can tell even more(but you can tell when i'm sober too) I have gone to many doctors and such and they haven't come up with anything. Then I found this place that claims they knew how it could heal from a machine they had(electric acuscope) to repair the damaged nerves.I feel like I don't have a problem with my eye it's just the nerves and muscles around it. I went a few times didn't see anything change I didn't have the money to keep going back there though. Other doctors online say I should see a Orthadonist when they heard my story but I feel like I have no soul and the damage that was done can't be fixed no matter what. I wanna work but ever since the accident I try to avoid people because they can see it too and find me really ackward and i'm not use to this because I use to be the kinda person who liked meeting new people and now I don't have that in me anymore well atleast on the outside. I hate having this problem that I can't solve no matter where I turn.. I hate that i'm in my prime I have ragin hormones and can't even talk with girls. I had it bad though before my eye went bad sorta because my best friend found a new friend instead of me and he broke my window and crapped on my steps and got everyone in the city to hate me. And acouple girls I really loved(I accepted that we werent gonna be a couple) wouldn't even be there as a friend for me anymore so it's just getting worse to me and I feel like the path is continuing to get worse. I'm smart and want the best in life but when nothing at all goes right I have no other option but to try to end it. "

							My back story with my ex and I is long and complicated but things have been looking a little better.  On a side not, for this story to make sense, I am a Soldier in Afghanistan.  So technically relationships are greatly frowned down upon but NOT illegal.  You are just not allowed in the room of someone of the opposite sex.  Which makes life in Afghanistan for a girl extraordinarily difficult.  I met my boyfriend in Afghanstian but he was a contractor, not a Soldier.  We clicked.  He is one of the most amazing people I have ever met and just hanging out with him and being around him makes me happy.  My team is horrible and they are rude and mean and being around him helps me find some sense of normalcy.  "

							For a while I've felt suicidal but I've read helpful books, tv shows and movies that helped to dissipate those feelings. At one point I felt like I wasn't suicidal anymore and I found a new appreciation for life but it came back again. I started reading all the books in the library on suicide, going over every bit of advice that could help me. I felt like the advice was helpful and I started to feel a bit stronger but I still have thoughts of suicide. I don't have money for therapy, which is something else I've considered. It's something I think I really need actually. So I was sitting here looking at the phone trying to dial the suicide hotline so maybe they could help. I kept dialing the number over and over but not sending it. I started getting frustrated with myself because I couldn't bring myself to do it. I know I need help but one of the problems I have is with anxiety and I started thinking too much. I tried to look up people who have used a suicide hotline but I couldn't really find a lot. I wonder how you find it in you to do it.

					I'm scared and need advise
				","

							I have never posted anything like this before so please excuse me if I am unclear. I am 27 and have suffered bouts of depression since I was 12, some mild some more severe, one 2 years ago when I attempted suicide...the usual cry for help kind of attempt but I did felt out of control and completely removed from myself and the world around me.In recent months I have been getting the same feeling I had two years ago- Nervous talking to people (colleagues and friends) anxious at the thought of talking to someone or socialising, I get overwhelmed by tasks as small as making dinner, I make plans and cancel at the last minute, I am becoming more and more emotionally dependant on my partner which leaves me feeling worse when I think about how I can't seem to get through the day with out seeking reassurance from him. When I am not feeling low I am smart and fun to be around but I feel that is slipping away more and more. The people that knew me as fun to be around now know that I have this other side and that leaves me so insecure even when I am in good form and chatting away to someone I think to myself 'well they are know I'm a depressed waste of a person so what's the point in pursuing happiness'. As write this I realise how silly that is but it is what goes through my mind. I work in the 'art world', I studied a degree in art practice but I still feel so inadequate around other artists and curators, I want to be as knowledgeable as them and I get focused and start reading the texts (mostly philosophy) but I think I'm reading for the wrong reasons, it is like I am trying to become better by knowing more which is fair enough I guess but in the process of reading I panic that I have so far to go in order to be good at what I do so I stop and draw the same conclusion each time 'I am not smart enough,I should just give up now because it is making me feel like s**t'. I look around me and the people that seem happy are the ones that don't ask so many questions and accept what they are capable of and work within those limits.I analyse everything, each conversation I walk away from I play it back in my head and pick out the parts that I sounded stupid. I judge other people too, if they say one tiny thing that could sound ignorant, racist, prejudice or backward I label them as the thing they said. I then feel guilty and recognise how unfair that is and conclude that not only am I an idiot, I am unkind too. This goes on and on every day, I am feel so sad because I know under it all that I am kind and smart but I just can't seem to get past all these negative thoughts. I feel exhausted and just want to quit my job, break up with my boyfriend, cut ties with my family and kill myself. I am scared that I could actually do these things unless I get help.

							I heard today through my little sis that my bro was saying he felt ""suicidal"". Just feel really sick to the stomach, worried, upset that he feels this way. I know how it feels and it's the worst feeling, the depths of darkness it's so frightful."
,"

							Ok, so before some of you start posting links and/or telephone numbers to suicide prevention hotlines, let me first state that, at the moment, I am not feeling suicidal and/or having suicidal thoughts.  Moreover, I should note that I have NEVER actually attempted suicide.  However, there have been MANY moments in my messed up life where I have felt like taking my own life.  The ONLY reason that I have not actually attempted suicide is due to the fact that it would devastate my mother and I don't want to put her through any more pain as she had a rough childhood just like I did.  On that note, I have lived a VERY NON-TRADITIONAL adulthood life thus far.  Instead of getting to go to college directly after high school like most normal Americans get to do, I was pretty much talked into joining the United States Marine Corps which put me in a small town which had nothing but MARRIED military wives.  After getting out of the Marines at age 23, I took a job in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  Unbeknownst to me at the time, Colorado Springs, Colorado is another military town with five bases and, as such, there is an extreme lack of single women here.  Anyway, here is why I have felt like taking my own life before.  I am a 30 year old male virgin who has NEVER been in a serious relationship or even had a real girlfriend.  It TRULY hurts me because I didn't get to begin dating at a normal age and lose my virginity at a normal age like most people get to do due to the fact that I had zero self esteem which was attributed to my abusive upbringing.  Even more hurtful is the fact that alot of women feel as if I owe it to any potential future partner in regards to telling them that I am a virgin.  Come on guys, it would be MUCH different if I was a 16 or 18 year old male virgin and had to tell my girlfriend that I was a virgin, but being a 30 year old virgin is quite embarrassing which is putting it mildly.  Since I am 30 years old, a virgin, and have never had a gf before, I have felt like killing myself on several occasions, but like I said before, I wouldn't do that because I don't want to hurt the few people who care about me.  Also, I HAVE talked to a therapist regarding these issues and am currently taking anti-depressants.  With that being said, I DO NOT want to have to live the next 30 to 35 years of my life dealing with rejection from the opposite sex, dealing with sexual frustration, and being alone.  Do YOU want to be on your deathbed KNOWING that you NEVER experienced love and/or never had anyone who found you attractive enough to engage in a long term relationship with you?  I didn't think so.

					Can suicide ever be seen as a justifiable, rational and acceptable choice?
				","

							Throughout my teenage years and up until now I've always contemplated suicide, it used to be a emotional draining and scary train of thought but over the years, the factor of pain, misery and sadness gradually started to fade away. From what I've noticed, it's extremely difficult to discuss the subject of suicide with people as their views are generally set in stone. They are usually always heavily optimistic, pro life and against suicide for reasons which seem to be emotionally fueled with occasionally a touch of fear.  "

							Hello everyone,"

							the only good boyfriend I've ever had just left me, and everyone I've been with before him was abusive and cruel. I don't have any real friends, only people that come by to smoke whenever I have weed. my dad constantly yells at me and tells me how useless I am and acts like I'm some kind of  *  *  *  *  * . I've been cheated on so many times in a past relationship that I now have vd and it's painful and I'm embarrassed just to know it's there. I used to be anorexic but then I started to recover and gained a little bit of weight eating normally, but now I'm around 200 lbs still eating normally and every time I look at myself in the mirror I wish I could just die right there. my hair's always a frizzy mess and looks like  *  *  *  * , and I've never thought of myself as actually being pretty. I used to be able to do a lot of things like singing, playing piano, ballet, tae kwon do,drawing and painting, but one of my abusive relationships put a stop to all that and now when I try to do any of it I just can't. my back, neck, feet, and joints always hurt, and when I don't have a stomachache or a headache, I have intense cramps. I'm constantly in pain. I've been verbally/emotionally/mentally abused and also physically/sexually abused a lot in my life, and every time I try to socialize I get shot down and treated like dirt. no one's ever here for me, all I can bring myself to do lately is lock myself in my room and cry. my family doesn't even love me, they always tell me how much of a failure I am and about how I'll never be able to do anything. no one likes me, and therefore no one loves me. I'm completely alone in a world that doesn't want me. if I were to fill my garage up with carbon monoxide, take a bunch of pills, mix uppers with downers, drown my emotions in hard liquor, get up on a later under a noose, slit my wrists up and down, tighten the nose around my neck, kick he chair, grab a gun and blow my brains out, no one would give a  *  *  *  * . and I'm really tempted to de it. I hear a lot of people always telling suicidals that they'll get through it and their bad feelings will pass, but I've felt this hopelessness ever since my mom died from cancer when I was three. now I get to watch my nana, the only person in the world who cares about me, as she dies a slow horrible death also from cancer. in a way, I feel like I too have cancer, but in my soul rather than in my body. there's this dark feeling that overwhelms me and consumes and kills me everyday. every now in then it feels a little bit better but not enough to be able to enjoy anything. I'm worthless to everyone and I should just off myself. I seriously want to die. it's not like anyone will miss me.

							I have just started getting treated for depression. Talking to a shrink in the first time in years has made me realize just how pathetically debilitated my depression and anxiety I have been. I have done a lot of interesting things in my life, traveled, always been adventurous to find out about the way other live locally and abroad and was even a bit of an activist for awhile. My jumping around to get my broad view of life has left me with a lot of experience and no actual accomplishments. I am 28 so this is starting to seem like a mistake. Worst of all, I never really enjoyed any of it like I should have, I have always been depressed. For some reason telling a doc about my panic attacks, my evening spent curled in a fetal position, my fears just made me realize how messed up I am and has really hit me hard. I think about dieing because it relaxes me. I think there is an escape. I have just stared on meds and I fear that they will make my reassuring fantasy of killing myself seem more possible. I don't know if it the effect of the pills or just the shock of realizing how sick I am. Over the last year I have pushed everyone away. I have always been anti social and keep people at arms length. I don't have any close friends but I can go to the bar on a good day, chat ever one up, be charming as hell, even make plans to met up later with some of my 'new friends' and when the time comes I get gripped again with anxiety and I don't show. I am sure I come off like an ass, if I run in to one of me one night stand friendships, I feel awkward and just want to get out of the situation as quickly as possible. I have a husband but the marriage is very strained. He is extremely depressed and will not seek help. He refuses to go out with me and so he is starting to forget about the fun parts of me and only sees the upset, anxious and afraid to leave the house parts of me. I am sure that is not helping things. I just can't help shaking the feeling of being ill, tainted by mental illness, and ashamed I can't seem to help my husband. I often have hope, but sometimes I sink so deep in hopelessness I am afraid I will do something rash.

							Life hasn't exactly been fun for me so far. I had a very bad childhood full of emotional and physical abuse and one day when I was 13 a girl came to school with a bandage around her wrist. Rumors flew around class that she had tried to kill herself over the weekend and my first thought was fear. She came into the room and I saw the white bandage and could smell the distinct scent of ointment and something in my head just kicked in...I wondered what it would be like to slit my wrists...to die...to go to Heaven. From that moment on I flirted more and more with the idea of killing myself and, at the same time, I began to feel depressed. In no time my thoughts were consumed with suicide. For 10 years straight, every waking moment all I could think about was how much I wanted to die. Being socially awkward, I didn't have any friends, I never dated and, having social anxiety disorder, I was terrified to leave the house. I was quite literally trapped with my depression. "

He has expressed suicidal thoughts over the past year and each time the plans got more detailed.  2 weeks ago after a disagreeable day he left out an empty bottle of valium and an empty small bottle of vodka.  I freaked that he had OD'd and slapped him awake... then didn't stop hitting him.   All my rage came out that he would actually do that and I kept punching him after he opened his eyes.  He was not himself and we scuffled then he followed me out of the room with a gun in his mouth.  I ran screaming from our home and called the police.  I thought we would get an ambulance and he would get some treatment.  Instead he was arrested on domestic violence charges, spent the weekend in jail and now there is a state mandated restraining order.  None of which is helpful to our situation.

I've nourished big dreams and worked and honed my brains for them but didn't succeed. My father and teachers told me that I am an intelligent person, but I don't believe them, because why would I never get what I worked for? Now I'm into my final year of engineering and as much as I wanted to come first in my class, I'm almost the 20th in a class of 60. I used to think I have got good concepts but I recently attended a recruitment program in which I didn't even make it to the interview, had to leave after the written test. Even now if I'm doing problems my mind just clams up and I'm taking endless time to learn things that I would've learnt quicker 2 years ago. Besides, at times I get jitters and suddenly break into shivers every 5 minutes, my whole body trembling. I don't feel cold, I just see visions of me failing and being kicked around like a soccer ball by all my friends who've done better."

							I feel so invisible. It seems there is something appellate about me to all people. Guys aren’t attracted to me making my romantic life practically nonexistent. I AM ABSTINENT BTW and don't think this is the only reason why I can't find a boyfriend. Guys TRY key word TRY to treat me bad but I don't let them. In the process I come to understand how they look at me."

							I am having a really difficult time right now, I have never reached out like this before but I need to tell somebody about this.  I want to die.  There is no reason for me to stay.  I have nobody.  I stay shut up in my room for the entire day and nobody ever wants to do anything with me and for good reason.   I am boring as hell and have no good qualities.  My personal opinion is at an all time low and the worst thing is that it takes nothing for me to feel this way.  It is just the way it is.   It's a matter of desire.  I have no desire to stay in a place where I am so alone.  I just really need a hand right now.

I've done everything I can to not be like him but every year my mom says it more and more and she knows me more than anybody. I don't want to pass these traits on to any kids I might have but even if I don't have any kids I'll still be just like him. I've finally come to terms with the fact that I can't keep myself from becoming like him so it would be better if I just died. I have nothing in my life that I enjoy anymore. Before i was only staying alive for my friends and family but it is completely unfair for them to want me to stay alive only for their own pleasure.

					Suicide. The Wolf and the Caribou.
				","

							When I was younger, I remember watching a nature show which showed a baby caribou being chased by an adult wolf through the Canadian tundra. Although the Caribou was young, it could sprint with lightning pace and was capable of outrunning the wolf. However, it didn't have much stamina - something the wolf was blessed with. Although the caribou left the wolf in its wake in the first 1,000 yards, the caribou couldn't sustain the speed and the wolf's superior stamina prevailed. Needless to say, the wolf eventually caught up with the caribou and the animal's short life came to an end. I don't know why, but that moment is just one of those memories I've never quite been able to forget."

After he calmed down, she went and got him.  A week later (after numerous ""I'm fine now""s, extreme regret and sympathy), my mom found out that he was planning on doing it again (wouldn't respond to phone calls).

Nothing traumatic has happened to me to cause this surge of depressed thoughts to overflow into my head. They just seem to be there. I still laugh, work out, go to parties and such but I need to force myself. I've developed this bizarre feeling whenever someone asks to do something with me. All I really want to do is sit there and be that blob of flesh, bone, and guts. Yup. That's me, but I guess all people are just like that. Why the hell would someone want to post a tyrannosaurus icon, or have the need to for that matter? Why can't a die already? Today I actually found excitement in looking down the barrel of a handgun. I wish I had a good enough friend that would pull the trigger for me, but they're all too concerned with their own mental happiness and forget to think of mine. Honestly this is the only thing I'm selfish about. If I could take the place of a terminally ill person I would in a heart beat. Well damn, I'm terminally sick in the head so I guess I'll just wait my own turn. I'm done now, I need to return to sitting and breathing. Hopefully the latter of the sentence wont be true for long.

							When I look in the mirror, I don’t recognize myself anymore.  The reflection looking back at me only adds to my state of sadness.  My eyes are sunken in and dark circles have begun to form, despite the tan that I acquired this summer.  The tan only serves as a reminder of the downward spiral that I am riding.  I was so happy and content a few months ago, and now I can’t imagine what that felt like.  Going to bed at night is terrifying, because I know that sleep will only bring a sequence of horrible nightmares.  I had so many painful dreams about my ex last night.  I also can’t stop hearing the sound of a gun loading itself.  Sometimes it is a handgun, but usually it is a shotgun.  Click, Boom!  Click, Boom!  I don’t know what it means, but I wish it would stop.  It’s been going on for so long now, that it has started to occur when I am awake.  I only smoked 10 cigarettes last night, which is good because the recent norm has been about a pack a day.  I hate the damn things, but they provide a very temporary distraction from my emotional state.   It’s hard to believe that I feel this way because of a girl.  It’s true that I miss her immensely, but there is something more profound happening in my chemically imbalanced brain.  I am so sad and I can’t get out of it.  I’m trying, but nothing is working.  I don’t know what to do.  I feel like I have exhausted all of my friends with discussions about this stuff, and I have nowhere else to turn.  I’ve begun to have very unpleasant thoughts about my future.  I had a dream last night that I found a gun in the woods.  It was loaded and I wanted to do terrible things with it.  "

							I just can't get these irrational thoughts out of my head, that no one really likes me that I'm just some walking joke. The girl I'm interested in (who has always shown signs of interest back but its complicated) hasn't been able to contact me consistently cause her sister was in the hospital and her phone's been broken. I always ask her friend for moral support and he's always been a big help but he kinda ignored the issue for a week even though I just really needed some reality. I texted him a little bit ago saying 'I'm sorry I always get so supsicious I have aspergers and I've been doing research and it's sometimes linked to not understanding others motives'. He's one of her exes and her best friend and although she struggled with coming to terms that he doesn't like her like that anymore and thinks of her as more of a sister and she likes me too he's just been making things worse lately. After that he says 'Have you heard from her? her sister's out of the hospital I bought her a huge teddy bear as a recovery gift and I've been trying to contact her'. I couldn't help but blow up in his face not some jealous fit of rage or anything but just this intense amount of fear and anxiety. I was just telling him I wasn't able to be there for her and it makes me think she'll forget every nice thing I've ever done for her and she'll just forget about me and move on. This is completely irrational for these reasons: she just told me a month ago I was the coolest guy she knows and she wants to go out with me and be happy with me but I have to meet her parents first, her parents work on an oil rig they're out of town almost all the time, she just contacted me twice last week once to tell me her sister's out of the hospital then we discussed the parents thing a little and she told me they were home for the sister thing but she had no way of contacting me. I've just been telling her friend now that I'm sorry for blowing up in his face and I don't want him to think I'm nuts or anything and if he winds up telling her I've been a wreck lately just to mention I'll probably try to get some help. Despite any positive steps I try to take along those lines I just wake up some day thinking how can I even live day to day when I feel like even people that are close to me are keeping some huge secret from me?

Later that night I drank lots of pain killers with intent of going to sleep and never waking back up again, perhaps looking like I died in my sleep. The second attempt I planned was to make it look as if I was murdered. But what kept me going was the fact my oldest brother didn't graduate and I was going to be the first to do so and I did. That didn't do anything for me in life. I can't complain because I was privided for, mom did the best she could working 2 jobs and fighting off cancer to support all 4 of us."

I am not motivated in any way, I have no direction, no future, no life at this current moment and all I have been thinking about lately is who will miss me if I was gone. My family does not see me too much and they know nothing of my depression, school, lack of work or any details of my life at the moment. Surely, they will not miss me. In fact, nobody knows any of this about me since I bottle up all these feelings for fear of being judged, made fun of, cast off, etc. I am embarrassed of my entire existence as a human and feel I have not done anything with my life but spend my families money, lie, and pretend to be what I am not. I am 22 years old. I have a lot of life ahead of me and I need direction, guidance and a new beginning but I do not know how to begin or where to start.

							Ok so ive had suicidal thoughts since i was 12 im now 19 and the thoughts are getting more often and worse. At first it was over getting picked on and i just thought instead of killing myself id join the army when i was 18 and get killed in action. Back then the thoughts only came around every once in a while throughout high school the thoughts became more and more even though i had a good life going i had friends played sports and no family problems. but for some reason i would always think that life had no meaning or no point to it. i though why live if all you do is work your ass off to get money to survive and that lifes purpose was to work just to survive the next day. but then i met this amazing and beautiful girl who changed my whole thoughts on life. she made me feel like the luckiest kid in the whole world i was able to tell her everything. i thought i would be with her forever and she said the same. she made me feel good every day and gave me hope for my life i thought i found out why life had meaning. she was the first person i told that ive thought of killing myself. she got me to tell my parents i was depressed but they dont know that i wish i was dead. well recently she broke up with me and i still cry about it i feel worthless. she pretty much took back all those wonderful words that made me feel happy. she said there is no chance of getting back together and i lost it. the only way i can even be semi happy now is to distract myself with tv, school work and golf, but the rest of the day where im not doing those things i just want to die. its not like i can keep myself preoccupied every minute of everyday for the rest of my life. and the break up is not the whole reason for these awful thoughts its just the feeling of worthlessness and life not having meaning again. people say youll get over it just stick with it but i dont believe them because the thoughts have been here for 7 years now. its become to much for me, the only reason im still here is the fear of surviving suicide and not wanting to have my parents bury me. But now the things that used to hold me back are seeming like less of a good excuse to not do it. These thoughts have affected my life to much they hold me back from doing a lot of social things and the thoughts just bring my mood down even moer. If im still here by the end of the year itll because of me not wanting to hurt my family.

I came and really put myself out there, was as nice and sociable as I could be to try and make a lot of new friends and to get my life on track.

I was living in a very conservative city, but after getting laid off I had to move out of my own apt. and move back home with family in a small town in a very conservative area because I couldn't afford where I was living with no job.  I have a graduate degree and I went back for more education to finish a double BS in biotech and biology, and I was pursuing this when I was laid off.  I'm about 2 semesters away from finishing.  But, I've had a lot of problems with professors these last 2 years, harassing me in their courses, getting students to harass me in their courses, problems with them knowing personal things about me that I never told anyone at my school, my assignments suddenly disappearing after I turn them in.  I'm also a lesbian and even though I haven't dated anyone in 5 years, it seems the status of my sexuality has come out as I've been experiencing a lot of harassment at the restaurant where I've been working as a server these last 7 months.  I'm only out to a few family and friends and I've experienced a lot of rejection and lost a lot of friends after coming out.  My family hasn't been supportive about it either.  My mom acts like she's afraid to touch me or hug me any more and she always says, ""I don't know why you would choose to be gay?  Why can't you just find a nice man to be with?""  The thought of being with a man is repulsive to me.  After I came out, my mom called my grandma and aunt to tell them the news and then they told other family members.  Everyone treats me differently now and I can hear them snickering about it at family get-togethers.  "

					Attempted Suicide ...
				","

							About 2 months ago I had a really bad time, a lot of stress with school, work, kids and my husband (mostly fighting with my husband) and a fight with a friend of mine.. I ended up going home and having a few drinks and got more depressed and wanted to go to sleep so I smoked a bowl, then took a few vicodin, then really just didn't want to wake up anymore so I popped a handful of xanax and paxils and about 4 more vicodin.

							I don't know how to cope anymore. It's been nearly 7 weeks since I was dumped by my boyfriend of 4 years. We were living together and have now found our own places to flat with other people. I'm finding it near impossible to be without him. He was such a huge part of my life. I have attempted suicide twice since the breakup and tried saying goodbye to my ex but he wouldn't allow it and came to find me and he called the police. My life is just a mess at the moment. I'm in my last semester of university before I graduate and I have to keep my grades up to pass. I can't concentrate as he is always on my mind. I no longer see the point in doing anything as I think to myself, what's the point in living if I can't be with the one I love? "

I feel powerless to confront those who hurt and wronged me....hell, it's hard to say that because i feel like I'm unfairly blaming people for things. But the thing is, I blame people for the wrongs they cause; it's my choice to take my life and i don't blame anyone for that. I just wish the pain would stop. Sorry for being vague but like i said, it is hard to say everything because i feel somewhat ashamed.

							I'm always alone, my parents are divorced  and my mother doesn't come home from work until I'm asleep. I've talked to my teachers, social worker, guidance counselor and my mother. It seems like no one cares. Whenever I try to make friends it always seems like once class is done or when it comes to group activities they leave me out on purpose. I don't know if it's my generation but it seems I have nothing in common with anyone I meet. The kids I meet are always either into drugs/alcohol/fights or into getting ""1337 no scopes"" (whatever that is). Then there's these 11th/12th graders who make fun of me because I'm Asian and my passion for singing.  I guess I could factor in that ever since I've gotten gangbanged and sent to the hospital I've become socially awkward.  I'm always alone in my passion for singing and breakdancing, I never use to be like this until I moved. I want to move but I can't because of my horrible attendance. And yes I'm skipping school because every time I go to school I feel much worse then the previous time. I'm just contemplating about killing myself right now since it seems like nobody cares about me and killing myself won't really affect everyone around me. What's the point in living when I can end my suffering right now...

The less i talk and socialise with people the more recluse i become and the more depresseed i feel. its like a vicious circle.

Im 34 years old now and my life is in tatters and i have nobody - not even my family. i dont want to go on anymore. i just want to end it all because theres no point. Ive ruined my life and think its probably better for everyone if im gone and not a burden on their lives. Nobody likes me anyway. All i ever think about is hanging myself to end it all.

							I just need to vent... This week has been the worst of my life. Funny enough if you fast forward back in time to last week, before Friday, my life was feeling so perfect. I was dating a guy who seemed so amazing. He was caring and nice. I was very close to his family as well. We met early this summer after talking on a dating web site and it was beautiful from the start. He lives 10 minutes away. We told eachother what we wanted in the beginning, and that's a long term relationship that goes somewhere. We had talked it out enough times that we had both felt we found the kind of person we really wanted to be with. We hung out almost every day, the days we didn't were when he worked late. We went golfing with his family, went to an amusement park together, hung out with friends, went to parties, we had so much fun together. We had plans for even more fun times, like going to the beach together and traveling. On Friday another fun activity was planned, we went to his friend's bbq. Well little did I know, my world would turn upside down. We were all hanging out and eating food, having drinks. His male gay friend was there. Eventually my boyfriend got so drunk and he started making out with the gay friend. At first I thought it was a joke. I tried to laugh it off? In the morning we were all sleeping on the couches of the house and I woke up and noticed my boyfriend had a hickey on his neck. I asked him who it was from. Obviously it was from the other guy. Everything spiraled down from there. He and I fought. He told me he is confused about his sexuality. Never in my life would I suspect this behaviour to come from him. I feel so betrayed. I feel lied to. He always wanted to be intimate with me, and was very touchy feely with me all the time... I feel used. I wish he had told me these feelings in the first place and then I could've made a decision from there. But he lied to me... How dare he bring me around his house and get me involved in his family life, just to use me as a cover up? We met up 3 nights after. One night he said he thinks he is straight, he doesn't want to lose me and then the next day he said he is confused and thinks he wants to experiement and doesn't know who he is. This isn't fair to me at all. Both of our families found out about the situation. He blames everything on me, says I ""forced"" him to kiss the other guy and that it is all my fault. Excuse me but it was his decision. He was my boyfriend, the only person I wanted him to kiss was me. I've missed two days of work this week and to top it all off my dog was put down, I have had my dog since I was a child. I haven't been handling myself well. I am depressed right now and I am not myself. He will not talk to me anymore, he threw me away like trash. He told his family what happened and blames it on me, says his family life is awkward. But no, it is his fault. He chose to do everything in front of me and hurt me. He never had the decency to explore these hidden feelings in private and then decide to give me a choice. He had to do it in front of me and embarrass me! I feel like my whole summer is ruined. I hate missing work, I worked so hard for my career. Luckily my coworkers are understanding and are supportive of me and encouraged me to take today off to relax my mind so I can be in better shape next week hopefully. Unfortunately I can't stop feeling depressed and I wish I could feel better. My beautiful dog is gone, I miss him so much. And I am so alone. I never wanted to spend my summer alone. I hate myself because every relationship I have is full of abuse and always seems too good to be true in the beginning. He told me in the beginning he loved me and wanted nobody else, then betrays me in front of me. It doesn't matter if it was a guy or girl he did it with. Either way it is still wrong. I feel so worthless. Another guy who has come in my life, got super close to me and then did something awful to hurt me and then leave forever. I will miss the man I knew before Friday along with his family so very much. I loved them so much. I can't take the pain anymore. He was close to my parents and they are so angry at him for what he did and how he has acted towards me afterwards. They liked him and it's rare for my parents to really have a real liking for anybody I date, and now they will be reluctant to trust anybody else I bring around them all over again. I want to be in a good relationship that leads to marriage and a future. I have been saving up to buy a house and live the life I want but I will never have it. I am so tired of having to go through life alone. And I will never trust anybody ever again. Every time I let my guard down and be positive when I let a new man in my life, it heads for disaster. Why am I even here? I feel like my life is one cruel joke. I am so sorry this post probably makes no sense and is a bunch of jibberish nonsense... I have lost myself completely.


"
"
					Not alone? I am always alone.
				","

							I don't know where to start or end this. One place to start: I hate myself,I always have and I have a feeling I always will. And I come to realize it more and more about how much I don't care about myself, and how I care more about others. You see my life is pointless. I've figured out that all along god never existed. I used to hope and doubt that god existed but last month something clicked in me. I told myself that all along I was looking for nothing, and now I can't bring back that feeling of the doubtful hope that I had in god. I hate it. I feel like I've figured it all out and I feel so empty now. I wish I hadn't...that's just another reason to give up life. Another is my social life...my friends are horribly  ignorant people who laugh pointlessly at everything and live carelessly. I act just like them. All happy and  *  *  *  * . But honestly I just want them to shut the hell up and see reality. I'd rather be talking about politics and religion and all those innocent people dying in pointless wars everyday. I feel like I am wasting time, like I shouldn't be sitting here in school learning  *  *  *  * . I should be be out there in the real helping people through things like war and oppression. The people in the U.S are blind to the true realities of the world. And I'd rather die then just sit here and watch innocent people suffer. And honestly Ive been thinking about that a lot lately. Because I can't help. I am a  hopeless nobody. I had dreams. But they seem so fictitious. I mean I'm in high school, I'm 16 and my dream was to become a trauma surgeon. It won't happen. I know it. My grades arent bad but to get a career like that you need to have perfect grades. There's so many reasons why though. Like how my love life is always because both of the guys I have liked are drug addicts. I can never find anyone to relate to and have a decent conversation with. And I hate sitting here and watch the world pass by me...and watch all my classmates succeed and stay happy like they always were. I want to die for so many reasons. I've been thinking of ways to do it. The least painful. I want everyone to see me dead. Because as much as they may say they care, all these friends only pretend they knew and make up fake stories about what an amazing person I was when honestly it's just  *  *  *  *  that's covering up how much they hate me. They just say that stuff to make themselves look like they give a  *  *  *  * , but they just want other people's empathy. I want my parents to see my dead body and see that all these strict restrains they had on me werent ever from the better. This was the only reality they couldn't prevent from happening. They would surprised because I seemed like a such a happy person, despite the fact that I had a suicidal past. They would remember all the times I had told them ""I am going to commit suicide  if this or that happens"" they thought everything I said was joke. They always did. They took me for a joke, and  they always say that I am the worst thing that ever happened to them. It's always about my perfect sister... *  *  *  *  this bringing back  *  *  *  *  I didn't want toremember...makes me want to  *  *  *  * ing kill myself this second. Besides...I do want to see what was always going on on the other sides ......ugh

							Hi everyone. I can't really discuss this issue with my family. I've tried with friends but it seems like they dont really understand. I've thought about ending my life so many times during the past 3 months. I'm 22 and 5 months ago my ex-fiance proposed to me a month after he moved to LA, California. He proposed a plan that i would move there in August after i graduated from college and did not want me to transfer out there before i graduated because it would make transferring my credits difficult. I didnt worry too much because I was confident that our love was strong enough to survive 6 months apart. I love this man more than i love myself and was happy when he proposed because i want to spend the rest of my life with him. We had also lost the baby that i was carrying almost 2 years before the move so seeing him so involved to want to marry me and start the family that we always wanted just made me so happy. 3 months ago I received a text message saying that he didnt want to be with me anymore without any explanation. He had began becomng emotionally and mentally abusive to me a few weeks before the breakup and then would apologize saying that he didnt mean to be so mean to me, and because i loved him, I still stood by him.

					Life worsens, wants to commit suicide HELP
				","

							Well I am 18 years old and my life continues to worsen. I will explain a bit about myself and the reasoning behind my dark temptations of commiting such a terrible act. Ever since I was 11 years old I have suffered severe epilepsy to the point where I have grand mal (intense convulsion) seizures daily. My school has always been interrupted, constantly made fun of by other people. My memory is worsening and so is my hearing. I have had severe side effects from almost every possible epileptic medication there is and now I do not really see a point in living. Not only do I deal with seizures but I deal with other stresses such as my family which is extremely poor at the moment since one of my parents lost their job and a sibling which seems to have deep hatred for me; probably because they haven't matured and may be jealous of the attention I receive for having such a disorder. I still am not sure. But I hate my life. I have called suicide hotlines and everything but I truly just hate myself."

					Can someone please tell me the world isn't that bad
				","

							I think I am addicted to making myself unhappy.  I try not to watch or read the news because its never good and it makes me depressed, but I can't stop.  I'm drawn to the stories that will make me have a negative reaction.  For instance, today I clicked on a story about women's rights in the military and I read all the comments people made.  Bad idea because every other one was some sort of sexist rant.  Things like that make me really upset, and hate men, or wish I was one so I wouldn't have to deal with these feelings.  I knew beforehand there would be comments like that, but I read them anyway.  I'm loosing faith in humanity.  I'm not sure I want to live in this world.  I don't think I would take my own life, but if I happened to die an early death it would be all for the better.  I don't think i'm strong enough to survive in a world where people kill, rape, steal, and generally tear each other down.  But all these feelings right now are a result of reading all that crap.  I try to tell myself that there are good people in the world too, but on some level I can't let myself believe it.  "

Basically, I am almost 39 years old, working a crappy paying part time job, living with my mom, who has friends that treat me like  *  *  *  * . I have no hope for my future at all. I want to die now more than I ever have. The only thing that keeps me from doing it is the thought of my family crying over my casket. I don't want to do that to them, but I also can't keep living like this. I am at my lowest low right now. I am trying so hard to compose coherent sentences, all I wanna do is cry, scream, break things, run away, or go park my car in the garage with the door shut and take deep breaths. I honestly don’t know how long I can continue living my life. I can feel my entire body filling up with what feels like evil, it makes me feel sick, it makes me feel like I have thick black goop running through my veins, it makes my throat feel like it’s closing up, it makes my head feel like 1000 gallons of tears could come bursting out of it at any time…and there is no way to make all this  *  *  *  *  go away!! I am stuck in my body, I can’t get out, and I can’t make all this  *  *  *  *  get out of me! I can’t even cry right now because I  *  *  *  * ing live with my mom and she could walk in on me anytime!!  *  *  *  * !!!!!!"

I can't see a therapist right now; it's complicated. Not taht I'm unwilling, I just CAN'T. I have not told anyone about what happened though; I tried to talk to one friend but now I'm being ignored. I would just really like to tell someone what happened. I know it's stupid but it'd mean a lot to me."

The world is  *  *  *  *  and the only reason i have not drank my self to death or overdosed is because of my husband and child but at this point i don't even know if i am good for them. My own family hates me and i cant get a good job. I cant go to college to get a good job because i don't have money because i don't have a job. Ever since i moved out of my moms house and got married i have come to reality with the fact that our world is just a  *  *  *  *  cycle! Nothing fixes it because EVERYTHING is  *  *  *  * . I know my child and husband would miss me dearly but at this point i am no help to them, i am so stressed that the littlest noise makes me jump because my nerves are so bad, my face twitches uncontrollably, my emotions are so unstable that i am crying one second and laughing the next (serious). I don't even know why i am writing this, guess its caus i cant get my hands on any hard drugs, so i have to just stick around till then i guess....

							Yes, I don't know the majority of you. I haven't became friends with anyone or talked to anyone on this site, besides when I've posted threads. However, you all are beautiful, wonderful, great people and I love every one of you. You all have something special that can't be taken away from you, no matter how harsh your life is or how bad things seem. You and the very life you live today is worth a LOT more than you make it out to be. There is someone out there who will cry the day you die and cares about you more than you believe they do. I understand we are all trapped souls in this world but you are all unique in your own way and nobody can tell you otherwise. There are people out there who love you and care about you, but just because you don't know they exist or you're not even friends with them doesn't mean they're not out there. We all want to believe in love and we all want to believe that there are people out there who will always look out for us through thick and thin. Well, there are. You might not find them today or tomorrow but they exist. I just wanted to let you know that I appreciate every single soul on this site that takes the time to write out their feelings and is strong enough to confide in us. We are a family and we love each other and we will always support each other, no matter what. If you ever need someone to vent to or someone for advice and you're hurt and too scared to post on here, please NEVER hesitate to talk to me."

							compared to many people. my life is awesome. im a 15 year old boy, rich, have tons of friends, and yet right at the start of may i became depressed now a night doesn't go by where i dont think about what it would be like to kill myself. i have never been bullied, i have never been neglected or disliked and i have my 3 best friends (who are girls) i tell everything. i have so many things to be happy about yet im not enjoying anything life offers me anymore. i started doing drugs, and it didnt really change anything. it helped for like 40 minutes. so i stopped. now i spend each day putting a mask on. with my family and friends i act like the old happy fun guy i used to be. but at night when noone can see me i become depressed, sad and angry at everything and i just want to kill myself. at the start of may i also got insomnia and i havnt slept a single night this summer more that 5 hours. i only sleep 0-5 hours a night. and thats not helping anything. i feel like there is no meaning for my existence. im just another drugged up teenager who doesnt care about anything. my favorite teacher ever showed me a quote.

					back to the bottom of my cycle....
				","

							so i've realized (a couple times now) that i have an emotional cycle.  its not a roller coaster because it doesnt start and end.  it just goes round and round and round and there is nothing i can do about it.  basically what happens is my life starts taking a downward turn.  and not just like something bad here and there.  its everything at once.  my job goes to hell, my family starts acting like they dont care anymore, i cant find any friends to talk to, my depression gets bad, i loose my girlfriend or prospect of a girlfriend, i run out of money....and it all happens at the same time.  what sucks is that after all this stuff happens everything starts getting better again.  i magically have friends, my family starts being there for me, i get a new job or a raise, girls start just showing up my depression goes away,  everything just goes wonderfully for a while.  here's the catch.  there is a perfect pattern that keeps happening (3 times now since i noticed it)  there are 2 turning points.  when my life starts going to hell it keeps getting worse and worse until i decide i want to kill myself.  and not just like thinking about it.  i have to come up with a plan and be just about to off myself when suddenly everything just falls into place and my life is wonderful.  the turning point when things start getting worse again is when i decide that i am going to not kill myself.  and these changes happen almost instantly.  i mean its within 6 hours of me making the decisions that everything just flips around.  so right now i'm heading down a bad spiral that is going to end up with me wanting to kill myself.  oh and by the way i have tested this theory out last time it happened by deciding at the beginning that no matter what i was going to keep my chin up and not kill myself.  but life just kept getting worse until i finally gave up and was ready to die.  then that day i got a phone call from a girl and she wanted to hang out so she could kiss me.  the next day every other piece of my life fell into place.  and just as perfectly as that worked out as soon as i admitted that things were going good and i wanted to keep living... crap hit the fan within 12 hours.  so now i'm headed back down the path to wanting to die and right now i want to just skip the part where my life gets progressively worse and just end the cycle and off myself.  but unfortunately i'm a nice guy and for some messed up reason i cant shake the habit of considering other peoples happiness over my own.  so i've been sticking around because my grandpa wants me to.

							i think that my depression comes from a different place than some others. i am not saying that i am better than them, because that simply is not true. i just feel that it isn't one of those situations that you can push through or hang on tight until it is over, because it never will be. let me explain: i have irritable bowel syndrome. it is bad to me, although i'm sure others have it worse. i am grateful, but the constant nausea, abdominal pain, and other side effects and making things quite unbearable. i have no social life. i've tried tons and tons of medications, none of which did much good. the solution would seem to be just go to the doctor and get something else, right? problem is that my condition prevents me from working, but i am unable to qualify for disability. that means no insurance, no money, pretty much just draining away at this point. my parents have been supporting me ever since and i'm 25 now, 26 soon, and i'm in quite a bind... and my insides are churning around, making it quite miserable on a regular basis.

Every night i got to sleep thinking tomorrow is going to get better but it's worse then the next day. I never have good days and im constantly unhappy. My only friend that knows keeps telling me to tell someone but no listens. My parents are anti-trans and wouldn't accept me. I hate myself as well. I dont look female at all and growing too tall. I wish this pain would stop but it doesn't. I also have no dreams or expectations, I figured i wouldnt live past 21 so i have no future plans. As you can read my life really sucks.

His little sister is devastated, she loves me like a sister. I've ruined my relashionship with them completely. I have to be supervised by my parents in everything I do.

							I've thought about killing myself for a few years now, when I was a teenager, I didn't think I would live past 21 - since I always planned on killing myself by then. I am 23 and all I want to do is die. I have had my heart ripped out by a guy I loved and spent 2 and a half years, with I thought he loved me too but it was all a lie. I have nothing to live for now. My parents and family will move on, so I don't feel bad about leaving them, my friends will soon forget about me. So really I have nothing to live for. I have please my parents already by going to university and getting the education they wanted me to get. I have never been able to follow my dreams and do what I wanted to do. I don't even know who I am, what I like, what makes me happy. All I know is what other people have me to believe, I have no special talents, I'm not special, I'm just me mediocre in every way. I just need to find the strength to take my own life. Life has no meaning when you have no one to talk to, to confide in, to trust with your most intimate secrets. I can't tell my parents, they are too judgemental to understand and I'm pretty sure my friends don't care. I wish I could die in my sleep or something, that way I could be dead without killing myself.

							Two months ago my girlfriend of 16 months broke up with me out of the blue.  I had been having a very difficult time with finals for my senior year of college, but everything had seemed fine until she didn't come home until 6-7ish in the morning two nights in a row, which was very unusual behavior for her.  That's when she told me she didn't feel like she wanted to date me anymore, broadsiding me completely.  She had said she wanted to figure out what she needed in her life at the moment, and I was willing to respect it, however brokenhearted I felt.  I was really busted up that day, and moved out to stay with my parents so that she would still have a place to stay.  I managed to hang in there for a week while one of my friends came up to help me through it, but a week later on graduation I woke up to a Facebook status telling e she was in a new relationship.  A relationship with a mutual friend, who we had also been planning on living with.  I've been on a downward spiral ever since.  All of my long term plans had included her, and now I've found myself shoved aside for another guy.  Everything that I used to do to amuse myself has become as appealing as eating ash.  I see a therapist weekly, and have been for the past three years, but I find that it helps less and less.  I feel like a complete waste of life, I can't motivate myself to look for a job, have any optimism, or even get out of the house.

I say, thank God for the baseball season and the New York Yankees. If it wasn't for my love of baseball and my favorite team, I don't know what I'd do or how I'd react. I want to try and stick around to see them win. I know this sounds stupid, but if I can inspire anyone who reads this to find that one thing (anything, no matter how simple it may be) to keep them around today, tomorrow and hopefully a full lifetime, I would be happy. I know how hard it is for all of you struggling. However, please try and find that one thing that brings some joy to you and latch on to it. I know I have and hope all you can as well. Peace.

							So basically I've been suicidal since I was 11 I'm currently 16 and have everything planned on how and when I'm going to do it. I want to get help but it's impossible to do without telling my parents. They would say that I am faking it.  I suffer from social anxiety so that makes everything worse since I have no friends that could help. I feel like things aren't going anywhere and have given up on trying to behave like a normal person. I can't remember the last time I didn't wish that I wouldn't wake up when I fall asleep at night. I also have depression that has been getting worse to the point where it's hard to smile anymore. Not sure how I would go about getting help or even if its worth trying.

So now I'm 30, have a good job, have 2 dogs that for the past 2 years have kept me from getting worse after my ex of 8 years left me. Suicide has always been there and big events make it worse. I got through 2yrs ago because of my dogs. But now I feel that's not enough. I've asked my ex to take the dogs this summer. Its almost like I want things to be all taken care of if I decide to ever call it quits. I don't have much, no kids, I'm only close with my dad and that bothers me the most how he'd be affected. Cause I knowledge he'd be devastated. My mom and my sister I really don't care howd they be affected. I just don't see the point to this anymore. I go through the motions of life and really just want it all to be over.  I don't if I'd ever be able to go through with suicide, but the thought of it seems to give me some kind of relief. I have been to therapy, but it only gives me a short term feeling of relief, like a day at most.  "

							When I was six years old, my dad killed himself. Everyone tells me I am better off, and I believe them. From what I remember of him, he was always very angry. He never really gave me much attention except to yell at me for something. It was very rare if he ever actually played with me. Whenever I cried about something, if I were hurt or something he would get impatient with me. If he was at home, and I wanted to be with him, he would get impatient with me. I only have a few happy memories of him. Sometimes I kind of wonder if he resented me. Him and my mother only got married because he got her pregnant with me. Plus my mom had my older sister, so he was doing the right thing I guess by giving her a father and staying for my sake. However, from what I've heard he didn't really want kids at that age. He was 21 and my mom was 20."

Just wondering how you go about the will since I read you need witnesses when you sign it and to make sure someone fills your last wishes.. which you can't really cause then people would suspect you are going to kill yourself and try to stop you...

I guess I should start by saying that I have suffered from depression and social anxiety for as long as I can remember. Both have gotten significantly worse during these past few years. At first, I didn't know who to go to so I spoke to my bestfriend and told her exactly how I felt. She was really a great person. If it wasn't for her, I think I wouldn't be here right now. She was very helpful. But several months later, she made new friends and completely pushed me out of her life.. I was so hurt because she was the first person who I had ever been able to trust so much. Once again I was left alone. I have made many other friendships but I keep to myself now. Soon after I felt like I was digging myself into an even deeper hole. I started using drugs(meth, ecstasy,and several other junk) as a way to feel ""better"" but of course I only made things worse. A couplemonths ago I stopped using drugs. I went to a therapist. I lied to her about my drug use. And many other things as well. I find it hard to be able to pour out your feelings and pretty much anything to a complete stranger. She said she couldn't help me because I wasnt really cooperating. Although she was able to figure out that I was depressed and had SA. I honestly feel like there's no one to help me. I feel so alone. I'm always constantly thinking about committing suicide (by the way, I used to self harm as well. Now I have a bunch of nasty burnt scars on my arms) the only way to escape those thoughts is by sleeping. But that's only a short escape because unfortunately, I always wake up and feel just as I had before. I've been thinking about hurting myself again. But most of all, I just don't wanna be alive anymore.

It was so severe that my lips were literally covered in dry bloody scabs and every part of my body would fall off like dandruff when i rubbed it. Some kids in elementary school picked on me because of that. I had to always cover my mouth with my sleeves whenever in public to @ least hide my lips. I was always alone in school and had some teachers come up to me and tell me to go make some friends. I was always self-conscious and had social anxiety. I would even be afraid and nervous when the teachers come up to me, thinking that the kids would make fun of me over that fact. I always had so many things going on in my head simultaneously. I was a very quiet kid. Too quiet to the point where I wouldn't say a single word in group activities. In school, I never successfully pulled off an activity which required me to talk in front of the class and even introducing myself to people was something i just couldnt do. i would just sit there and wait until the teacher had realized that I have very severe anxiety and just give up on me and call the next person up. I was very abnormal. I had never seen or even heard a kid like me in all my life. I feel like as though I am not human, but literally a deformed trash."

I cant put up with everything anymore. Im depressed and stressed out. My mom and her boyfriend have been fighting for 2 days straight, to the point where i thought someone would call the cops. I cant take the yelling anymore. They finally stopped and now i have the worst headache in the world. I already have myself to worry about and all my problems, then i gotta deal with their drama. Nothing will ever get better, it just keeps getting worse and worse. unfortunately i have no where else to live right now, so im stuck with all of this, i cant do it anymore im tired. I have so much stress it feels like a thousand pounds on my shoulders. I cant live like this, im so alone. Nobody cares, i know everybody says that but there is nobody that cares how i feel. I have a whole bottle of pills that knock you out like sleeping pills, i think bout just swallowing them all and just falling asleep and never wake up. Nobody understands what im going through right now. Im suffering and it hurts, and i feel stupid admitting that. I give up, the pain is too much for me to take anymore.. If you knew how i feel inside then you would understand why i want to be dead. No one should have to feel this bad. God must really hate me.

					So I was thinking........................
				","

							This is the perfect time to die. I don't see any point in living. I never asked to be here and f**** hate being alive. Everything and everybody is a major disappointment...... I know life is unfair but my life is f****** ridiculous. There is no 'good advice"" or advice that is going to make me change my mind so don't waste your time with that cheesy  bs. "
,"

							I'm 24. I have been very upset for a long time now.  It's actually very rare that I am happy these days.  My girlfriend of close to two years and I broke up June of 2010.  I broke up with her for another girl.  Last year in January, I left her to pursue an internship at Disney World, Orlando.  The moment I got there I started to change.  She called me and I wouldn't answer.  She'd txt me and I'd ignore her.  When we did talk, all we did was fight.  But when she came to visit, I immediately fell back in love with her.  But when she left, I started to ignore her again.  I believe now that it was all because of my addiction to alcohol or loneliness or trying to curb loneliness with alcohol.  My roommates even said they noticed something was up with me but didn't want to tell me.  Anyways, when I came home, I found out my sister had died 3 weeks before I got home.  She and I didn't really have a good relationship at all.  When I was 11 she was sent to a correctional school or school for troubled youth.  And I've rarely seen her since then.  She turned to drugs and consistent partying, had two kids that my parents now take care of and now she's dead."

					Why I want to kill myself
				","

							I am almost 17 years old. I'm from Eastern Europe. I am an orphan and up to 14 years I lived in an orphanage. Then a family came and adopted me. I thought I was lucky and I'll finally be happy. My new parents took me to England. Here my father raped me several times and then sold me to a pimp. For over two years I've been forced to prostitute myself, beaten, tortured ... A year ago I tried to kill myself . I failed and because I tried to kill myself the pimp have put me into a cage where I spent a week only with water. A month ago I managed to run away to escape. Now I'm in another city and hide in an abandoned house. I met an old woman that I help with little things and she let me on the computer. She does not know my history. I believed that everything will be fine. But every night I have nightmares, I'm afraid of any man who looks at me in the street. I can not resist anymore. I think I go crazy. I don't have a friend or a person to tell my problems and my fears. I think that the only solution is to try again and to succeed this time.

							Ive had plenty of time to think about this and i feel low enough to the point where i want to take my life, and end this. Its never going to get better. Im already going to counseling and taking medicine, and it does nothing. Theres no light anymore, i have no hope. Everything is negative in my life. I dont wanna be around anyone anymore cuz its all just all lie. Im just putting on a front whenever im with anybody, they dont care how i feel so theres no point in showing anything and just act normal. Im tired of being lonely and empty, i feel like i dont even belong on this earth. Im tired of feeling anything anymore. i cant take this pain and suffering everyday, i have nothing left, no will to even try and keep on going and hope things get better. Im not meant to be here, i dont belong anywhere. I have to do this, i just feel like its what i have to do. I dont want this life i cant do it. Everyday i think about ending it all. My life is so messed up, my life is all bad since i was a baby. The damage has already been done, theres nothing anyone can do to change the things that ive been seen or been through. I dont have anyone to be there when i need them. I dont have any trust or faith in anyone anymore, all i have is myself. Thats why i need this to stop, i cant live any longer feeling like this.

					Emotional blackmail?
				","

							About 15 years ago my younger cousin would threaten to kill herself whenever her boyfriend who was her high school sweetheart tried to break up with her. They have been married now for a while and have two young kids. Her sister, another cousin of mine, also threatens to commit suicide if her family doesn't financially support her while she pursues her dream of becoming an actress in LA. She now has a child who she is grooming for show business. My theory is that my cousins threaten to commit suicide because they are spoiled brats, endulged, and throw tantrums when they don't get their way. I even think they may have personality disorders. I don't believe they would ever take their own lives. However I would like to see my family call their bluff and institutionalize them fir a couple if days with their next suicide threat. People in my family are actually afraid of them. They believe these women have strong personalities and that's why they get their way. Now they have kids of their own and their children throw temper tantrums beyond what would be normal, screaming, kicking, throwing stuff.

							I've been thinking about death a lot lately. I'm not really depressed or sad or anything, I just don't see any point in life. I don't believe in a god, an afterlife, or anything like that. It all just seems so meaningless. What difference does it make if I die today, or 60 years from now? I'll still be dead, and those 60 years won't have affected anything. I just don't feel like putting up with another 60 years of bull *  *  *  * . I have 100 tablets of tylenol/acetaminophen (500mg each, 50,000mg total), an 8oz bottle of robitussin DM/dextromethorphan, and 60 caplets of aleve/NSAID (220mg each, 13,200mg total). If I were to take all of that, and then drink a few beers and some vodka, would that be enough to kill me, or would I just pass out and wake up in a hospital screaming in pain?

							I think I'm done. Can't cope with life for much longer. All these up and downs, feeling confident one minute, like dirt the next.. I've just had enough, I simply hate everything about myself and that's never going to change. I'm constantly being faced with people so much more fortunate than me and I can't  *  *  *  * ing take it! I've had to listen to my cousins boyfriend go on about how he was featured in a teenage girls magazine and just hearing that  *  *  *  * ing made me feel like jumping out the nearest window. I am not who I want to be physically, and there is nothing in this world I can do to change that so what other option is there really? Nothing that's what. My hatred of myself has prevented me from even pursuing a normal life. I opted out of moving abroad for college cause of it, I don't socialize due to it, I just don't have anything close to a normal life. I'd much rather end it, and leave with some dignity. So  *  *  *  *  it, final year of my life approaching. Cheers and  *  *  *  *  you miserable piece of  *  *  *  *  of a body.

Makes me wonder if that disgusting piece of meat was also  cheating on me behind my back.(probably.) On the surface she was awesome to me and supportive but now I see her as an impostor she used me...

My body is completely wrecked because I'm constantly eating and I've lost count of how many scars and bruises I have. So I can't attract the people I want. I've spent 5 years of my life under the thumb of a girl who mucked me about and never knew what she wanted and I have to see her 5 days a week and I hate it. The guy I want to be with I can't be with, and my childhood is so mucked up I can't understand it. My friends are getting fed up of my constant moodiness and the fact that I always need them there for me because I'm pathetic when it comes to looking after myself because I always end up doing the wrong thing. I don't see the point in my life because it's not going to go anywhere. I'm losing the ability to see a future.

					My cousin committed suicide but has been revived

							This happened a few hours ago my grandmother found him hanging from the closet. He was purple. My cousin Alex began Cpr while my grandmother called 911. There was no response as my cousin was dead. The ambulance were able to revive him. I'm still waiting on the news as to where the hospital is and what his current status is. I know that if you hang yourself there is a great possibility that you will have brain damage. I'm assuming the belt or rope whatever used didn't snap his neck because it was done in a closet. Does anyone know the time you have before you actually get brain damage? Hopefully he doesn't end up paralysed or a vegetable. All my grandma cares about is his needs and him all about him. If he doesn't pull through she's going to croak. She literally will have nothing to live for because that's what is keeping her going as of now. Does anyone know the time frame? I'm assuming he was dead for more than 5 minutes is there brain damage?

							I am 19 years old. I have researched suicide topics before and I always hear stuff like suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem or that I have so much to live for ETC. When it comes to me these people are wrong. I have thought about suicide since I was 11 years old and literally every day since starting high school at the age of 14. How is that temporary? I have thought about suicide for nearly half my life and there is no end in sight. I picture myself hung up in the garage, belt around my neck all the time. I imagine if I was able to find a gun I would have been dead a long time ago because I am to scared of getting hurt or someone finding me before I die if I try to hang myself. As for the second thing of having something to live for, I really don't. Some people will be like oh you are exaggerating but I am not just gonna make  *  *  *  *  up. I constantly make lists of why I should kill myself and they are like three pages long. First of all I have never had friends. At the moment right now I have one friend. Yes, one friend who I hang out with occasionally and two other guys I text but hang out with like twice a year. My parents tell me that I just got to try talking to people more but I literally can't because I have nothing to say and when it comes to girls my voice gets shaky and I end up looking at my feet. I have never kissed a girl let alone having a girlfriend. My favorite things to do in the world is play sports. I played hockey and I was the worst player on my team in the worst division. I played baseball and I quit after grade six because I got one hit all year (dead serious) and never got to pitch because I couldn't throw hard enough. I am a ginger (don't even act like it doesn't matter, 99% of girls find that very unattractive), I have acne all over my body, I am obese and tried to lose weight by changing my eating habits and working out, didn't work and now I can't afford a gym membership. I took a year off after highschool and worked at  *  *  *  * ing walmart for the year as a cart pusher even though it was only part time because I was to scared to get a real/new job because of my fear of new people and learning new things. I currently go to university, but its off campus for the morons who didn't meet the requirement of 70 %(Thats how dumb I am) to get into the actual university. I am currently getting 60's while only taking three easy classes, it is clear that I am not going to make it after this year and I have wasted my parents money. I cannot go into a trade because I am very afraid of screwing up and showing my idiocy to people. I can barely do simple tasks. The only things that used to make me happy were watching/following all major sports and listening to music, those things don't even make me happy anymore. I take no interest in watching hockey/baseball/football, which I used to do all the time and I don't even dl music anymore, I used to have 2000 songs. Sometimes I just sit in this chair with my computer on staring at the google homepage for hours. To top it all off, I am the black sheep of my entire family. My one younger brother (grade twelve) has a girlfriend, is skinny, brown hair one of the most popular kids at his school, great at sports and plans to be an electrician right after he graduates. My other younger brother (grade ten) is also skinny, TONS of friends, blonde hair,  and gets 90's. I have eleven cousins and all of them have tons of friends, are all skinny, good at everything they do. My seven older cousins all have great jobs (two engineers, two mechanics, teacher, speech therapist, Business), they all have clear faces, NO red hair and funny enough they are all in relationships longer then a year, the majority live with their boy/girlfriends. I also wake up every day feeling like  *  *  *  *  and with a big headache. I got glasses after complaining of headaches because my right eye is weak and I was apparently straining it, the glasses helped for about three weeks and the headaches reappeared. My body aches constantly and I am always tired no matter how much I sleep.  I am never going to be able to make friends, get a girlfriend who genuinely likes me and that I genuinely like, all of a sudden become good at something. I am not even close to my siblings and I see my cousins, aunts and uncles literally three times a year. The only people who will be sad to see me dead are my parents. My siblings/cousins/aunts may care for a little bit and then just forget. Approximately 30 people might show up for my funeral and just my one friend (maybe). People say that suicide is a selfish choice, but the real selfish thing is to expect people to continue living a life they hate every day. I wake up every day thinking ""is this the day I finally kill myself?"" and I go to bed thinking ""Damn do I ever wish I was dead"". I literally thought today was going to be the day I was gonna hang myself. I was gonna get it all set up and was going to call the police seconds before I was going to kick the chair out from under me so they can find me dead instead of my parents. I know this is long and I doubt anyone reads it... it also looks like it was written by someone with the mental capacity of a second grader (not surprising), but my end is near and I am hoping that my lifeless body hangs from the roof of my garage by noon tomorrow. Goodbye world.

I dont have anything specific to complain about, I'm just not happy.. I have a constant aching feeling in my chest and my stomach from being upset all the time.. I get sad and upset to the point of making myself sick, literally. I just don't see a point to life anymore, all we do is work our whole lives then die in the end. I would have killed myself already, just like my dad did, but i know it would kill my mother.. [no pun intended]. It would devistate her just like it did when my dad killed himself.. But I'm not happy.. And I hate suffering every single day just to make her happy, because every day i wake up and feel a little worse than before.

							A long time ago, I walked into a WC intending to kill myself.  It didn't take, and the recovery in the hospital was agonizing.  I was hooked up to six machines (maybe more) and denied access to the bathroom.  If I did have to go, it had to be in front of a security guard.  A tech came along at some point as well, telling me he was going to catheterize me for a urine sample.  I knew it wasn't his idea so I told him to tell the head nurse to go have sex with herself, then I sat up and forced out the amount they'd needed.  I'd learned what I was in for if I ever decided to try again.  Adding insult to injury, a few people I knew, who hadn't been there, told me they doubted the legitimacy of my suicide attempt."

							It just seems like I'm out of options.   I've tried therapy and meds, getting back into exercising, taking an interest in new things.  I've tried to put myself out there in hopes that something might make me feel better, but nothing really does.  The anxiety and depression continue to linger over me.  Everything about my life sucks, and I feel like I'm stuck.  In other posts, I've talked about my job and how I'm not satisfied by it.  I wanted to go back to school, but to do that I would have to quit my job.  I tried working and going to school the first time around, and it didn't work out for me.  Seeking treatment throws another variable into this, because if I quit, I lose my insurance, and won't be able to get treatment.  I'll sink deeper into depression, and there won't be any point in anything."

							I just had a really bad weekend... Went to go see a person who I haven't seen in years. Somebody I dated years ago but we broke it off because of distance. He and I had seemed to never really stop liking each other, and have flirted on and off for years. I went to go see him on the weekend and was disturbed by who he became.. I got used and feel terrible... Its kind of like finding out Santa isn't real all over again. I feel like I got punished for something I didn't do (his ex wasn't good to him) and I had to pay for somebody else's mistakes. It wasnt fair to me. I feel so destroyed inside, I can't even cry anymore. I feel emotionless and dead. I've had a whole lot of terrible dating experiences this year. My ex broke up with me and then I went on a string of bad dates with some really psychotic guys. Now my faith in there being good men out there is completely gone. And even if theres a good guy for me waiting, I don't even want him. I am so done.. I feel so alone and just want to disappear for good. I am a nice girl, I think I am attractive, I have a good career I've worked hard at.. I am not a loser but I get treated like one by every guy. I put in my 100% towards people and get slapped in the face with disrespect. I am starting to question if I have any worth in this world. Got another pack of smokes, I thought I had quit for good, now I just really don't care about myself anymore. Sorry, really needed to vent somewhere.

I can't go anywhere with my friends because I really don't have any, since I graduated from high school I've lost contact with everyone, I'm really too shy to go out and make new ones or I don't even know where to start. I feel like I'm way too weird, that I'm completely different from everyone else and most of the time I can't go anywhere because I hate myself so much. I've lost about thirty pounds in six months and I'm not sleeping because the thoughts of being alone and not having any real plan in my life is killing me. It scares me that I'm thinking of actual plans to off myself, I've never thought like that before and everyday, the feeling seems to get worse and worse.

							Mental ill health (in all it woeful & wonderful forms) and suicide often go hand in hand. So whether it be nature or nurture, situational or a passed down heirloom courtesy of a long extended rotting family tree, I'm curious as to what lifelines might prompt people around these parts to endure a lifelong crooked perception and toxic line of thinking. So to those who in the past have and/or currently entertain thoughts of forcing the hand of a premature end...what is it that keeps you tethered to this world?"

							Everything in my life has gone wrong. I have been unemployed now since February and haven't had any luck in finding a job because I get very bad anxiety attacks when I go out in public, so I rarely leave the house. The anxiety is actually the main reason why I had to quit my job as a delivery driver at Papa John's. I have a condition called Asperger's Syndrome which is a mild form of Autism, the only area of my life that it impairs is my social skills. I have horrible social skills at best and it has led me to develop severe social anxiety, so as a result I have no friends and spend all of my time at home and I'm a very dependant person, so much so that I still live with my parents.  I've attempted suicide twice this year, but my parents haven't found out about the attempts. I did see a psychologist last year, but it didn't help. I've had depression since I was 12 and I've seen a total of three psychologists since then and was even put on prozac for about a year, but nothing ever works. I have nothing to look forward to, my life is worthless, all I have to look forward to is being alone and misunderstood.

Ive never had any proper friends and no one eva says anything nice about me. I dont want to live anymore because i know theres no point. im unhappy all the time and all i want to do is cut myself and hurt myself so i can see the blood and know its hurting in front of me. is there anyone feeling like me? i dont think so! so all i want to do is finish it all. ive made up my mind and no one is going to make me change my mind so dont even anyone try. so ive made up my mind and now i just want to find out the best and easiest and most least painful way of killing myself. I sometimes think of jumping off somewhere and it will all be over. but then i tihnk I want to take an overdoes so they can find me and realise how guilty they should all feel. I dont want to be found when i haven't died as that would make things just worse. But I dont want to die alone. I want to do it properly and I want someone to show me how or tell me what I need to do.

							I have lost the love of my life. Our children will never exist. My future is gone. I planned on proposing on our four year anniversary but she gave up on us a few months before that. Between our birthdays. It has been months and nothing has helped. I've pushed away all my friends and family. I am all alone in this cruel world. I have read through hundreds of blogs and sites and have been all over this one. Utterly incapable of happiness- it eludes me and she has moved on. I loved Sara more than the sun, the moon, and the stars. It was pure and honest and more wonderful than anything I could have possibly imagined. She said she loved me to the moon and back. Then she walked out of my life. It's my fault, I pushed and pushed for six weeks. If you love something, let it go. But I held on for dear life. Everytime she thought she made a mistake I acted like a broken-hearted fool. The pain does not lessen. Lonliness increases daily. Everything reminds me. The shame of how I acted is exhilarating. I failed at the most important thing in this world. A life without her is not worth living. When you live in a nightmare, it's written all over your face...

							Hi, I'm 26. I called the local psych hospital, and they said I would need $3500 to admit myself for 3-4 days. I just need to do it. I need to go, get away from the outside world.

					URGENT! A possibly suicidal friend
				","

							My friend who I love very dearly has been struggling for years with depression and self-sabotaging behaviour. She at times drinks too much, and has got into trouble on many occasion. I've watched her go through this for years but for me the final straw came a few weeks ago when she got very drunk at a party, got quite abusive and made several misjudgements, just acted in a way that not her and not acceptable. I didn't speak to her for a week because I wasn't sure what to tell her. I recently sent her a message detailing why exactly I was upset with her and that I was worried about her self-destructive ways and that I wanted to help her get better. Now she has just sent me a message saying how sorry she is that she has ruined everything, and how few up she is with her own behaviour. To be honest her message sounded suicidal. I don't know her address as she's recently moved and I can't get through to her on the phone or email. Who do I contact about this? What do I do? I'm worried sick and would go to her house but I have no idea where it is, and not sure anyone I know does either.

					Lack of hope again?
				","

							Well, A few months ago a girl I was seeing had told me she just wanted to be friends. We were dating for about a year and I took it very hard. I stopped my life. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, I had a vomit bucket in my car cause I would randomly vomit. I was so depressed. The whole time I did go to work. I do sales and this has been very challenging. The stress of making quota and talking to people I've never met and that don't want to talk to me is challenging. I was contemplating suicide. I couldn't go on living with the pain I had been feeling. I started couseling and was referred to a psychiatrist. I have been put on many medications (seroqual, Lemitian(?), and some other anti depressent.) These meds have allowed me to get sleep and start to feel a bit more normal. I still have a lot of pain but it seems to be more managable. I havn't told my friends that I'm on meds for depression. I feel shame in this. I also have been trying to avoid drinking cause I know it only makes things worse. this last weekend I went out both nights with fiends and I lost self contole and drank. They were dinking and I joined them. Yesterday I felt horrible, I was betting myself up for doing this. I was filled with guilt and shame. My mood was low and I was feeling soy fo myself. The weekends are the hardest. this is what I have been doing for the past 10 years with my friends. If I stay in I feel even worse. "

					A reason to live.
				","

							Most nights I would turn off the lights, listen to music, drink a few beers and just think about a good reason to live one more day. For a long time this worked. The reasons I thought of gave me strength and hope. But lately I'm having a hard time finding a good enough reason. For years the part that wanted life always won out against the part of me that wanted death. The light always won over the darkness. But now that light is starting to fade and the darkness is building in strength. I'm loosing the fight that I have fought for so long. But now I'm just tired. So very tired. Most of the time I feel nothing but numb and sometimes I feel fine. And other times I would feel sad, sadness so overwhelming so powerful that I think I'm loosing my mind. "

							Hello all...my names Santino and well I'm new to the forums. That said I hate to dump all this out their but what the hell might as well. I've struggled with depression/anxiety since the ripe old age of 9-10 on a daily basis. I have intense thoughts of suicide/homicide to the point where its crippling. I can't sleep anymore unless i'm physically exhausted.  All I want is to die...I'm sick of life and I think my final days are upon me. I just want to watch the world burn. All day these sick thoughts that i don't even want to get into run through my head.  I've been in and out of psych wards since i was 14. I've cut myself had past suicide attempts so on and so forth. I thought about hanging myself but i'm more of a gun shot to the head type of guy which luckily my dad has one. Well just thought I'd throw that out there. All thats left now is to get my hands on that beautiful little pistol (which is locked up unfortunately but i'll find a way to get it if it kills me...haha) and write up a note.  Guess I'll burn in hell for all eternity its better than this life for sure.    Later

Friends are nonexistent, and my family has nothing to do with me. I have tried to change this- I've tried to make myself a better person, but this only led to people taking advantage of me. I turned to God for help, only to have nothing to show for it. I guess I'm only living for death. "

							Ok, I have decided I just don't want to be here anymore.  I can't kill myself (yet), as that would kill my mom and I would not do that to her.  Thoughout my life (and I am not young), I have thought about ending it all many times.  But I took a vow I would NEVER do that while my parents are still living.  So instead I have opted for a slow form of suicide, which is to say I smoke cigarettes and drink a lot of wine.  "

I used to think that I could perhaps live maybe those 50-60 more years, but as time goes on it just becomes all that much more unbearable.

Last Oct. I tried to kill myself, cut my wrists and taken a bottle of pain killers...dumb me I sent out a mass text message before I took the pills so my friend showed his head in just as I finished drinking my last beer and finishing off the pill bottle. I was extremly angry that I didnt get to finish the job because someone else stopped me.....so here I am again almost a year later. This time I am deployed and no one really seems to care much...so I set a date an it seems like the stress has lifted off my shoulders. I have written my will and ready to transfer all of my money into my loved ones account. Now tell me why I shouldnt go through with it? Do you really think I am going to tell people I want to kill myself after last time I was taken to the local Mental Hospital by police? Held there for 3 weeks? Just because I attempted to kill myself? Well this time I will not be stopped by anyone...got a date set, eill done, finances in order ready to go from this cruel an heartless world. Everyone seems to think that it is ok to sneak around your partner and cheat and this an that. Well im tired of putting my heart on the line in this mordern screwed up world..Goodbye.

							I don't really know where I should start, so I guess I'll just start talking. I'm tired. I'm so tired of fighting with my wife and so tired of working until 3 in the morning every night and I'm starting to worry that my life is never going to amount to anything. I'm a psychology graduate student, so I recognize the classic signs of depression. Even so, I can't help but feel that the only way for me to stop feeling like a completely worthless bastard is to kill myself. I've cut myself in the past (first was accross the wrists, second time was after I learned something of anatomy and cut myself accross the radial arteries), but I realize now that I didn't have the conviction to do it. So fastforward 10 years, I've been married, on drugs, divorced, off drugs, and remarried. I'm now trying to get my doctoral degree, but I can't seem to get my  *  *  *  *  together. Everthing I do seems to turn to  *  *  *  * . My wife criticizes me and says (as of tonight) that I'm worthless and she wonders why she married me. She's probably right in a lot of ways. She works very hard, but she can't understand that just because I do most of my work from home and on the computer, my work is killing me. I'm smart, but I'm having such a hard time keeping my eye on the ""prize."" I don't believe in God, so no help there. My colleagues joke about killing themselves on a daily basis, so I'm sure they see my comments in much the same way - as a joke. I initially thought this would pass, but I find my thoughts drifting more and more to the loaded gun I keep in my closet. Normally, this would be a fairly innocuous fact, but lately it's begun to lurk in my mind like a hateful fly. I know it wouldn't hurt...it would be over in an instant. It seems so easy sometimes, especially since I started drinking heavily. I don't want to hurt anybody or put a guilt-trip on anybody...I just want to stop feeling like this. I've felt this way since I was probably 15 or so, and I'm 30 now. I want it to stop, but I keep thinking that surely things have to start looking up soon. It's so hard though, when even your closest ally accuses you of being no good. I wish my dad was here. He always knew what to say. Thanks for listening, faceless strangers.

							I would like to say, for all of you that make it your job to save someone from suicide, how human of you! You have little resources stopping suicide over the internet, but you do it any way. You take it as your personal job, to let that one person that came here for help, know he is not alone and to guide him back onto his path. When I watch the world around me, I sometimes only see the  negative things around me, but when I come here I see the good, the possibilities.  If someone says there is no more good in the world, remind them of these posts here, let them read the next 1000 posts on this site. This is another great example of how great the human race is and what we could possibly be.  Everyone pulling together and caring more about another human being and giving your time and your support and your advice and your empathy, it makes a difference. I just want to say thank you, I have something to live up to.

I've never been involved with anyone who said such things - nor do I have a lot of experience with depression or other mental-health concerns.

							I need to get away, just drive and take some time to myself. I don't have much money and no family. I was thinking of going to a beach somewhere, but don't know if I can do it. Are there any things I could do to just get away from here and spend some time to myself somewhere? I can't stay at a friend's house because no one has time for me. I need to remove myself from my surroundings and judgmental people and just start new.

				","

							My friend doesn't realize how bad I'm really feeling. I think sometimes, she doesn't know how to be here for me. I'm just not ok right now, and I really need to see her. I haven't seen her in over a week, so it's not like I'm being selfish... I told her I had a really bad night last night, that my mom hurt me bad, and I said I would really like to see her today... I really want to tell her I don't want to live anymore, but I'm not going to. I think it would make me feel better to just see her maybe meet for dinner and have a drink or something. She told me she is at a conference and will text me back... I know she can't read my mind, so I'm trying not to hang on every minute she's not available. I don't want to seem desperate, but I also need to reach out to her and make her realize that I need her right now. How do I tell her I'm scared, that I need her support and that I need her to meet me somewhere? I just need to be with someone right now... I don't want to scare her away... I don't need much, just for her to listen and to be able to be with her for a bit.


"
"
					I'm not sure.
				","

							Well, I don't know if anyone can help.  I've basically wanted to die for over 10 years now.  I can't say that I'm depressed.  I'm pretty happy, really.  I'm 39, I'm dating a model 10 years younger than me.  She's beautiful.  Last year I went around the world, saw so many things.  I've had an incredible life.  Everyone I love is still alive, and cares about me deeply.  No deaths in the family, really.  I was married for 10 years, one of the best in the world in what I do.  Now I'm on disability, so I get paid pretty good money to do whatever I want.  Which I do so many different things.  Socialize, have fun.  I have a huge support system of people who really care about me.  I really care about them too.  Anyway, for the past 10 years or so I've been pushing people away, and at the same time I've been making amends.  I'm pushing my girlfriend away right now.  I pushed my wife away.  I've pushed away the people who love me.  Not outright.  Just by making sure everything is even, clean slate.  Then I make it up in my head that they are all bad people.  Which they aren't.  I accuse them of things they didn't do.  Anyway, I don't think that I'm doing that because I'm crazy.  I think that I'm doing it because I want to die.  Which I do.  Maybe I am crazy.  But, I want to die.  Basically I just don't want to be here anymore.  I don't want any lose ends when I go though.  I guess that I'm just not happy, in my life I've gotten and done everything I've ever wanted to do or get.  I'm still not happy.  I still just want to go away, vanish.   I've tried every psych med out there.  I've had electroshock.  Nothing helps.  I'm not whining, I'm not being a Primadonna.  I just don't want to be here anymore.  I do everything you are supposed to do, it doesn't help.  I've tried everything.  I'm actually getting close to a point now where I could consider everything in order.  I don't know.  I've thought about changing careers, doing something else.  I've tried a lot of different things.  Maybe being a musician?  I'm horrible at that, maybe it would be a challenge?  I don't know.  I'm not really sure.  I've been trying so many things.  I still am not happy.  I think that 'not happy'  really isn't the description I'm looking for, because that implies sad.  I just don't see any reason to stay around.  Maybe I am sad right this minute, but most of the time I'm not.  Still, always, I'm on track for sewing things up and keeping things even.  I guess that inside I'm always sad.  I just don't know why.  Maybe I'm just paranoid delusional.  Maybe thats whats making me sad.  I don't think so though.  I think that I'm keeping everyone away because I want to die.  I'm so confused.  I've been to so many doctors, on so many medications.  Nothing helps.

"
					Reasoning and Method?
				","

							I feel like there are many reasons why I should kill myself. First off, and most importantly, I am in an insane amount of debt that I will probably not be able to pay off for a really long time. The main thing that bothers me about this is that I haven’t enjoyed my life for the most part for the last 10 years, yet I’m going to be paying for all the  *  *  *  *  I did for the next 20. It doesn’t feel worth it to me. Secondly, while I know Aaron(my boyfriend) loves me, I feel as if I am a burden upon him. I am always depressed and have a hard time enjoying myself  doing anything. He was right when he said I will probably never be happy. And all the more reason I need to stop bringing him down. I wish I could talk to him about how empty I feel but every time I do I get the same “I’m going to break up with you if you don’t cut this  *  *  *  *  out” speech. So now I’m scared to say anything for fear I will loose him, the only thing in my life that I have left. But for the most part it is excruciating to deal with these feelings. I have trouble sleeping every night and I usually get up and cry in the other room so Aaron doesn’t hear me. I know that I cry too much, but I feel so depressed. He basically thinks that I just cry to get attention and to make myself look like a victim. I’m not a victim, I’m just not a worthwhile person. I have spent many years trying to find ways to be ok with myself, yet I’m still worthless to me and everyone who knows me. Which is very few people. The only person I have a real relationship with is Aaron, and the rest of my family I have absolutely no emotional connection to and just visit them out of obligation, as I’m sure they do the same.  I used to think, well at least I’m decent looking, but now I’m just a fat ugly woman. I’ve gained 70lbs since I stopped taking Ritalin and I feel so discouraged that I will never have a normal body again. I used to love sex but now I feel so fat an unattractive that I have a hard time enjoying myself while doing it. I have to imagine myself as someone pretty and desirable. Since I just learned that if I die, student loan debt does not transfer to the next of kin, I have nothing really stopping me from killing myself. Of course there are issues with doing so. First off, how to do it. I’ve tried drugs and they don’t work, I just end up sick and look stupid. Cutting myself obviously doesn’t work since I sliced my hand in half and I still didn’t die. I’m thinking of gassing myself in my car in the garage. I wish I had a gun, that would make the choice easy. And I also don’t want to do it in Aaron’s condo. That would be extremely rude and selfish of me. If I do it, I should just leave here and Aaron could just think that I ran away or something so he wouldn’t have to know I killed myself. I really don’t want to hurt him and that is the hardest thing for me, but I know he’s right, I just  *  *  *  *  on his good moods, I drag him down and I am insensitive to his needs because I am so absorbed in myself because of my loathing and self hatred. I’m going to think about it some more and hopefully I can come up with a plan by the end of this month. If I don’t get a job soon, I’m going to have to kill myself. It’s my only choice. And don’t try to tell me to go get help. I only have $30 to my name, 140K in debt and bills that have piled up for months, and I haven’t had health insurance in over a year. I can’t afford it and I am not going into some inpatient thing. They don’t listen to you, they hold you involuntarily, they just try to shove pills on you (and not even the ones I want) and send your way with a nice 7k bill to follow. I am merely posting this to see if anyone else has some good ideas on how to kill yourself.

				","

							I'm writing this because I guess I'm just tired of keeping it to myself and I want to see what people think of it, and what better audience is there than the internet? If you haven't figured it out yet, I'm talking about killing myself. I'm not some melodramatic kid who's pissed off at the world, I just don't see the point in going on anymore. Everyday I wake up tired and have to pull myself out of bed to start a pointless day that always ends with me wondering why I haven't grown the balls to finally pull the trigger on myself. I have no friends anymore and I live with my parents who I know love me, but frankly expect me to be this prodigal son who's great at everything. I'm going to a community college and I'm failing two of the four classes I'm taking, I don't have a job, the only girl I ever really liked as an adult treats me like I'm an object for her amusement, and I'm finding it harder and harder to even pretend like I'm normal for the sake of the people around me. Some prodigal son right? I'm not sure when I started feeling like this, but I know that I just don't feel anything anymore except for depression and rage. It's like everything that made me happy just doesn't anymore, I don't have anything to live for. I tried killing myself once before, but due to a weird computer glitch my suicide note didn't go out and I didn't want to just vanish on my family. Divine intervention? Or maybe satan just wants to screw with me for a while longer. Or maybe it was really just a glitch. I used to cry when I thought about killing myself, but now the idea of it energizes me because at least I'm taking a step in a direction, even if many think it's the wrong way. I would have tried again sooner, but awhile ago my dad's best friend killed himself and I couldn't have gone through with it so close to that. I sincerely hope there is not a god, because if there is and it tried to teach me something about suicide by making my dad's friend kill himself or at the very least allowing it, then that's not a god I would want to be a part of, I'd rather burn. Even though I have plenty of problems with my folks, I love them and I don't want to hurt them, but I'm just hurting them by staying around here and I can't take their demands of me anymore. I'm a loser, and it would just be better if I went away forever. If anyone has any suggestions on how to leave them without it killing them, please post away. If you somehow feel compeled to try and save me by telling me that I'm worth something and that it'll get better soon, don't bother posting.

I have nothing to look forward to when I wake up. Really dont. Sometimes, in the back of my mind I think that i'm better of being dead then alive and I dont even know why I'm here anymore when i'm better of being dead then still hanging around. Still dont understand the reason. Why am I still here.  To a point I really dont care who I hurt and who I dont. I've been hurt to many times to care about who or who I dont hurt. "

I'm back where I started...which is nowhere. Sure I went to school, got a 4 year degree, worked for a finance company.. yada yada...but now I'm back home with my parents, working for our small family business--a bakery shop...exactly the same thing I did 15 years ago! Nothing has changed....except I wasted alot of years...    And then after many heart breaks...I thought I finally found ""the one""!   I really felt like God was finally blessing me with a good man and a good relationship...We dated for almost 2 years...mostly good memories...and then he recently broke up with me and said that he doesn't see himself married to me. OUch! In my drunken state, I've always been tempted to swallow two full bottles of sleeping pills. But I'm so scared about where my spirit would go in the afterlife that I stop myself. Its funny cus I'm usually the ones to tell people NOT to commit suicide...but how can I help others when I cannot even help myself? I don't know what to do anymore.

							So this is my story.I am 18 years old,in highschool(I'm a guy),I always thought about suicide,and I still am.I haven't done it yet because I am afraid to kill myself,but from what I read on diferent forums,I saw people saying stuff like suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem,etc.Now here is why I believe that you are wrong(in some cases at least).I have been a fat kid all my life,not too fat,I mean I can still walk,run,and stuff like that.Just that I'm fat.When i was a litle boy I was bullied by others that made me lose all my self-confidence(not bullied like what you see in the movies,but since i am sensible by nature,I put it to my heart quicly).During high-school i wasnt bullied,but this doesnt mean that the others like me.I am just an outsider with no friends and no one likes me.Never had a gf,never had sex,hell,i cant even socialize properly."

							You experience lows that feel like you have actually kept going way past rock bottom. Then things get better for a while. But all the time you live in fear of the lows coming back. Then they do and you realise that the highs account fir such a tiny part of the whole that it could be the longest time before they come round again."

							first time here. been depressed over 30 years every day is hell. Last dec. tried co2 but failed. close but ended up with two surgerys to fix my arm. Only person really knows what happened is my wife. When i left to kill myself she was crying and said goodby but not once stop or dont do it. After second surgery i knew i had a couple of months to heal so i thought last chance to get help. would have no pressure from work or responsibiltys. At first could not find a therapyst. I have been to a few that did no good so i wanted a good one. Good ones are booked. I found one an hour away from home but  it took two months to find her and get a time slot. I went to about six sessions. Because of the drive i could only go once a week so we did a hour and a half session. $300.00 a session money i do not have. She is good but a day or two after i would be right back were i started so each session was like starting over. The only way is twice a week. Now back at work and deep in dept from three months off of work i can not take off two days a week or even come close to paying over $400 a week plus the meds she says i need and the  $200 a month for that doctor. I hate my job and the stress is bad and work is slow not making a living wage if it picks up the stress will double. Not the enviromnet to get over depression. A month ago i took a drive to the hills to kill myself, gun this time no more failed attempts, but i did not do it. I called the suicide hot line what a joke that was. Problem is i have a 12 year old daughter and i dont want to do this to her. We dont talk much havent for a while i isolate myself from them but i know it wont be good for her. I am at the point again were death is the lesser of two evils. I can not afford help and i can not do it on my own. This is my last effort for a different plan any advice? I am going to kill myself on tuesday

							I just really hope the people that read this arent the type of people who think im just saying that without actually doing things to help myself. Im just so sick of being suicidal after all this time and it not gettin better. Im just a complainer and a loner and that doesnt help. I dont even like calling myself stuff like that but what else can i do. Ive done everything that you could possibly do to stop yourself from killing yourself and I still end up right here like its nothing. I cant help myself when i get like this so im supposed to get help from others but you cant depend on anyone. I really just dont get it because it makes no sense. Its like people around you are supposed to help you do good in life if thats what your trying to do but what if you dont have those type of people in your life. I dont even know if i would have anyone in my life right now as it is because its a f-ing mess."

							These past few months have been beyond rough. There's this ongoing, constant custody battle with my parents over me right now. Only my mom is just trying to get me over at her house so she can have a larger tax refund and more child support. I don't want to be there at all because Her husband is a controlling, abusive smoker who manipulates and mooches off off people and he has absolutely no morals. On top of that, my dad thinks I'm old and mature enough to handle hearing about what really went on during my parents' divorce 10 years ago. "

							It seems like the only thing holding me together is being manic. I dont see anything in my life that would give me hope. I basically live only to deal with more pain over and over again. Its like im fighting myself to be positive and am losing really bad. I sometimes fantasize about killing myself just to get away from the pain because i wont do it. Its like how much worse is my life going to get. I constantly feel like a victim because even when im doing everything I can even if its alittle things dont work out for me. My life is constantly about things going wrong and having to deal with them. Of course I have no choice in things going wrong because im not in control of everything. "

					Tired of fighting a losing battle
				","

							Decided that I have had enough and will end it soon. Frustrated with always ending up at the same place - knee deep in crap and no way to get out. No matter what I do the depression and suicidal ideation always seems to hit. I have tried everything (therapy with and without meds, talking to friends, you name it) and no matter what I do I end up in the same place. I know that no one will miss me when I go. I am a wasted, used up excuse for a life. I am so tired of being torn in many directions and only being used for what I can do for the people in my life and not one of them wondering if they can do something for me. I am tired of living so that others won't be lonely. In my opinion that is a stupid reason for staying alive and in crippling pain. If my family truly loves me then they will be glad I am not in pain anymore. Right now I am so angry and frustrated. I wish I could end it tonight. But as soon as I get what I need then I am gone. I just need someone to talk to to keep me from killing them before I kill myself. Thanks

							I left my job on a friends advice to go to another job.  She is now an ex friend.  I know it was my decision but she know at the time I was devistated because my ex put me out of our home then moved his ex in and his family.  This girl was so by my side thru everything.  The new job didnt work out I lost it.  I was doing something I liked before and had perfect attendance.  They will not rehire me because I left without notice.  The big boss was considering it because I was a good worker but never got back with me.  The h.r. person sent me a letter when I reapplied that they are going with more qualified applicants.  Funny I was qualified enough to get the job.  But I have tried to get back on my job.  I know its my fault but what hurts so much is that the person who gave me the advice while I was down, depressed and couldnt deal with reality of my ex putting me out of our home after 7 years, she sat and gave me advice and know I was not in any position to be making any major decisions.  Well I lost my job, became homeless and all she could say to me was, well you didnt want that job anyway.  I told her I should not have taken her advice when I was in such a fragil state.  All she could say is I dont know what your talking about.  Its like she hated to see me getting ahead.  She is the kind of person who wants someone to take care of her, I want to work.  I was there for her to see her get back on her feet and get a place to stay, she told me if I was losing my place as long as I have family I have a place to stay, I didnt want to stay with her."

							I've loved this girl for 2 and a half years. I don't find myself even slightly attracted to any other girls. I don't even remember seeing other females in a sexual way. I love her and I could go on and on about how compatible our personalities are. We were best friends for several years, the kind who talk for hours and hours like daily, and she would often act in a way that suggested mutual interest, everyone who saw us just naturally assumed we were together. However a year and a half ago she got a boyfriend and i fell into deep depression, and ended up admitting my love for her which really  *  *  *  * ed things up. they broke up in that spring so in the summer i said i was over her to everyone, so we have become close friends again. But she and him got back together this winter, and i know i should be happy for her if she is in love with another guy, but she has admitted that she knows he's not quite right for her, and that she has not truly fallen for him, but she just can't have those feelings for me, since she has always seen me as her friend and not in a sexual way. I have tried to get over her for years, but i love everything about her and cannot seem to do it. I have tried everything, seen psychologists, and doctors, done drugs, seperated myself completely with no contact for several months, and tried everything the internet has suggested.  I can hardly stand the fact that they talk, or hold hands. Let alone what goes on in her bedroom. He still hasn't taken her virginity, but i would instantly kill myself if he did. What do i do. I can't get over her. and No one else can possibly compare to her. and I will always love her, and always be alone,so whats the point of life. "

Like I'll be on the phone and that person has to go, or I'll drop my pencil, or even having a knife in my sight...  And sometimes It would be nothing at all. But then in an hour or so I'll be completely back to 'normal' and be thinking to my self ""where did that come from?"" And I cannot help but  pay attention those feelings; they are so intense and killing myself and self injury seems so clearly defined and makes total sense and nothing can stop me... And when I'm in my 'regular' state of mind, Ill be thinking ""Life and the world and how everything somehow 'fits' together, it's just way too damn interesting to not be a part of it, or at least try figuring it out."""

I think of all these ways to try to make myself feel better, even faking happiness like I did before, but in the end I'm stuck being miserable. Everyone who I was once friends with real life and on the net has abandoned me at my lowest. I just want to die so badly, yet I can't seem to do it and I don't understand.

							For months now, I haven't been able to sleep through the night. I'm constantly waking up over 15 times in only 4-5 hours.  My mind is constantly running. It doesn't matter what I do that day, if I'm busy or relaxed; I just can't stay asleep. I've been married for almost 5 years now and lately I haven't felt the same about him like I did before. I know he's there and he tells me he loves me all the time but I don't FEEL it. Lately I feel like he is merely a roommate. When we have sex, I feel disconnected and sometimes like there isn't anything there."

					Headed down the wrong path

							I am not sure there is a way to salvage my life.  While not actively suicidal, I did ask my friend for his gun last week.  I told him that I needed one for self-protection.  In his infinite wisdom, he saw through my ploy and told me he'd never be able to live with himself if I were to use it against myself.  Still, I see me trying to get one someday and doing just that.

							living is agony yet the thought of death fills my retched soul with fear. death is not the solution. i wish to not exist. "
,"

							Well I never usually open up about deep problems, but today I truly realized I have some pretty bad issues. I'm in the military and in the past month 4 soldiers committed suicide in my state. So today I had to take a briefing on suicide prevention. The thought of suicide has never entered my mind but the briefing did make clear to me that I am brutally depressed. When I was younger I was socially awkward and still am when I am not around my friends. I've abused substances since I was 14 and I am now 21 and binge drink every weekend. I've had a close friend die in the past few years and I saw his death turn into a social event for the town/highschool. I've been in a extremely dysfunctional and violent relationship for 3 years of my life but I've moved on from her. I literally saw this girl slash her wrists in front of me and say ""this is all your fault."" I fell in love again and I'm not over it. I also cheated on that girl when I was drunk, that wasn't the reason for the breakup because she never found out. I think I've cheated on almost every girlfriend that I've ever had. I've seen very dark  <>  . From women getting abused to guys shooting up and smoking crack. I've seen my best friends dad turn from a proud normal guy, to crack addict, to basically a brain dead shell of a man. I just found out tonight my friend plays with the idea of killing himself frequently. I had a long discussion with him today about why he should try to make his life better and get passed this  <>   and when he said ""whats the point of this  <> rat race of life"" I really couldn't answer. I'm gaining weight. I have more money than I ever have had, a brand new car, basically a bunch of nice  <>  . I'm no happier than when I was broke and poppin ecstasy every night. I just have tooooooo much  <>  ing stress and I'm surrounded by negative  <>  . My family is good though. I'm a full time student and work full time. I have my first deployment to Afghanistan coming up in the next year. I know I should seek help but I don't have the time for appointments and all that BS. Eh,  <>   it, its good to vent anyways.

							Cast out unto the world without direction, we look for a wind to guide us through life. For most, their sails give them the force to go through life. Sure, there may be adversities to overcome, but there is always a wind pushing them through life, giving them the motivation to look for hope in tomorrow. Their hopes to some day be a teacher, a parent, rich, or happy give them the enegy to push through the tides that try to push them back. "

					I Think i need help

							I await the day I die. I sometimes think about taking my car off the road to end it all. I have already had accidents, but have only injured myself. everyday, i think of other easier ways to die. I know its selfish, i know i shouldn't. but i have had enough. I try to speed the life process more and more by drinking and smoking excessively and taking any drug i can get my hands on. last time i was in one of those moods i heard that 30 panadol are possibly lethal. I took 47, not to mention the other tabs i got my hands on... antibiotics, pure codiene, anything that had something in it. I felt incredibly sick for weeks. And got me depressed that it didn't work. I try to help people with their problems, but no one seems to think about me. i feel worthless, useless, just a waste of skin. I don't want this life anymore. thankfully i believe in reincarnation. So death doesn't worry me. I'm scared i may do something drastic soon. I'm too stubborn to see a psychiatrist. I dont open up to anyone, as i just feel like i am weighing them down with my problems.

					But, I am alone
				","

							What other way to start off this topic with, I hate my life. I'm worthless! Everything that could possibly go wrong happens to me. i have no best friends to turn to, my girlfriend just broke up with me today, i have nowhere to turn, nothing to look forward to. Every single day i think of ways to kill myself. or just an escape. ive starred at my car multiple times, wondering if i just drove off, and never came back.. what would happen. As i type this im starring at a full bottle of pills, and i'm holding myself by a thread from grabbing that bottle and trying to OD. Nothing goes right for me. ive been depressed for idk how long. im a paranoid person about everything, im jealous over everything, i hate all the painful crap i deal with day after day. there has never been a perfect day.  I dont want to tell my mom i want to see a psychiatrist, because i know she'll flip and try and nurse me, which i dont want at all. Theres nobody that could help me. nobody that could drive me to a psychiatrist, nobody that could help. I don't believe in god. i don't believe in reincarnation, and thats another reason holding me from death. what will happen? is it just... black? a dark hole forever? do i just never think again? There has to be something. "

					Why not
				","

							I am thinking of ending my existence. Why do I say existence because what I have is not a life but just that. I have been unemployed since August have no money and even though I go and apply, send resumes, etc etc , I get nothing not even a call. I am 47 yrs old never been married still single after many failed relationships, with the last attempt of establishing one ending at the beginning of December. I feel flawed like nobody cares, my family appears to not give a  *  *  *  *  as they all have jobs are married and well their lives are just grand. If I dont get a job within the month I will be on the streets, I have given up hope that will happen and have begun planning my demise. I just want to go to the mountains and sit by the most beautiful tree I can find and freeze to death with the beauty of nature being my last thing seen on this planet. I know people say think of all the people you will hurt. Well just once I would like them to see how I hurt and show a little compassion. It just seems like I am on the outside loking in and no one cares. I mean lets face it me leaving here wont leave a mark just as my life hasn't so whats the difference. I just don't trust anymore nor believe in what I see in this world, it is a selfish place and ruthless and I see no hope of that ever changing.

I HATE THIS!!! People die everyday from all sorts of things. Good people with great dreams and aspirations, so why do they die and I live? I don't ""appreciate"" life, so why do I have to live. I want so badly for someone to just end me. At this point, I'm really just thinking about how I can do this comfortably. I don't know.

					Lowest point in my life

							I've officially hit the lowest point in my life. I am constantly googling suicide on my phone whereas before I was googling how to get someone back. I am a student and my state of mind and mental health are affecting it big time. I could easily be getting 90's however I am just simply doing enough to get by.  I dont know where to turn these days as my friends are the most judgemental people on the earth and any sign of emotion being showed is a sign of weakness, females and males. I am in a whirlwind of financial trouble and in total need about 10,000 dollars to get me on my feet again. I try to tell myself to be good at everything I do, including school and that will make me more attractive to her but everyday I dont hear from her I get very discouraged and just add everything together and realize its not worth living my life anymore. I have been going to the gym, and remain seeing friends but its just emptiness everywhere I go. If there were a pill that killed me instantly I would take it. Its just suicide is so hard to do, I just know my body would fight it and I dont feel like putting my body through that. I just can't take the emotional pain and numbness and knowing I lost the girl of my dreams. I have been considering asking her out again as the communication lines are open mostly due to my efforts and I plan to Friday. If I get a response that hurts, im not sure what I am going to do to myself. The easiest method I have come accross is hanging myself. I appreciate everyone who provides support to people like myself and others. I just feel so empty sometimes no matter where I go, I can barely watch TV and I cry everyday. It has just been a downward spiral since the girl of my dreams I was seeing for 4 months left me in June. I feel so low in my life right now that I feel and fear I am too deep to even try to get better and back on track and feel suicide is the only option because I cannot feel like this any longer. I refuse to."

					Suicide Addiction: A real disease?

							I've read so many expressions of suicidal thought, here and elsewhere, and have yet to find anyone who seems to share my experience with thoughts of ending life.  In each instance, the suffer expresses (overtly or by obvious impression) the need to end his or her life as an escape from pain.  Suffering, whether physical, emotional, or spiritual seems to produce in them an active drive to seek refuge from that pain by the extreme and desperate step of suicide.  This is not my experience."

							I'm posting here mainly because I want an outlet where I can rant. I've just been thinking of suicide so often recently. I'm just tired of this life. What's the point? I don't enjoy life, so isn't death a better option than a life of drudgery? I basically have no social life, no social skills, nothing to live for, nothing to look forward to, nothing that would motivate me to live another day. Having to post this on an anonymous forum means that I have no one I can talk to about this. And I know that most of you can relate, having no one at all in your life who you could trust enough to talk to about things like this. I go to college far away from home, and this loneliness that I'm feeling just won't go away. I'm already a junior in college, but I honestly I can count the number of ""friends"" I have on one hand. I feel little to no interest in my coursework, and feeling so often interferes heavily with my grades. I feel like a failure, like I'm not smart enough, like I don't belong here, or anywhere for that matter. Every morning I dread having to get up and face the world alone, following the same routine day after day, and knowing that life will just be a series of pointless motions. I want it to get better, but sometimes, I feel like I would be more useful buried under the ground. Having said all of this though, I honestly don't think I can go through with suicide. I fantasize about it a lot, though, wondering how pleasant it would be to just be done with this all. I've never been in a relationship, I know I can never find anyone, I have no friends, no motivation, I'm unlikeable, I'm a failure, etc. I know I should probably go to university counseling or something, but that would probably make me feel like more of a failure...."

							I'm feeling bad lately, suicide is something I think about a lot but I doubt I'll ever do it. having a really hard time acting happy...I feel like my friends are going to give up on me any day now and not want to be around me because of it, I'm not really sure why I have friends and why they like me in the first place. I know they will all be married soon and I will be left alone anyway. I do have good family and they would do a lot for me, but I've always pushed them away and wanted to get away from them since I was born and dont know why. they remind me of myself and make me hate myself even more I think. since my last girlfriend 4-5 years ago, I don't think any girl has liked me more than in a friendly way and I'm 27 now. about a year ago I started taking some pain killers, stopped going out, since then I stopped taking them and only like going to strip clubs to see girls without the reality of rejection, the looks that a girl can give when she wants nothing to do with you just kills so much. looking in the mirror really hurts and I just wish I wasnt me anymore. I dont want to live but I dont want to die, I'm just living and going through motions and I dont know why. I think theres a possibility of hope for me if I work on myself and become a confident person like I have been for short times in my past. I don't know if I can get there before I get worse and hate myself even more and cant get out

							The reason intelligent design is not scientific is because there is no evidence for it whatsoever. You see - in science we don't begin with conclusion and thereafter try to search for evidence to support those conclusions. Rather, we begin by observing the world and performing experiments. Only then do we pose hypotheses based on those observations or experiments. After conclusions are reached, the rest of the scientific community actively tries to disprove those conclusions, rather than reinforce them. When faced with a question we cannot answer, there is no generic fill-in-the-blank response such as ""God did it."" "

							I have just gotten over my last attempt. 67 staples later I am still here. Why? I cannot see the need for me and now I feel like a disaster. I try playing golf getting out but that only helps for a small amount of time. Doctors say there is nothing wrong with me and that I am a sensible person. Well this may be the case in their world but that is certainly not mine. After having a look around the net all i could find is support. That in its self is a problem but when you or I as it is in this case just want to talk about it with the ultimate conclusion that this will happen there is nobody that can say anything. Nobody talks about it really and this drives me crazy. Public liability dictates that you cannot do this so where is the support so many people need. I understand that there are some of you who have thought about it and changed your mind and that's cool good for you, however there are people out here that will continue until it is done and all that i am saying well this is my choice and not anyone else's. The laws of the land change all the time. In some cultures its a part of their customs in others its against the law and in some its a sin, but what is more wrong failing to do it or just have a drink get depressed and drive. Society expects but i dont i do my bit but really im just killing time. To all of you out there with those thoughts seek advice honestly it will help, you dont want to try and fail and end up parilised.

					Should I call the police, his parents or a suicide hotline?

							It's not the first time I'm posting here about this, and I'm at the same point I was back where I wrote here about it."
,"

							I've been through/ am going through cutting and suicide attempts and constant thoughts about dying for the past few years and i've come to a sort of conclusion. If we could find just one thing to hold on to. One thing that makes us happy, or a goal. things may start to look up. And I guess if I've stopped cutting  before, I could stop again, maybe even for longer. Or maybe all together. I've come to the conclusion that it really doesn't solve anything. In a way it only makes things worse and more complicated. All it does is provide a temporary relief to long term problems. So why did I/we even start in the first place? To escape our problems, yes.... but why did we chose to mutilate ourselves instead of working through our problems and being productive? I still cant figure out what is really wrong with it. I know what other people and therapists have told me, but I haven't found anything wrong with it personally. And I'm still trying to figure out why people can't just accept people who cut into society. Since we already feel rejected, wouldn't it make sense if people just put aside their prejudices and made us feel wanted? Even though I know we do not live in a fair world, by no streach of the imagination, and it would be naive to think that. But really, how hard would it be to just accept us? And although I still haven't found a reason or a will to live, I'm holding onto the fact that there may be something I've missed. And that maybe I'm only 95% sure I really do not want to live. And maybe there is a reason somewhere in that 5%. So even if I'm thinking that there's no point and we all live to die, and maybe thats true, but if I'm wrong I may not want to take that chance. I'm just looking for a reason. or anything.

							I can't help feeling absolutely ridiculous as I write this. Not that I think anyone else who publicly seeks help for suicidal thoughts, online or elsewhere, is ridiculous. I'll just get on with it. I'm seventeen years old, soon to be eighteen. Most of my life I've been forced to deal with OCD, ADHD, terrible anxiety, and the ever-present depression. Many times I've been sent flying to the brink where I suspend myself for as long as I can brave to before reeling in my cowardly body. I have smoked pot for less than a year now and my parents strongly disapprove. They used to be lenient when it came to discipline, but when they discovered I had tried pot a few time they wigged out and sent me to a behavioral and mental school for the end of my junior year. I continued to smoke occasionally, if they ever found out I'd be grounded for about a month. This time, they found out I smoked, took away my car and phone ""permanently"" and are ordering me to quit my new job that brings me so much unexpected joy. I wanted to at least buy my own car to get myself to work and have my sister drive me there until I can do so, but they won't allow. I asked my dad why I'm even still living at this house and he said he didn't know, and that I should just find somewhere else to go then. I know they don't actually want me to leave, and I certainly don't want to, but what am I to do? So, needless to say, all I can ponder is death at the moment. I want to kill myself, but when I attempted, I only made it so far before I got scared and backed out. I want to die so badly! So  <> badly! I am so alone. No one else will take care of me and I definitely can't take care of myself. It's too late for me to change the past and no one will believe a word I say if it mentions promises of change in myself for the future. What can I possibly do?

I hate TV, it's all propaganda and stupid stereotypes and the same boring things over and over. I hate the winter where I live its 8 months long, I hate churches because all they do is brainwash you, I hate people in general because they will absolutely destroy you and backstab you to the fullest extent they can just to gain ANYTHING from it. I have been nice to everyone around me, maybe too nice, I try to go out and do things and make new friends, but it's never a success. I'm convinced I look ugly or weird or something because nobody seems to want anything to do with me ever. I am too depressed to move anymore I barely ate anything or got out of bed saturday-monday, not even sure if I really want to go to class tomorrow.

No hope. A year ago, I had most of those things and hope for those I lacked, but I saw the fall coming and tried to get out before it came. No I live in the nightmare I tried to avoid. The one everyone said I was mistaken about. I realize now, that no one will ever say, ""You're right. Your life is hopeless and death is the best thing for you."" It'll never be said. I couldn't ever imagine saying it myself, even if someone told me my life's story as though it were there own. We have to decide about self-deliverance on our own.

					I don't know where to turn.
				","

							I do not know where to turn anymore, life is just full of empty motions, devoid of anything worth while. I do not offer anything to the world all I do is bring everyone around me down. I have no friends. No connection with my family. (I have a physical connection, but no mental) I find myself in a vacuous state all the time. Most of the time I am unsure of my own emotions. And my one true passion; music, is starting to disinterest me. All of it is beginning to sound the same. I have no talents, I am anti-social, and there is unquestionably no one who will ever even begin to understand me. Including myself. If I were to kill myself, no one would really miss me. They'd probably grieve the appropriate amount of time that is expected, and go back to their normal mindless daily routine. The only thing holding me back is the unknown. Where will I go when I die? As I do not believe in religion (it only creates another reason for war) or god ( a myth made up for man to understand what they cannot) I cannot be completely sure of anything. But where ever it is, it has to be better than this. I just don't know how much longer I can take pretending nothing is wrong. I don't know how much more I can take pretending I actually give a damn about anything. But the truth is; I'm scared. And as much as I don't want to live, I don't want to make a wrong decision and screw myself over. But Im sick of not caring, I'm sick of people, I'm sick of society, I'm sick of life and most of all; I'm sick of myself. I wish I didn't feel like this all the time. I wish I could lead my life like everyone else my age. I wish I were shallow. And I think suicide is the only thing to take my pain away. People tell me I should, so why not? I'm just a  burden to everyone around me anyways. It's not worth all the trouble of trying. I'm just going to end it. Please do not feel like you need to respond. I'm not worth your time. Goodbye.

							Ive spent the whole day being so angry that I cant deal with anything. I cant really do anything because all my issues ruin everything. Its just most of the time Im so mad at how everything is that in the end it doesnt matter. I know i cant do anything besides just deal with it because nothing makes this better. Im living a life to survive and thats it. I cant get any joy or feel good about anything because something happens and just ruins it. Its like just me talking about my life is depressing so people just because of that wont say anything. Its like all these dead ends that dont lead anywhere. Im supposed to live my life and just deal with whatever happens but how do you do that when your life is unbearable."

					Stevie Wonder
				","

							I was listening to some Stevie Wonder music. I love his music. His music has so much personality, feeling, and happyness. He was blind from birth almost. It makes me sad to think about that. He's such a wonderful musician and I'm sure he's a great guy too, but he's blind. I wish so much that he could have the ability to see all the beauty in the world. Then I realized he sees beauty. He creates beauty. He was dealt crappy cards, and he still has such soul and life. For those of you cnsidering ending your life, reconsider. Life is worth living. Even if you've been blinded to the beauty in the world, you can create beauty. You can feel the beauty. If a problem feels unbearable, if you can't deal with it, then don't. Run away. Find a happy lace and live your life there. ind a way to be happy. Find someone to comfort you. There are many people here. I'm here. I care. Trust me. Live. Connect with someone, something, anything. There are worse places to be, and there are better places. Go to a better place. Listen to some Stevie Wonder. Think about what I've said.

					I'm already dead inside. Whats the difference?
				","

							I feel so empty. I'm past the point of depression. im at the point where i just dont care about anything anymore.Not about my friends, family nothing. They've all F***ed me over at some point or another. I dont know what its like to be happy. Since i was 11 years old i battled suicidal idealation. What i had to go through growing up is something no one should have to go through. Molestation, Losing family members to drugs and booze. The abandoment. Ive struggled with Self-mulilation for god knows how long. I have nothing left. no more energy to deal anything else. i cant. and i wont. ive had enough. i thought i had found one person who understood me. and thats over now too. hes now sleeping with the person who i thought was my best friend, after him and i were together for 2 and a half years. But no. No one gets me. My thought process is far from normal. Bipolar since i was 16. in and out of the mental hospital. And just recently was released for attempted suicide by OD. I cant trust anyone. i cant open up to anyone. the one person i cared about now says no one will miss me when im 6 feet in the ground. and it would have been better if i had never been born. All my hopes and dreams will mean nothing to the maggots and worms eating away at my cold dead flesh. I just cant do it anymore. Everytime i trust someone i am let down . The F*** me over in the long run. I have a wall built inside my head that no one will ever get through. I bottle things up so long that i end up exploding and hacking a chunk of skin out of my leg or arm. just to feel something. i just recently talked to my friend pat, and i think he understands to an extent which is why he knows and accepts that i will take my own life someday. whether its today or in 10 years. im sick of gving myself to people. and letting them in so they can hurt me. thats all ive ever known was let down and hurt. My whole family knows what ive had to battle with. they dont understand, but i do know they expect me to crack one of these days and take myself out of this god forsaken earth we live on. It should be my right to take my own life. everyone says, ""oh its selfish"" isnt it more selfish of someone trying to stop me and making me endure the pain, suffering and torment that i have to go through every day of my pathetic miniscule and worthless life? They dont have the memories, they dont have the emotional instability... they dont know what its like to walk in my shoes. no one should anyway. its torment. when you arent welcome in your familys homes, and you have a dead end job. you cant hold one for your life, it drives you insane. maybe its not enough self discipkine or maybe its the lack of concern for your well being. whatever. ill just overdose on sleeping pills and call it a life.

				","

							First of all I'd like to say that I've read posts on here and that a lot of you have great things to say regarding this subject. Thank you for your thoughts, as I can see them definitely helping some people out there. I've been battling major depression for at least 10 years now, maybe longer. And though I can see the value of what some of you have to say, I have a hard time applying it to my specific situation. I realize I would be hurting people by choosing to remove myself from this planet. One thing that I'm trying to make sense of though, is when I should stop caring. These same people I would be affecting have played a large role in why I feel the way I feel. I seem to be a complete failure, no matter what I attempt. I don't believe my existence benefits society for any reason at all. I have come to the conclusion that the world has passed me by and will just keep on going. I do not feel like I can relate to anyone, yet I still try, with a small shred of hope, to make a connection(such as starting this thread). I've been alive for about 1/3rd of my lifespan and I am sick to death of how things go on. It seems to me that hurtful things happen to good people without much rhyme or reason to explain them. It seems like royal a**h***s have the best of luck at anything they do. Is this purely an issue of confidence? I think not. I believe it's more of an issue of greed and selfishness. Am I being selfish for believing I don't belong here? I don't think so. I've looked at the problem rather logically: 1.I am a burden of one type or another on a lot of people. 2. I don't like it here. 3. With a lot of patience, medications, and talk over the years, I have come to the same conclusion, based upon a lack of being able to find a suitable compromise. Was I just born to be the world's doormat? Am I not allowed to make mistakes, but must absolutely and immediately be understanding of others' mistakes? As I mentioned before, there is still that shred of hope that I can figure all of this out. But for now, it is as my thread title says, I feel like I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't.

					I'll kill myself - damn lonely
				","

							I think I will end my torments. Permanently. But I think there needs to be some explanation. Some do it because they broke up with someone, others do it because they are laughed at, some after loss of loved one or out of loneliness... But none of those reasons fit in with me. If someone was to laugh at me I'd probably rip out his intestines and feed them to him. I'm 6'2'' with 220 pounds of muscles. But not fat by any account. I'm not lonely either. I'm a dancer and as such have met scores of other people, most of which call me their friend. I don't drink or smoke or do drugs. My friends love me and I'm extremely successful in most things I do. Why would I then want to kill myself you ask? Because of love... Or more precisely lack of it. For as long as I remember I wanted one thing, and one thing only. A girlfriend who would love me. Who I would be happy with. And I never got it. I would give world for such a girl. She would be secure in every way. Physical, emotional, economical... But nothing helps... Every time I grew fond of some girl she would tell me that she only wants us to be friends. Nothing more. I heard that one so many times that I lost count. Not to say that I didn't have girlfriends... I did. A lot. But... It was because I felt a duty not to hurt or disappoint any girl that liked me. I even tried liking them... But to no avail... Once I was in love with this girl and was trying to win her over for like 4 months. She told me she just wanted to be friends... It was two years ago and she's still my friend. I'm to loyal for my own good. Does any one of you know how hard it is to be friend to someone you love and see them with other people and KNOW that you will never have that person? Dreadful feeling. Wouldn't recommend it. And so... I decided to give up. I can't take it anymore. I don't have any hope or strength left to cope with this. I'm sick of always watching couples enjoying themselves... I'm going to take some pills and jump of the roof of company HQ. 'tis only twelve stories...

					On considering suicde-and considering others
				","

							We are told that if we are consdiering suicide, we should take into account the feelings of those we might leave behind. This is reasonable, but it ignores the fact that there are people, like myself, who don't have anyone-no family,no friends, absolutely no one. I don't know why loneliness and being unwanted has been the curse of my life, but it has. It's just a horrible fact of life. Since I have no one who cares about me, does that mean that my suicide is more ""justified"". I am probably going to kill myself before the end of this year anyway; but if I had a ton of family and friends, why would my suicide be ""more wrong""?

					What keeps you going ?

							As a teacher, I know that my kids need positive experience at school. Even if they don't perform well, it's very important to feel a supporting hand, someone that acknowledge their potential.

					I'm fascinated by suicide and I want to know what it's like...
				","

							I am not unhappy, at all. I have a lot of friends and nothing in my life is going wrong at all. I simply am just fascinated by the fact that someone has the choice to take their own life, to hold that in their own hands. A kid I knew, not well, I only met him a few times... killed himself about 2 years ago. He had tons of friends, there wasn't a person that didn't like him, he was a software engineering major at a huge school. I don't know why he killed himself or even if there was a note, but something about that situation makes me think he knew something. Or that he just knew that life needed to go on without him. I've been thinking about suicide a lot lately and even though I don't think I have the courage, yes, I said courage, to kill myself, mainly because I couldn't even bare to think about what it would do to my family and friends, I wish I could. I just need to know what happens and what it's like. I feel like if I ever get the oppurtunity to have a gun in my hands, I could think about doing it. Is there something wrong with me? It's kind of scary how much it fascinates me. I'm sure there have to be other people out there that is fascinated by it. And I'm sorry if I've offended anyone with depression related suicidal thoughts.

				","

							This morning I woke up to 17 twitter updates from my ex. He was talking crazy, not making much sense. He is bi-polar. I have known him 18 years and we started dating last summer, but things ended in early June. I guess I should state that things ended during a manic episode that he was having and he cut me out of his life. That was the second time since we started dating that he did that. I have recently been hearing from him again..just casual chit chat and when I read the twitter updates this morning, I became concerned about him. I texted him early this morning and asked if he was alright. He said ""No."". I asked if he wanted to talk about it and he said ""No. Its insanity"". So I told him that I would listen if he changed his mind and that he could talk to me anytime. His reply was ""Too drunk. Gonna die in the next 9 months. No order. Only chaos"". He then went on to say that he was at the point that if there was no more him, then there was no more. He was fine with death now. I know he has attempted suicide in the past, most recently in 2005 and he said in his twitter update that he was feeling like he did in 2005. I don't know what to do or what to say. I don't know any of his family and any of his friends that I know are far too shallow and narcissistic to even care. His last text to me said ""Me tomorrow = drinks. Today c mean"". I'm not even sure what he is trying to say there and he will no longer answer me. ](*,)

							I still don't understand why i can't get control of my life. Emotions keep affecting my choices i make and its scares me. On the other hand i make it a priority to be a logical person to a T on the surface! I do a good job and keeps my work intact and friends to an extent...on the other hand im very emotional introspectively and emotional with my family and close relationships. Im troubled with my self image and as a result struggle with close relationships and my family. I try ignore that side of me and just get by day to day but i eventually come back to looking at myself and its ugly. I end up depressed and anxious and extreme paranoia! The paranoia is what scares me! This is may seem ridiculous but i become paranoid of getting sick or disease especially lethal or STD's Ive practiced safe sex and been tested partner or two ago. The logical step is to test all the time as it may not show up first couple. But regardless of logical answer for that emotionally i feel dead. I guess i should be alone in that regard if i fear. On flip side cancer could happen to anyone scares me. Im sorry to write this if anyone thinks im overreacting but my emotions are acting irrational and i dont know how much longer i can resist! With suicide so common seems like its not entirely bad to rule it out logically speaking. I understand that it may be the only way to correct this situation. My life isnt entirely bad though just my emotions i don't get it! My family shoots me down everytime i try to talk to them because they look at me at being myself or weak. Doctor looks at me like a disease or a drug. Friends have no opinion or don't realize i think they have there own business. The world might look at me like a statistic thats scary. Almighty looks at me as a defect in creation. Im sorry this is long but im must be thorough; im 28 and seems as i get older as a guy i get more ugly too ive put on 40 pounds last 4 years, yes i work out. Im not very domesticated. Im was engaged couple years ago but didn't work out and im single to this date, i feel the quality of dating will decrease with age as my body keeps attacking my vanity. I drink alot when im down and continue to smoke off and on. I invest on the stock market which has its swings. I don't feel a typical suicide. just a balancing scale between my torn emotions and my plush logic. I need to nap in that marble orchard soon enough because this equation is too much for me to continue further please please understand!!!!

I haven't seen my dad since I was a baby, but she got re-married to my stepdad, and now she hates me and wants to move on with her life and her new family. And please, please DON'T say I'm overreacting, because she even says that and it's plainly obvious if you observed our house for more than an hour. It's obvious to me now that natural maternal love is a lie, she tossed me aside like I was garbage ever since I was 14. She buys food for herself and her husband but buys me nothing. She tells me to drink tap water while her and her husband drink coffee and soda and smoke cigarettes and eat take out food. She doesn't give me money for a haircut or school supplies. The only way I can get these things is by selling my old video games and I'm almost out of the money I got from that. I'm wearing old clothes and everyone at school makes fun of me for it, so I have no friends. If I ask her for a drink or clothes she'll tell me to f*** off and hit me, and then when I defend myself against her she calls the cops and they take her side and act like I'm the bad guy. She told me she doesn't care if I died and couldn't wait until she could kick me out so that she would never have to see my face again unless it was in the obituaries page. And when I tell other family members about her she lies to them and they all tell me that I'm overreacting or lying. She's a really terrible person."

I have begged though and acted like such an idiot that I can tell she is closer to the other guy now and it's very painful to watch. I have nowhere to go.

					Need advice
				","

							Hi everyone. Thanks for taking the time to read. I'm writing because I would like some advice. Well first of all, I have suicidal thoughts a lot lately, and I'm the type of person that few if anyone would ever expect to since Im positive, uplifting, forgiving, and smile a lot. The reason I've seriously given it some thought is because something is wrong with me physically. I experience a great deal of pain on a daily basis and when I am around people I totally suck it up. I've been to countless numbers of doctors (both general practitioners and specialists) and all they ever say is that my chart shows that I have some of the best health that they've ever seen but they wouldn't think of saying that if we could trade bodies even fir a second. You're probably wondering what kinda illness? Well I don't know as o haven't been given any diagnosis but the beat way yo describe is that I have all of the major symptoms of diabetes except I'm unable to have relief. This started back around 4 yrs ago. I am extremely thirsty, when I drink I have to immediately urinate, now I feel hot on the inside as if I'm burning up, and my skin is progressively drying out. Then although I'm naturally confident it's gotten to me because I don't look or feel like the person I used to be. My skin used to be perfect...smooth and radiant, with glowing white eyes and guns (bicep muscles) that would turn heads but now it's all faded. I know that we're not really the body and that it's merely a vehicle in this life/physical reality though i'm going through this and the main thing that bothers me is that no one can find anything wrong. I tested negative to diabetes 6 times and also diabetes insipidus (DI) twice. Although I tested negative for DI twice the doctor thought it was ok for me to try the desmopressen, so I tried for a year and it did absolutely nothing for me. All I know is that I have some type of water wasting disorder going on and because of it I rarely ever sweat, have body aches, muscle tics, dry skin, serious pressure sensation in my head, and an unquenchable thirst. The only time I feel is is directly after waking up and maybe directly before sleep. Waking up to this feeling everyday is a nightmare. I love life and respect people that focus on living and helping others and anyone that is genuine for that matter... I'm still do young and I really always wanted to have a familybif my own. There's even a young lady that I know that wants yo marry me but I can't get involved with someone with me being like this. Btw this all started after a car accident whereby an old man in his 80's ran a red light and smacked the mess outta my car whereby I spun around several times. I thought I was fine as there was no apparent exterior damage yo my body but boyyyyy was I wrong. The next thing you know I became extremely agitated and stressed out so when I got home I took this liquid mineral drink called "

					The Easy Way Out
				","

							I don't understand how people can say that suicide is the easy way out... I mean... I feel like its the most toughest thoughts I ever have... I feel like I'm being ripped apart every single day more and more... I thought I knew myself...I have a conscious mind of how I am as a person.. And yet... suicidal thoughts bring comfort to me to imagine myself dead...but then they also cause me so much pain... apart from the pain I already feel about life and living... Like I've said before... I'm most likely not going to... I just don't understand how people can say that its the easy way out...when I feel like its the hardest....

					Success Doesn't Fix It
				","

							My little sister was diagnosed with depression a few years back, and since then I've been trying to help her cope with this new reality. One of the things that frustrated her the most was that she could feel better no matter what she did or accomplished. I began to explain to her one of the sad realities I had to learn, and that's that success isn't a quick fix for depression. She's been making tremendous strides in her life, and achieving things she always dream of. She completed her degree. She got a modeling contract with Ford. She's been traveling all over the world, but the depression still haunts her, despite the fact that she feels she should be happy. I remember how hard it was to have that conversation with her, because it's definitely one of those things that can easily make you lose hope. I mean, if you can't be happy even when you succeed, then why live? This is such a difficult way to ""live."" I remember growing up and learning it on my own. No matter how well I did in school, or anything I accomplished I still had this hole. IN the past year, I've been hospitalized 2 twice for failed attempts, and I've had two secret failures. I'm beginning to see success in music and I'm moving toward things that other people dream, but I'm not happy at all. That makes me feel worse, because I know there are so many people who are fighting to get where I am, yet I don't seem to appreciate it the way I should. I want this to be over so badly. I hate when people say, ""Killing yourself is easy if you "

							So a couple weeks ago I tried to jump off a bridge. The police were called on me and they got there just in time. They arrested me and took me to a place called Oaklawn on suicide watch. I hated being there so I lied my butt off to get out of there. So after getting out and going to see a therepist I found out I'm bipolar and they put me on some anti-depressents but i never take them because I'm an idiot. After finding out I was bipolar I got really depressed because I knew that whatever chance I had of getting into the Marines was gone. Then a couple days ago my roommates in the appartment I live in got in a huge fight and I got kicked out. So for about two days I was homeless and I had to have two people with me at all times so I couldn't try to kill myself. Now they let me move back in but everyone keeps fighting all the time and I can't leave because I have nowhere to go. I can't take this anymore! I'm gonna kill myself but this time in a way that won't draw attention to me until after I'm already dead.

							Up until two years ago... my family was very wealthy, I was very talkative and funny, I would have every girl behind me and every guy wanting to be my friend. They all did what I said, everyone loved me, I was the teacher's favorite always, the parents loved me. I found a lot of great friends that were very much like me... I could have asked for nothing more. Now I'm 16; two years ago my family's business went bankrupt, we all lost everything, for two years I was kind of okay I still had my friends, money and friends has been the only thing I cared about for my entire life. Every day that passed I became less attractive for some reason, I lost confidence in myself, I discovered I was gay, I don't know what happened but I just wasn't funny anymore, suddenly I had nothing interesting to talk about, and so I didn't anymore. I moved away with no money or emotional strength to make new friends. I kept holding on to my past and not making as many friends here. Now it has come to a point that my old friends grew up and are no longer there, my new friends aren't good enough, and I am lost in a living hell. I've been in love like four times with some of my good friends here and right now I am really into my friend Albert. I can't take this loneliness anymore, I don't have many friends, my family was never close and I have no money. I don't want to live anymore I just want to disappear.

					i think its over for me
				","

							I have been depressed or sad about my life for as long as I can remember.  Rarely can I think of an extended period of time when I was happy or even content with my life.  I cant seem to make friends or even worse cant find love.  I cant even find a girl that will like me enough to give me a chance.  I am constantly having my heart broken.  Each time I want to believe it will be different.  But I always end up hurt.  I don’t know what to do or what is wrong with me.  There are many nights I wish I wouldn’t wake up.  I have now been on antidepressants but dont think they are working.  The only friend I have only ever wants to go out and get drunk and talk  *  *  *  * .  And he doesn’t care who he goes with.  Its doesn’t matter if its me there or someone else or no one else.  I need more than that in my life.  I feel like I cant relate with my family.  I don’t feel close to my parents which is probably my fault for trying to distant myself always.  I know they love me and care about me but I don’t know how to love back.  I don’t know what to do anymore.  I want to die.  Have for a long time.  But I am too scared that I will fail at even that too.  The other reason is that I want to at least once in my life feel like I am or was a success.  I want to feel like what I have done has been good enough.  I want to make a difference.  But I don’t think it will happen.  I don’t have much but what I do have can be split between my brother and sister.  Im tired of people thinking im lame.  Im tired of sleepless nights.  I tired of rejection.  Im tired of being alone.  Too many nights I have looked at a bottle of pills with a bottle of vodka in my hand and just thinking tonights the night I do it.   I cant live like this.  I have tried sleeping pills to help and they don’t seem to work. I have tried natural remedies for depression and they don’t work.   Now I am trying modern medicine and it doesn’t seem to work.  I go days without eating.  It just hurts inside so bad.  I want to disappear.  I want it to be over.  I need to end this now.

I graduated high school as a member of NHS with a 3.7 GPA and scored a 33 on the ACT.  All the classes I took were Honors or AP and I scored 4s and 5s on all my AP exams.  I was an Eagle Scout by the time I was 16.  I've been at Michigan State University for two years and I've been earning good grades despite having an extremely challenging course load.  Almost everyone I meet compliments me on what a hard worker I am, how polite I am, etc.  None of it ever gave me any sense of pride or fulfillment.  I felt like there was no point in anything that I did."

							I used to be encompassed by the romanticism of christianity. It's who I was. Simply an identity. But now as I have drawn my self far from that which I believe was simply a lie, I'm even more lost than I was before. I wake up everyday, not wanting to get out of my bed. Thinking, what's the point of going to school today? What's the purpose of all of this journey b.s. people tell me. ""Life doesn't have an end game, it's the journey they say"" Well what if my journey is miserable? What if I once always held a purpose that I believed I thought I had in the world close to me, and now I don't ever see that purpose coming to fruition or even real, any longer? If everyone dies at sometime, be it at a young age, middle age, or old age, then what am I waiting for if I'm so miserable where I am now? Until I can be old and miserable? I don't see a point in living any longer. I'm so tired of the adage: a few moments of happiness are worth living. That's completely untrue. I never remember the times I was happy. In moments of hurt and pain all I can think of is that hurt, that pain. This idiotic universe has young children that starve to death everyday and I'm able to have food at my whim, yet I'm still unhappy, it makes me want to end my life so I can't stop feeling so guilty for this self-centered view I have, an outlook I sometimes think I can change but then realize that it's way too hard, maybe even impossible to change what is essentially a human. I don't see what I have to offer the world anymore. Or what it has to offer me. I'm indelibly invaluable just like every other human being on earth and deserve to feel more than just a wash cloth that my friends, family, neighbors, and strangers can use. I'm a selfish, eighty-dimensional, vile human being that just wants to be eliminated. I find myself wishing to get cancer or die by getting run over so I will allow the universe, God, mother nature, whom ever the a-hole may be to continue to step over me, just to not break rank because I feel beaten. Beaten down by the world. Where do I turn to now? Religion? That's failed me. God? He/She has failed me? Family, friends? They've failed me. Myself? I've failed me. Who; then? Only one entity. The one who is so FAIR, so JUST, so BLIND, yet so BEAUTIFUL. Death. Death, herself. The only thing I know I can count on. I don't know why I'm writing in this forum I stumbled on. But I know I need help or I'm as good as dead. I can't even stop myself from crying right now. I haven't attempted suicide before. But, if you knew me, then you'd know I'm not one to ""attempt"" something, I would rather get it done the first time if i'm even gonna try...

They even have to go to pubs of my choice rather than of theirs 99% of the time. They can only go out on their own 2 days a week when my mum looks after me. I feel sorry for them. Also I do DJing as a hobby but practice at home. I practice when my dad and his gf are there, though they enjoy it and dance together, I constantly feel I am preventing them having a quiet romantic evening in. I asked my dad whether I should give up my DJing so that they could be together more and he said no. And i am scared that if ever they spilt up, then no other woman would put up with it. I have told him I would give up my life because of them and am in a conflict over whether I should give up my DJing."

					What should I do?

							I believe one of my friends is suicidal, tonight she said that she wanted out permanently.  I think the stress of her life is getting to her.  She has Asperger's Syndrome, so I think that because she has a ""thin skin"" she let people get to her more than you and I would.  She works part time and lives with her parents.  I want to get her some help, and I think that if her parents knew, they'd help her.  However, she is 32, so I don't really want to rat her out, or be childish about this.  I mean she is a full grown adult.  I don't really know what to do, any advice?

							This is one of the things that saddens me.  I always ask myself, ""Why will they cry when I'm dead but shed not a tear while I'm alive and so miserable?""  Nobody can know the severity of your problem until it's too late.  Everybody thinks when I talk of killing myself that it's not serious and that it'll never happen.  It's almost as if they're daring me to do it, yet I know if I did they would want to take what they said back then.  "

							I never knew I was such a lousy person. I woke up to a horrible message from a person today on Facebook. I was told that I'm self-centered, negative, rude, ugly and a horrible artist. I'm an idiot as well. I struggle every day to tell myself that I'm an attractive person and that I have so much to offer. I don't have friends. It's hard for me to have time for people if I'm lucky enough to find someone to spend time with. I have been dealt a horrible hand in life. I'm not just saying it to be dramatic, I think most would understand if they only knew. Rather, if they only listened. No one is willing to listen or to even try to begin to attempt to understand. I've dated complete jerks. I've been the victim of my father and child molestation. I was abandoned by my mother. I was used by my foster family to make them look better in society. I work very hard and work insane hours that no one is willing just to be able to pay the bills. I've put myself through school and I still continue to do so all the while facing problems with cost and tuition. But I'm trying my hardest. I always do. I just have so much that has gone wrong. I try to not dwell but seriously how can you not when they seem to just keep happening one after another. I beg and pleed for something to go right each day every morning. I don't have anyone to talk to and it just keeps growing and growing. I seceretly have been facing demons for a long time in regards to suicide. I honestly think that if I didnt have my pets, who always seem to make me happy, that I would have done something a long time ago. they are what keeps me going. it would be selfish for me because they depend on me. They are just as misunderstood as I so I know that my life ending would mean their lives ending. I'm restless all the time. I toy with the idea of what I could do and when. How would I do it? Questions of that nature. I'm finding that I'm completely at peace with death. I'm not worried or scared. I actually find myself almost happy knowing that once I'm gone nothing can hurt me anymore. Not happy as in laughing more calm and euphoric I guess. I kind of feel great. I wish that I could feel this good about living. I'm just so sick of hurting so so badly. I'm sick of being alone and so disliked. It seems that everyone in this city has their opinions about me and nothing is true. besides they all never really knew me. It's mostly based upon a horrible relationship I was in before. the guy was incredibly emotionally, mentally, physically and sexually abusive. People looked out for his best interest. They never knew or believed the truth. I have never had good friends really and that's all I want. I actually have no friends. I had a couple and was mocked and ridiculed by them. I felt like I was the loser chick in high school kicked out of the cool girl club and if anyone knows what it's like to deal with mean girls, it sucks. Not to mention try working with them and having the boss adore them and make your life hell. Things just don't work out for me. I just don't know what to do. I try so hard to not give up but whats the point anymore. People mock me for being bipolar and for being poor. it really hurts. I just want friends. I don't even have family except for my pups. I don't think I'm ever going to have friends and for that matter a guy in my world. I guess it's over for me. People like me are just not worth much.

							I just feel like what ive been going thru has permanently messed up my mind. I was trying to find a way for me to not have a breakdown today because my mind was completely out of it. Its like right now if i looked at people the way i normally do i wouldnt right anything because i dont trust people to help me with my situations. Everything im going thru seems so much worse then everyone elses. Its crazy because i know alot of people go thru alot of crazy things but i really dont care anymore. Its like i cant even talk to people because im so messed up in my mind that if they do anything to trigger me im just going to lose it. Ive basically been fighting to keep my sanity because of how many messed up things ive had to go thru. Alot of people wont understand that i cant even talk about them because i really need to block them out as much as possible. I really feel like i cant be myself and just need to find anyway possible to get my mind off of what im going thru. I used to live in my own world my whole life but i couldnt do that anymore because of how messed up that made me when all of this started to happen. Its just i dont really have any other choice because there isnt anything else i can do. Ive basically have had so many panic attacks everyday that it seems impossible. Ive done everything that i feel is really possible to try to keep myself from really losing it that im able to do. Im sure everyone will say that i need to do whatever and thats the only way ill get better but you dont get how im not able to do anything to get better. My mind is in such a twisted and dark place that if i did anything even close to what i thought i would basically ruin my life forever. Im sure people talk about forgiveness and forgetting but you dont always get that luxury. I just always see how i dont get that many things that dont just completely turn into a <removed>. Im trying to hold back all these messed up things going on with me but I dont even know if thats helping me anymore. Im not stupid or am not someone that you can even try to say that im not trying but what is the point in trying if it doesnt do anything. I can say whatever good things have happened or gotten better that ive had to deal with so much  <removed>. Im just wondering if its really possible for things to keep gettin worse like this. Its just i know it is but i dont know how you can ever make it back from that far."

							I dont really think im trying to get anyone to help me but i dont know. Im not suicidal but i feel like ive been for so long that i dont even know how to live a life that it isnt a part of it. I honestly could have a panic attack and freak out and just basically be fighting for my life at any moment. Ive never tried it but i have basically seen that just thinking about doing it can help me just feel like i get away from my painful life. Ive always lived in my own world and basically having that world be shattered is one of the biggest issues ive had to deal with. Its just for whatever reason i cant completely leave my world and deal with my real life. I have alot of issues that i cant even go into because it brings me right back into how i was before. I think simple things like just going thru a day without wanting to basically do something bad to myself or anyone else is a struggle. I dont know how to talk about this but even like eating or taking care of myself are things i can do easily. "

							I'm eighteen years old. I've been with the same manipulating, cheating, lying, succubus for the last five years. We were suppose to have a daughter last April, but her father aborted her. She is constantly throwing her affairs in my face. Pictures, videos, stories... She say's she cares yet she does it over and over again. She feeds off anything she can do to hurt me and shares it openly with her friends and lovers. So here's the fun part. Why am I still with her? I've tried leaving her several times, all in which she was completely apathetic. Weeks sometimes months later she would show up and sleep with me and leave and that's the last I would hear from her for awhile. I finally figured out I was pathetic and put and end to all ties to her. In my absence she was fine. I think she met several new guys and friends and what not, But I on the other hand had no friends or anybody. I was alone all the time. Basically I sat alone in my room from the time I woke up til the time I went to sleep. At first I thought I was okay with this and continued playing computer games and what not. After about the sixth month of our breakup I couldn't take it any longer. I went to see her and it was all for nothing. We spent the night together and everything went out the window. Back to the start. After getting jealous when she cheated again I decided to move to another Country. After doing this my life didn't really change at all. I continued to stay in my room for the next 7 1/2 months alone. Eventually I realized something was wrong with me after I freaked out one night and tried to drown myself in my bathroom. A week later I went to a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with OcD, Depression and Social Anxiety Disorder. "

							I read sometimes how so many people go through tough times in their lives and are at their end of their wits and think sucide is the way out.

Does anyone get that feeling of not going through with it? And what are you reason's for not going through with the sucide?

I've spent the last hour looking for something I can do comfortably. I HATE THIS! I HATE BEING THIS WAY! If I wasn't so afraid of the madness I'd go back to the pills, but what that does to your mind was worst than what I'm feeling now, and then there is till no guarantee considering I'm still after how much I took last time.

							Up until two years ago... my family was very wealthy, I was very talkative and funny, I would have every girl behind me and every guy wanting to be my friend. They all did what I said, everyone loved me, I was the teacher's favorite always, the parents loved me. I found a lot of great friends that were very much like me... I could have asked for nothing more. Now I'm 16; two years ago my family's business went bankrupt, we all lost everything, for two years I was kind of okay I still had my friends, money and friends has been the only thing I cared about for my entire life. Every day that passed I became less attractive for some reason, I lost confidence in myself, I discovered I was gay, I don't know what happened but I just wasn't funny anymore, suddenly I had nothing interesting to talk about, and so I didn't anymore. I moved away with no money or emotional strength to make new friends. I kept holding on to my past and not making as many friends here. Now it has come to a point that my old friends grew up and are no longer there, my new friends aren't good enough, and I am lost in a living hell. I've been in love like four times with some of my good friends here and right now I am really into my friend Albert. I can't take this loneliness anymore, I don't have many friends, my family was never close and I have no money. I don't want to live anymore I just want to disappear.

Ive had to endure stuff that makes you turn into a messed up person. I constantly deal with thoughts of things that you should really never have to think about. I see that no matter how good of a person you are things can still make you into a messed up person. Ive never felt this low to where its like nothing matters. Its like i could kill myself right now and it would mean nothing but i guess thats the one good that Ive seen about myself is i wont kill myself. I actually dont talk about this alot but i actually would want to try to convince myself to kill myself because it was like no matter what i couldnt do it.

							I had a pretty rough childhood.  I try not to talk about it because people judge you, but I was sexually abused, had a crazy mom going to school working poor and on public aid, my father drinking his way to the grave-somehow he didn't die but had a blood clot in his brain and is disable.  I remained fairly positive and did well in school.  Occasionally I'd wish I had a different life, I'd imagine what some other girl I admired was doing, but only thought about suicide for very short seconds and hardly ever.  I waited until I was 22 or 23 to loose my virginity-I LOVED this boy.  We had issues ourselves and though I thought I was past mine this is a red flag for me.  We broke up a while ago we got back together a time or two.  I felt this was true love but knew that wasnt ok.  we had nc a year.  Everyone has put up with my sadness long enough.  I recently was seeing him and boy was I happy.  He had to leave for a commitment teaching in korea.  He met someone.  I want to feel joy for him, he left 6 months ago but I feel like the living dead.  I am sad and tired and have no desires.  The worst part is I have to tell my family I'm fine cause they have seen me sad too much.  My younger sisters father killed himslf and thats the thing that holds me back-I dont want her to loose anymore.  I told my older sister I don't see the point im life and she said that I need meds.  Shes taken them but not anymore.  Shes over a recent divorce and I can't get over loosing this boy I love.

I do things the way i do them because i feel like they are actually really good things to do. Its just im not surrounded by people that bring that out of me. Ive basically have had to stay away from people my whole life because of how ive been treated my whole life. Ive had alot of jealousy and envy for basically one thing and that was me being ok being myself. Its just that didnt do much good for me because my real life really sucked and i havent really been able to do anything for myself. Im basically an over-achiever that has under-achieved my whole life. Ive never had friends that i would consider close to me. Ive only meet one person that i really got along with and that was an online friend and she ended up basically completely changing on me and doing whatever she could to get rid of me. I basically tried to reason with her because i had no idea why she was the way she was and pretty much still dont.

The only relief I get is from cutting myself. It's the only thing that takes my mind away for any length of time, but they aren't a cure. I haven't even made it 2 full months since my last attempt. I don't want to be this way! I just want to be normal. I want to not wake up already feeling like crap. I don't care how it stops. I don't care if it's through some medicine, or therapy, or death.

							It's getting so hard to make it through the day. I finally finished my degree but I don't have any motivation to do anything. I want help but I can't ask for it. I was diagnosed with BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder), and one of the characteristics/symptoms is wanting to be saved. So, to overcome that I do my best to not talk to anyone about these feelings now. So now, I'm completely alone with them. I spend most of my days/nights semi or unconscious with the help of  an over the counter sedative. It's the only way I can keep myself safe other than cutting to distract myself from it. Even sleep isn't really that pleasant because I have chronic nightmares. How long is a person supposed to live before they're allowed to give up. The irony is that I have a kid sister who also struggles with depression and suicidal thought, and I'm the only person she talks to about it. I'm the one who's always trying to convince her that life is worth living. Meanwhile, inside I feel the exact same way as her. I'm so tired. I hate myself so much. I feel like a hypocrite and a failure. All the while the scars on my wrist remind me of how close I was to getting out. They're indicative of the resolve I had, the courage. I keep reminiscing. Just a few more minutes and it would have been too late. If I hadn't been found or if I it had been a 2 minutes longer, I would be here now.

							Ive been so up and down and its like nothing is moving along. I get a couple of hours at most where all my issues dont come and completely consume me with anger and depression. I keep on thinking it cant get worse and it does. I try to handle my emotions and everything the best that i can but usually i just go into a rage to where i feel like im losing myself. I feel like once you go thru so much you can never go back to how you were. I guess its not all that bad because i didnt like things so much before but at least it wasnt all bad. Ive had moments of complete darkness to where i sit in my room with nothing to do because i cant enjoy anything. I have so many things im going to have to work on and then so much work to really pursue any type of life for me. Ive been sleeping at all hours and its pretty f-ing crazy. Im like from another world where i cant even describe what my life is like on a day to day basis. Im just doing whatever i can to not really let all my messed up emotions go out towards anyone else. I cant even describe all the really sick thoughts i have. I then end up having to tell myself that my life will get better when most of the time i dont believe it. Im trying to but i just feel like ive been thru enough and this cant go on forever. I dont even know how to even live with what im going thru. I basically spend all my time thinking about things outside of myself. Im supposed to think that there is a place in this world for me and that somehow this was just a part of my life but its completely ruined so much without saying its pretty much ruined everything. I have no passion, no outlet, no place to go because even when im doing things everything still haunts me. I used to imagine having a better life and that would drive me but i dont see that happening anymore. I can see people that have things work out for them but what type of life are you supposed to live when things dont work out for you. Its only so much you can find in yourself to get thru the bad times. I cant even get along with most people now because im so out of it that i dont even feel like im in touch with what its like to be human. I dont want to get into alot of things about my past but i will say everything that ive been thru has made me have a couple of years of memory loss and battles with delusions and sucidal thoughts. Im doing everything i can without basically killing myself to deal with this or get something out of this. I also just get tired of people saying stupid things like oh this is a long post or its not all spaced or in paragraphs. Its like little things like that people just say all the time and for what. Its like im going thru so much and you think it matters if i wrote less or made it in order. The thing i dont like about that is that i dont go around and say oh wow yours is so short or its spaced out because people would take that as a compliment. Its just because alot of people think that way it becomes acceptable and then its fine. Im just so different and i dont see how im going to get along with people who arent like me because most people dont deal with that well and then i react out of defense and its just a big problem. I just wish there was some way to get a break from all of this craziness that happens all the time that people just deal with. Its just every little thing becomes a big thing because of all the stuff im going thru. I just wish someone could stop and really think but most people can only see things thru their own eyes and then someone like me is stuck because i try to look outside of myself. Its like things that can never be worked out and its like oil and water but with me im always sticking out or being the outsider so somehow im supposed to just deal with this all the time. It would just be nice if it didnt have to be to where im basically am struggling to where its pretty much embarrassing. I dont even know what im trying to say but i guess thats my problem is there is so much that cant be described and im struggling with it everyday. I just hope it doesnt drive me crazy or something eventho i cant count that out anymore.

							Hi"
"
					Thanks
				","

							I see a school counciller at the moment which is okay I guess but I am going to start group therapy soon. I am very suicidal and I haven't been going to school at all really about 2 days off a week and I am just completely lost between my panic attacks and depression, I am trying to be strong but I don't know how long I can carry on. I feel so stupid for writing this because I never really like to talk about things and posting a thread would be the last thing I would have done for my suicidal desires. "

					I need somebody to talk to
				","

							I feel there is nowhere else to go. As I am 13 ANYBODY that I tell I am thinking of suicide would displace me, or try to fool me by saying that everything will be alright. I don't understand this. What I really don't understand is why I want to go though. I am literally bored enough to not want to live anymore. It seems like I fit nowhere in life and I just can't cope with the fact that I live in a  *  *  *  * ty world, and may have to deal with it. I just need somebody to help me because I feel this is the last place I can go. The only place where I know I won't be proclaimed an idiot for doing what feels right for me."

							alright the past couple years i have felt that my life has been absolutely meaningless, There is nothing wrong with my life though, i have not suffered any trauma, i love my parents, problem is i dont believe in anything. What is the point to the game we play every day? why do people take it so seriously and why cant i learn to enjoy it and find meaning like everyone else? I am 17 years old and probably the most ordinary guy you would see, I have a lot of friends and i am fairly popular in my school, its just that when im with people i find that I have no real feelings of actually wanting or needing them as a friend/ aquantice. I really could care less what they do or say. I wouldnt care if suddenly they were just gone. i feel like i am living in a world in which everything is a lie and i am trapped. i am finding it hard to find purpose in the activities i do....i feel that i force myself to do them. if you met me there would be know way of knowing any of this about me besides the fact that i am quite and  display minimal amounts of emotion. the only thing i can find joy in is art. i can let out how i feel about the disgusting world in which im trapped in... I often contemplate the idea of suicide and wonder what it would be like to escape, but normally i instantly dismiss it because i am an atheist, i believe in nothing after life, so if i die now then i am done. and to be honest that idea scares me, but what scares me more is the idea of being trapped and not being able to escape. i really dont know what to do. And recently i have been under so much stress that i am beginning to want to end it...i feel like all i am is mediocrity, and thats all i want but people are belligerent and keep demanding more..i am getting sick of it. A user named Rain man posted something a little better worded a while ago that kind of says what i was trying to say about my feelings...please help me out on this, i feel so trapped

					My story
				","

							I was fine, not great, but fine nonetheless, until about a couple of months ago. I was sort of seeing this girl with whom I work with. As it turns out, I was merely nothing more than her ""crutch"", so to speak. You see, she's married to an abusive  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  who treats her like  *  *  *  * . So she comes to me one night, pouring her heart out about how unhappy she is and tells me that she's interested in me."
"
					Can I just... Disappear please...
				","

							Ahh, I gaze up at the stars with true moral inflection as my veins and my body twist and contort with every single emotion. Where am I heading to, is it a beautiful place? Is it something I want, will I regret it? Everything I've done has put me in a special place in life, a place where I wonder if I had only taken the last left turn would I be somewhere else? Ah... it only brings me down to the place, this shallow cold and desolate road, it brings me... I come to the place where I hide all my fears and put on a mask to show the world that I can smile and laugh but feeling so helpless and so cold when I shut my eyes. Every dream, every step, a permanent reminder of what has happened to me and why it has happened. Only to lead me to this path, a road that has no end, a road that blinds me with such agony and such pain. Emotions crawl inwards up my skin as the reaper sharpens his scythe, staring at my cold empty blue eyes, that are only dark with tears that haunt every inch of what is left of me. Is it right? Is it wrong... Where will I go... do I get a second chance? A second chance... It is what makes my blood pump with hope and keeps me moving throughout my bitter cold and empty roads. This path... I feel like I can just end it, take a nap, then I can finally find my peace in a world that feels so unscathed. Unscathed by the agony of truth, unscathed by the bitterness of cold reality. The world, a desolate and cold fate, the world, a dark and dreary empty place where hope is given to those who have the strength to find it. Where is my hope... where did my dreams go... Oh...that's right... They went away because of my weakness. My inability to grow, my inability to change fast enough, my dreams.... If only I had looked at the world right the first time, if only I had gazed with the eyes I have now could I have taken that other road.... But this path....I see no other turns, only a dead end. Is it the end for me.... It feels cold... my skin feels cold... my heart aches. Is it wrong for me to be selfish? Can I please be selfish? Just this once.... I'll turn to you, and I'll smile with up-most vigilence as I slowly slip the veil of deceit into my mouth. I am cold... I feel so cold.... I have yet to make a move, I wonder if it because I am scared of what will happen.... Where I am going.... why I am going there.... I slowly shut my eyes to feel the bitterness in my skin....ahh... that's right, I remember now."

							All I have in my life are books and DVDs. At the moment I can't even think of any books to get out. I have no friends at all. I have nothing to do in my spare time. Infact, I spend most of my spare time these days reading about suicide. The reasons I do have to live are my drama class, badminton, karate and DJ business. They aren't real reasons though. Nobody talks to me at drama and badminton, with the exception of 1 girl who talks to me at drama and she isn't a proper friend, I have a few 'friends' at karate but they are not real friends because I don't have anything to do with them outside of karate. As for my DJ business I have been doing it about 2 or maybe even 3 years and haven't got any gigs, if I did have one it would probably go wrong. I get spoken to a lot at my local pub because everyone is impressed by my karaoke singing. My parents love me, as does my dad's ex-girlfriend. But like I say she is an EX and she has nothing to do with us anymore. They only split up today so it's still possible they will get back together. I really liked the wonan and for ages she has been  my only reason to live. My parents are the only people that would give a ____ if I died. Also how can I tell my father about my feelings? And is there a way I can speak to the samaritans either secretly so that my dad can't hear or openly? I don't phone people much so if he heard I was on the phone he WOULD ask who I was phoning. So what do you think I should do about my life?

I spend all day researching and writing a motion to have my lawyer ""mentor"" walk downstairs to tell me I ***ed up and misaligned his name on the cover page.  He gives me zero guidance and zero praise.  He takes my work and puts his name on it.  He take my work and keeps all the money.  A law firm is a pyramid scam and they screw you until you quit or until you become just like the guys at the top. "

							My soon to be ex husband threatened suicide multiple times. It started when he asked me to take our son and leave his home. It continued on throughout the beginning of the summer, then by the end of the summer, when he ""got me back"" it ended. When I filed for divorce, he wanted to reconcile and threatened it again. Did anyone here ever use a suicide threat as BOTH a ploy AS WELL AS consider it seriously? "

							I have a new job pushing carts that I'm entirely grateful for, but I'm an utter failure at it (along with everything else in my life, and DO NOT SAY ""why not be a writer"" because I HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE writing and HATE people telling me I should do something boring like that with myself, but it's one of the only other ways I can express myself besides singing or masturbating and I don't even get that kind of relief from writing either.)  I have to be there AT GOD DAMN 7 IN THE GOD DAMN MORNING!  I'm all on my own too; I'm expected to know every little thing and be as good as the guy I'm replacing (and this dude made EMPLOYEE OF THE FRIKKIN MONTH ARGH!) but I've barely spent a shift outside.  I'm tired of having the damn weight of a job resting on my shoulders... I'm tired of living in this hell.  All I'm good at is ticking people off and work is no exception.  I'm most likely gonna fail this job sooooo bad, and my mom's gonna kill me.  I do everything wrong; show me how to do it right, and I will fail 9999999 times before I even SOMEWHAT succeed at it.  People like to make fun of me for this and I can't say I blame them... at least I make them laugh, even if it's at my expense.  I've failed everything; school, work, art... I hate me.  I can't even yank my rod and splatter my urges all over myself 'cause my mom is up all night watching TV (she's a super-feminist who treats women as if they're nothing less than supreme goddesses and men are evil creatures except the beta-males but I think both feminism and chauvinism is equally retarded) and is against necessary male things I wish I didn't have to do like masturbating.  I kind of hate women though; I don't HATE them personally, but I hate the relationship I have between me and womanhood.  When it comes to using the left side of my brain, I'm like worse than a male version of Usagi (Sailor Moon) and the loser ""Seinen"" guy thing doesn't work well in the real world... the underdog thing is only a fantasy.  The little guy gets chewed up and spit out in the real world... I hate it, but that's reality.  The underdog becoming a winner?  That's mostly only in the movies; I just feel doomed to mediocrity and it makes me wanna puke my god damn guts out and KEEP them out.  I feel sick to my stomach; I feel like all I'm gonna do is keep failing 'cause that's all I've truly experienced (kinda like Charlie Brown).  "

							Lately i've been feeling like someone has ripped my heart out and all i seem to feel is emptiness.  For the past few years life has been difficult.  I was bullied for four years and i was in a online relationship for about 3 years. I feel like these are the wounds i carry around with me.  Nobody knows about the online relationship, i haven't talked to nobody about it.  i tried to commit suicde over it last year which ended up with me being in hospital.  i remember lying awake in that hospital all alone that memory still haunts me.  Things did get better i got over the guy i fell in love with and i made friends at school.  The thing is i made friends with this really nice guy and he moved away and now i've just started to get close to some other people and we'll all be leaving soon.  I just feel like my life goes around like a circle.  Just when things start looking up i feel so depressed.  I've been feeling so alone, unwanted and unloved.  The other day i just burst into tears and i carried on like that into the next day too.  i feel like my life has no meaning to it and my existence was a mistake.  i always feel tired with aches and pains.  Today i havent been hungry once and when i ate some cereal it was as if i was just eating it for the sake of it.  it didn't give me any energy or anything.  i feel like my body wants to shut itself down.  I want to try killing myself again but can't bring myself to do it because i don't want it to fail again.  i forget about the pain by listening to music and watching movies pretending that will make me feel ok.  I have exams coming up and i have nothing in me that wants me to pass them.  I feel like i'm going nowhere, i have just given on everything and everyone.  Someone please help me.

					How can I change my life?
				","

							Hi, I am looking for answers. I have been on and off depression meds for the past 5 years. None of them have helped. Ive been on Lexapro, Wellbutrin, and Zoloft. I dont know what is wrong with me. I dont enjoy life at all. I feel too tired to do anything. Everyone just says I am lazy, but I feel that is is much more than that. I have no motivation for life, I wish I had a another way to describe it, but I have no passion for anything, at all. I used to write, I havent written anything in years, something inside of me is just completely dead. I used to ride the bus, and come up w/ fun little stories, just being out and around people inspired me. Now I just want to sit in my room. I was nearly kicked out of college this semester (I dropped my courses so that I couldnt be disqualified.)"
"
					Is it worth it?
				","

							I am here because I don't know where else to be.  I don't want to burden anyone with my thoughts but I can't write them down fast enough.  In my short 32 years, I have lost my father to a tragic accident, had my best friend/adopted little sister murdered, had a friend commit suicide and many more deaths and tragedies.  I was anorexic and lucky for me it was caught early, doesn't seem so lucky to me now I am fat and ugly and unwanted.  If you have seen the movie ""Twilight"" you will understand a little what I am thinking.  There is this amazing relationship between Edward and Bella and that is what I need.  I feel so drawn to the characters it's not even funny, I feel a lot like Bella, odd and ordinary.  I am nothing spectacular and have been verbally abused my whole life.  I am having a hard time just getting my butt out of bed.  To have human affection would greatly help me, just being touched gently or kissed or hugged.  But with society the way it is, I don't even see that possible.  Why do things we humans want so bad only ever happen in movies?  I haven't thought about ending my life for a few months, I was doing really good, maybe it's because I have been on and off my medication, wish I could afford it all the time.  It really helps but even taking it, I am still feeling this way.  I want to not kill myself, just render myself unconscious for a few days and make the world see that I am here and see if I really do have any friends.  That sounds dumb too.  I have a huge crush on this guy (yeah it still happens to us old farts) and he is one of the few people I can talk to when I see him.  He's super kind and I find my  heart twitter when I see him, that is an amazing feeling but I guess that is all it will be.  I used to have penpals to write snail mail letters to and that was really good for me but nobody wants to write letters anymore, wish they did.  Anyways, I could ramble on and on but it's all going to say the same."

							I can't be bothered with dealing with everything any more, well I'm worthless anyway, my mum doesn't care, my family don't care, my ""friends"" don't care, words on a white background on a computer screen, they don't care either, my shrink doesn't care, my ""care"" coordinator doesn't care, no one cares. Oh well, I should be used to it by now. "
"
					You've all thought it
				","

							I've decided that i don't see the point in living. I know that i must live until i'm 42, because that's when i can be sure they are all dead, but I wish i could just kill myself now.  i hate my life, i know the people around me either wouldn't care or would get over it."
"
					Dont read if you dont care
				","

							I dont know where to begin, no one on this forum seems to want to talk to me. I dont know why, it could be because ABSOLUTELY NOBODY CARES about me. Its not just a thought i believe it because of people are never there for me when i need it , or at all. I dont have anyone..at all. I just cant meet good people. All i know are bad people. A lot of bad things have happened to me and they just continue to keep happening, and theres nothing i can do to stop it. I want to be dead. Im tired of the pain physically and mentally, im tired of worries, and stress, and emotions, im tired of thoughts, and people, just everything. If nobody feels like responding to me, it just backs up my beliefs that nobody cares.

					I dont even know if suicide is the word anymore
				","

							Ive had to deal with suicidal thoughts for over 2 years. It all started once my ex was going to break up with me. At first she needed time but that was really just an excuse to break up with me but she couldnt do it. She was spending time with someone else and she was basically caring more about him then me. I cant even begin to describe how crazy my life has been since. Ive been delusional, my memory was basically totally blocked out after it happened, i have severe anxiety and OCD, and basically am stuck living the same  *  *  *  * ty life i had to live before. I have no real friends and my ex was basically the only friend that i could consider a good friend. Its just at the same time she was abusive and neglectful. Anyone that has never been around that will basically simply say that its not good for you so you should be happy that your not with them. Its just that becomes your comfort level so even if its not good for you your mind makes it like it is. I really dont know how you get away from someone that you were also really codependent with. Ive tried therapy and have gone to support groups but that doesnt fix anything. I basically wont be able to get over this until the pain from all of this is over. Thats where i end up having to deal with my very messed up life so either way i dont see things gettin better for me. I can say to keep hope alive and to keep trying to see if things get better but that can only work for so long. Ive hit rockbottom and have been there again so i dont really see much else happening. This is what i feel like inside completely black and empty with no real life."
"
					This feels different then all the other times
				","

							Ive wrote about suicide alot on this site but this is the first time that its really serious. Usually its a panic type situation and even then ive been really close. I try to believe that if you deal with it that it will get better but too many people end up commiting suicide anyways and i dont think i do anything different then what they do. The closest i got was once day thinking i was going to jump into the ocean at night so no one can see me and just drown myself. Im now probably alot more dramatic about it and think of ways that everyone can see it. Im now in a phase where im looking for attention and i hate it. I hate everything that ive become. I basically see all the things i hate about people growing up and have become all of those. Im pretty sure it has to do with me not wanting to be like my family. I basically dont want to be like them to the point where i dont even spend time with them because i dont want anything about them to rub off on me. Its just that doesnt change that i will be like them and even if i dont like it will always be somewhat like them. Ive had a family history of suicide attempts in my family. Its pretty sad because around everyone i grew up pretty much all of them have tried it. I also dont want to take any medication because i dont think im in a state of mind to really even go thru with it and dont want to be stuck taking meds the rest of my life just to try to be happy or sane."

							I've kind of been having ""bouts"" of depression and aggravation. Recently (the past month or so), I've been considering suicide very seriously. I haven't attempted it yet, because I want to wait until my death won't hit my family so hard. Right now, everybody's having too much fun doing too many things; I don't want to ruin it. However, I have planned several ways to kill myself and have on several occasions found myself rehearsing slashing/stabbing my carotid artery. I know I could do it and want to do it; but I also want to minimize the damage it does to my loved ones."
"
					My heart is broken and I didn't know him that well
				","

							Well I'm going through a rough break-up, moving my things out this Saturday. Since the break-up I looked for an old friend (who was kinda a hook-up, we weren't super close but had fun times together and he was a friend) on myspace. Basically I found out he had Bipolar Disorder and killed himself in March of this year. I haven't spoken with him since December of 07. I've never had to deal with the death of someone that I've been intimate with... it breaks my heart to know he's gone and that BD killed him. My mom also has BD and has tried to kill herself before while she was messed up on a bunch of pills, and she's been on and off lithium like the guy was. Has anyone else had to deal with an ex's suicide? I cried last night about it, but I just try to think of the good times we had, I know it wasn't his fault, it was that stupid BD. I'm not religious, but I think maybe I'll see him again one day. It was just such a shock to be looking him up to say hey and then find that out, especially since it happened only a month ago... I feel like if I spoke to him sooner I could've helped him.

							My dad has a girlfriend that he really likes, but says he doesn't get on with and will have to dump her for a number of reasons. But I really love the woman in the same way that I would love a parent, she has been a major part of my life for the past 5 months and I feel that I would kill myself if we lost her. Also I strongly doubt he will find someone else to replace her.

							I just don't know why it plays like a record in my head! I have alot going for me. Seems like im different than most people. Im 27 guy considered myself good looking have very nice income. I like tech stuff like computers, movies etc. Im not a nerd nor look like one but in my situation is i can't relate to ppl around me somehow and i feel isolation and this baffles and sends me into spiral of depression with the bottle etc. Ive had many opposite sex relationships but they never work out. i feel empty emotionally but my ambition keeps me from looking back. Im concerned about this. Is there anybody out there that has everything but love and what should be recognized and done!???

					** just sighs **
				","

							Was doing good... havent cut or burned since i got outa the hospital. Ive wanted to... ive wanted to really bad but i guess the fact that its out in the open and they are looking for it has stopped me, but i couldnt help myslef tonight. Went looking for a lighter and when i couldnt find one resorted to cutting. Why is it never enough ? the second it stops bleeding i gotta do it again and go deeper so it bleeds longer. I just watch as the blood pools in the newly formed slices in my skin and streaks down my arm. My arms stinging now and i actually like it. why do i like the pain so much? dont see my new phyciatrist and counsler for another week or so but i really dont see how its going to help. They just keep throwing more labels on me and more pills at me that really dont help at all. I truly dont see myself ever being happy. im just trudging through each miserably day... living outa guilt. Ive never know any other way of looking at life. Ive never know what its like to feel any other way. Apparently ive been like this since i was around 4. How can talking with some phyciatrists and counselors really change my entire outlook on life. Do i even want my outlook to change? life truly does seem so trivial and meaningless. Whats the point of going through all the misery when were just going to die eventually anyways? Nothing last forever... why not just make that end come alittle sooner? why am i even posting here? Am i really sadistic enough where i need others to know the pain i feel? Am i really so desperate for attention that i need to complain to people i dont even know? guess ill just keep sighing and letting it all run through my head. I could try my distractions like ive been doing. Go get lost in a book or go out with some people but thats what i did today and it only makes my mind race even more. Whats the point ? Now more then ever going out with people feels like more of an exhausting chore then anything else. Ive been labled with borderline personality disorder and social phobia among other things. Ever since this all came out in the open a couple weeks ago i feel like its worse now then ever. Or maybe im just noticing it more. i dont even know anymore. Does it really matter ? I hate being alone but i hate being around people even more...really how should i handle that ? I just want to die... Why wont people just let me be in peace? why is death, as natural as it is, such a horrid thing for people?

					i really really need help
				","

							I just came out of the bathroom from using a #18 IV needle and I just got extremely upset when someone didn't get the message that I wanted to take a shower and hurried me out, even though they, my M-I-law and my husband, have no clue. I really really want to kill myself. I'm a veteran with severe deppression and PTSD but I don't dare ask for help because nobody even imagines what I was planning. I'm a christian and I got really upset because I always say God is never late, but for the first time in a long time I got upset that he used my MIL to let me know he was there and knew."

							Should I be worried if someone who is very depressed says things like these (they were in the context of a discussion about gang violence that led to school shootings): "
"
					Curious.
				","

							Recently I've noticed that I've been feeling more and more depressed lately, normally I can act cheerful and pleasant and yet inwardly I feel as though I want it all to end. I understand that people everywhere go through these types of thoughts and yet I am starting to worry. Sometimes I will write suicide notes and wills in my head and recently despite my best efforts I can't seem to find the will to be motivated or find a purpose or joy in my life. I despise people who simple use religion or hot lines as reasons to stop suicidal thoughts and I also have no one I can seriously talk to about this. So I am curious at what I am supposed to do? How am I supposed to fix these thoughts when I can barely get my life in order, many people out there have it much tougher than me and yet I can barely find the courage to plaster on a fake smile anymore. I am starting to resent myself and everyone around me and I don't know what to do. I don't want people to fix my problems...I just was someone to say something that might make my situation just a little bit more bearable. Sorry if this imposes on anyone.

I can't concentrate, feel tiered all the time, I just want to sleep. I  either feel completely numb or completely depressed. My family will hate me for giving up in college, not that they would ever admit it cause they are too supportive for that. But I know I'm letting everyone down. It seems like it would be better if I stop existing. I just want to close my eyes and never open them again. I had it all and lost it all.

							I tend to have emotional issues.  Things in general are pretty good in my life, I have no family issues, I have a close friend, decent grades, a little lacking in the social/dating department, but that's okay.   But every now and then I'll have crying spells for no reason and I'll begin to think that I'm worthless and will never get anywhere in my life.  I just had a crying spell last night, cried myself to sleep over the fact that I can't think of any talents that I have.  It's over obviously petty stuff like that.  But it's only every now and then.  And on an almost constant basis I fantasize about how it would be if I killed myself, the people that would be at my funeral, and how I would want to be found.  But I never get close to do it, I never plan it out, I only think about it, and how it might be.  I know my parents and my friend would be upset so I'm sure I would never kill myself.  So, should I still seek professional help?  I feel most would just say to get over it and think positively.  I dunno.

I wanted to die in a way that would be comfortable to me but I can't do it right, so I have to do something more severe. Living with the failure is so impossible. To know that you can't even die correctly. Last week, I wound up running from the police for 2 days, because once my family found out what I had tried to do, they tried to have me hospitalized. As much as I don't want to live, I don't want to be imprisoned even more. So, I was homeless for two days. I have no idea where I'm going with this. I just wanted to say it and I can't speak this candidly with my therapist or I'll find myself on the run again. All I have now are scars to remind me of what I failed to do. Everyday I have to wake up and see them. Mocking me. I hate this.

I have now lost count, but I know it is somewhere over 30. Overdoses, strangulation, cutting, drowning, and you know what? On my last overdose, I was told my heart could stop. That scared me. So. Much. You do not want to die, deep down. It's not all it's cracked up to be. It's scary. It's horrible. It's "

							I wrote in my last post how i had dark thoughts and some of the time i would end up thinking about killing my ex. I guess to explain it further i was and still am obsessed. I didnt know what i know now about being obsessed so i wish i never was but i cant change the past. Its just being obsessed with your partner makes it really difficult when you break-up. I still to this day cant see myself being with anyone else. Its like completely blocked out. I still have to fight with myself to not do anything stupid because i still want to get back with her. I dont talk to her and really have no desire to because the person she is now isnt who she was when i was with her. Its just doesnt seem like i can get over how she used to be with me. I still am not able to deal with the fact that she has been with someone else. I still dont know how to deal with the fact that even when she is with him she still thinks about me. I know she isnt over me but she cant deal with it. I guess i knew i dont know anymore. I basically did everything i could to make the relationship work. I basically probably ended up doing everything on my own because it seemed like she didnt. I dont even know how to describe it but ill just say all the fights i had to work out between us. I had to basically know her better than she knew herself to know what she was thinking so i could know what she was thinking to figure out how to work things out."

					Rhetoric of hope, purpose, and control.  Rejection of an inevitable fate.
				","

							In all the world, in all that is knowable and predictable, in everything that can be touched, we search for purpose.  The pleasures of awareness are tempered with the demand to know why.  When the answer is clear, rational, and undeniable, emotion is the gift that allows us to look beyond utility.  Love provides the inspiration to not just carry on but to move forward with passion, true appreciation rather than mere acceptance.  It transforms a fleeting existence into a series of moments that may each become an eternity in and of themselves.  Who you are greatly surpasses what you leave behind or how others remember you because being human is not about standing out.  It is about being an integral part of a whole, a body, a community that won’t simply miss your absense but cease to be same without it.  While you are here, it’s your world, it’s everyone’s world, a place that can at any instant be shaped through either the passionate will of action or the disinterested glance of apathy.  No one who takes a single breath goes unnoticed or unknown.  We deceive ourselves with the delusion of beginnings and ends, absolutes and inescapable fates.  The only constant, the only inevitable conclusion is that things will change because they must.  Although hope may die, the possibilities and probabilities of which it was built never can.  The freedom to choose isn’t about controlling what happens next.  Choice is about imagining something in front of your eyes that is not there and perhaps never was.  Choice is about trying to touch that dream, if only for a second, with the attempt or trial meaning much more than actual accomplishment or failure.  Men are inspired less by outcomes than they are the struggles that precede them.  Die if you must but fight like hell before you do.

I turned my life around after going to a psych ward, a year later I turn into a heroin addict, JUST LIKE MY SISTER. I go to rehab and meet a girl that I completely fall in love with regardless of what they tell you about rehab romance, she doesn't feel the same way about me, she's got a kid, moves back in with her babys daddy. I was living in a sober living house and I moved back home and ended up getting high again. I don't really think it had much to do with her but more to do with  me hating myself. She has contacted me through email telling me she still cares about me even though her babys daddy won't let her talk to me. This douche calls me threatning to kill me and  *  *  *  *  if i don't stop talking to her. For some reason these past 3 weeks since i've moved home, I don't want to do anything, I dont even care about life. I've been staying sober only because my dad took all my money cuz he found track marks on my arm. I'm only 19 years old, but I feel hopeless I can't find the will to want to live, I think about ending it everyday, I can't deal with doing nothing everyday. I would love to talk to a therapist or a psychiatrist but i got dropped from my dads insurance because im not a student. I'd love to get a job but I'd rather sit here and stare at a wall all day. I really want to end it, I have nobody who can understand what i'm going through and nobody to talk to, I can't ask my dad for help again hes put my sister through rehab multiple times and me through institutions twice. I know it could be worst but i can't pick myself up, someone please help.

							I'll start this post with a little background information. Growing up, my dad was a mean, sometimes violent, always emotionally/verbally abusive alcoholic. When he wasn't completely sauced, he was a fun, likeable guy which left me torn between hating him and believing his harmful drunken rants. He met my mom in a foreign country and brought us to the States when I was around 4 so she had no family or friends at this time. They divorced when I was 7, but my dad continued to see me, pickinig me up on some weekends. I was terrified, still am terrified of him to this day. My mother has always been unavailable, favoring parties and time with her friends/boyfriends over me. Being an only child, my childhood years were very, very lonely. My mother often depended on me for emotional support, which bothered me, but the fact that it bothered me made me feel guilty. "

The people who know me don't know what to say and the people who do say something are insensitive jerks. I'm thinking about downing a bottle of booze and sleeping pills somewhere that my roommate won't have to stumble accross my body. If anyone has anything to say, feel free. But pedantic b.s. won't really make any difference and will probably solidify why I feel the way I do. I guess what I really need is a miracle.

I am suicidal, I am deeply depressed and I have been for a very long time. I have no friends left, I've no confidence and I hate myself. I've lived somewhat, but I am ashamed. I am ashamed of how my family and past friends view me (particularly how they would view me if they knew the whole story), and most of all I am ashamed of my own self and how I view myself. I have no excuse. There is no excuse for my depression and for my pathetic apathy and lack of dignity. I am 21 years old and all of the friends I've had are out together having fun, getting laid, meeting people, etc. And I am at home, with absolutely no interest in embarking on what would be such a pointless endeavor. All I remember is feeling alone my whole life, and being treated like less of a person. I have completely lost the will to live, and every day throughout my night dreams and day dreams I feel more and more capable of ending it all. I have been thoroughly depressed for as long as I can remember, perhaps longer, and over the past few years I have learned to hide it completely. I am more alone now than I've ever been in my life."

					Suicidal
				","

							Married for 25 years. I am wildly in love with my wife. We havent had sex for two years. 18 months ago she stoped sleeping with me. She told me she needed some space and that I was smothering her. Truly, I called her at lunch and in the evening to talk. Our children had just left the nest and I invisioned us growing closer with more time togeter. I complied and stopped calling her. She has always had low grade mental illness and I thought/think this has something to do with it. She was angry all the time for little things mainly with me (I scraped  the sidewalk with the lawnmower and she went ballistic). I got very sick and could bairly walk up stairs and was out of circulation for about six months (although I worked every day). I have tried very hard to be a good husband for these last 20 years. Early in our marrige I was unfaithful and I have lived ever day in deep remorse. I do most all the cooking, yardwork and clean up around the house. I make $500K and give every penny to her then ask for $20 if I need it. I am gentle and nonabusive, considerate and pasionate. I am told that I look like Mike Douglas. While I was sick she had an affair with one of my employees. She claims she was drunk and it was (I caught her having sex)  a one time deal. I believe that it is likely true although i found out she had been calling this guy on the phone at 2AM and talking for TWO hours. This woman   is the streightest arrow I have ever known. This is so unlike her and I know her not to be a lier that I am trying to believe her and get over it. However, she still wont sleep with me or hold my hand. She claims that she is so angry at men that she cant. Sometimes she cries the cry I have known for 28 years that is her cry while going off of the deep end/loosing it. I love this woman and would cut my arms off for her but I am so hurt. I waffle about every 15 minutes with killing myself. Around everone else she acts ""normal"". Around me I see the darkness. I dont see an end in sight. She wont go to counceling. Im beginning to loose it. I cant stand not to have her affection. She sleeps in the other room. I left her but she cried for me to come back. I did but still no physical contact. Im loosing my mind and am beginning to bang my head against the wall etc. I was never this way. I have no friends or family. She is all I have and want. She claims that she bottled up my affairs  for 20 years and is just now dealing with them. This is very crule. Almost 2 years alone. Please, what do you think? I am so lost. I bought a gun and had planned to kill myself on christmas day in front of her but she was so kind to me that day that I had a change of heart. Please ladies what is going on in her mind? She wont talk. Her attitude is that if I can just be cool and wait someday it might be alright. Im trying but as time drags on Im geting worse. Ive seen doctors and Im on medication but its not working. There is no medicine for a broken heart.

So, December 30th is the next leaving date and I've got nothing. Best of all, this time, I'll be totally alone so I won't have the problem of being found before I'm totally gone. My one regret is that my mother is going to end up being the one who finds me. I really didn't want it to be her. The last time I tried to make so my brother would find me and take care of things before my mother got home but he found me a little too early. *sigh Well, life you've got 6 more days to prove to me you're worth it.

My life has no meaning, I looked for the positives, and I can't really find much. I am always misunderstood about things I say, said or will say. Everyone hates me and I don't know why. The thoughts of going to a shrink and pour my heart out terrifies me. I can't afford it anyway.... all who to used to be my best friends either disappeared or moved to other countries. If I'm so great at understanding and helping other people in their tough times, why is my life so miserable and my existence is meaningless.. if I pass will anyone even care, will they even know? I had it, I had enough of a life like this. Professional help? I don't even know if I'll have any money in 2 weeks time. What's going on? Why? I'm normally very together, but right now nothing makes any sense and the idea of sleeping forever is so appealing. There's a normal, decent, kind and caring person inside me somewhere I'm sure, but why can't anyone see? I really don't know how I will get through this, but I guess I will, maybe.

					Why can't I just die?
				","

							I've been on here before, everyone promised me that things would get better.  Well they didn't and became not only severely depressed but so obsessed with killing myself that nearly every second of the day was consumed by wishing to be dead.  I would drive to work and it would take all my strength not to wreck my car.  At work I'd be cruising suicide boards looking for what I call ""deathspiration"".  No one understood me and I essentially pushed everyone away.  Well Friday, Nov. 21 I was on a one stop mission to end my life.  I remember driving home, the day so beautiful and I just hated the fact I couldn't even enjoy it because I knew I was going to be dead.  I bought my favorite dinner, loaded up on enough alcohol for days, and proceeded to go home and carry out my plan.  I won't say exactly what I did because I won't encourage suicide methods, but my roomate walked in on me just in time and took me to the hospital.  I was admitted to the psych ward and barely conscious as I basically Baker Acted myself into the system.  "

I have trust issues and have only talked to a few people about my situation. When i am depressed, thoughts of suicide always enter my mind. I am a very impulsive person, so i dont think before i do anything. out of the friends i have told, i am not feeling any support. the feedback i get is that i am just going through something and i need to get over it, or i want attention. Those people once told me that they would be there for me whenever i needed them and now they are walking away. The other two people i told, i am unable to contact since they joined the airfoce. I dont know what to do. I live with people i once thought were my best friends and now i feel like i am just nothing. i try so hard to keep my thoughts away from suicide but how do you get over this when the poeple who are supposed to be there for you arent?

It has recently gotten bad and I get sick of it personally.  He has an online g/f and when I read stuff like 'if you shoot yourself i shoot myself' (we don't actually have any guns) it really pisses me off.  He says 'you don't get it.  you don't know anything about romance'.  Is that really 'romantic'?  Seems to me girls don't really like the guys that are down on themselves all the time.

							I'm so tired of 'life' and I just want it to end. I'm 29 and I have no friends. I quit my job this time last year and went to Oz as a last attempt at doing something worthwhile and it was a bit lonely but a good experience at the time. My one best friend then also travelled at the same time and we met up out there but he came back in July and moved to the city. I came home mid September and have been trying for jobs up there but not getting anything. I've been back 3 months and my 'friend' has only got in touch twice during that time just to ask for a book back! I've just seen on his Facebook that he's been to Amsterdam for a few days with a couple of friends and I didn't even know that he was going let alone be asked. He's moved on and met new people and even though I've known him for 9 years, I've been pushed to the sidelines for better people. In my old job I tried to socialise with my work colleagues but because I'm reasonably quiet and not a drinker I was excluded and the guys used to go out and not invite me or go out during the weekend and I'd find out all about their hilarious anecdotes on the Monday which made me feel utterly worthless. I was asked out on a Saturday night by a couple of guys I got to know through my friend but I was a bit quiet and I haven't heard from them since and have stopped being invited. I am so lonely. I loathe New Years - the past decade I've spent two in the company of someone, the rest I'm on my own close to tears sitting in my house while my parents are off with their friends celebrating. I can just imagine all the people I know partying and laughing with their friends and I'm just on my own. I arrived back from Oz in September and I came back to silence. My parents greeted me in the airport but there were no text messages or calls saying 'You've been gone 8 months, great to have you back, night out to catch up' etc as there is no-one. I felt so sad. I've got no job, no friends and no life just wandering around the house seeing all my youth - my 20's just gone under a load of misery. Even a couple of people I met in Oz I've e-mailed and have had no response. I just want to end it - no-one wants to know me apart from my parents but I haven't even got the guts to kill myself. It hurts so badly inside.

							Its been awhile that ive been dealing with being really suicidal and most of the time all i wanted was for it to go away. I couldnt believe i was gettin like that because for whatever reason i always tried to do anything to not end up like my family. I didnt really understand that my family had a history of suicide attempts or mental problems. Alot of stuff just started to happen to me really fast and my life just started to get really bad. I used to think that it would get better or that it wouldnt get any worse but i soon learned that there was really no end to how bad things could get. Ive basically have been living in a life crisis where everything just seemed to be going bad. I just describe it as basically living with the worst thing happening to u that you could imagine but it kept happening to u everyday. I guess that basically is my ex breaking up with me and doing it in a pretty evil way. Ive come to some terms with it but its still too painful. It was like my bubble that i lived in growing up completely bursting and me seeing things for what they really are. I cant even go into my childhood too much because its still too depressing to me but it was just filled with loneliness and alot of pain that i couldnt deal with. I just know that i used to always feel like things would get better for me as i got older but ive learned that it actually got alot worse. I guess life usually does before it gets better but that just had me waiting for it to get better."

							I'm trapped again.  I only live for my kids.  A fallout is about to happen because I can't hold it together at work anymore.  I have to drop out before I make a huge mistake, accidently hurt someone and get fired.  In the meantime, I get that pissy, annoying husband nagging at me every day and I can't stand it.  I want to hide and to get away.  I'm left with no energy to properly engage my kids, who are so fun and sweet.  They don't deserve this.  I don't want to dump any garbage on them.  I hold it in and think about how I need to keep holding it in until maybe a year after my youngest graduates college and becomes established, and both kids, as they should, move on in their lives.  It will be lonely for me, but it's the right thing for them.  I just fear that I will have no purpose left and will be seriously suicidal.  If I didn't have them now, I may have left myself to quietly starve to death alone.  No one would check on me if I were divorced and quit work.  I've never had a happy break in life.  Child abuse, I was just an annoying extra kid in the way, growing up in a cult religion then realizing that god is not real, suddenly dead boyfriend when life was turning up, abusive husband, abusive divorce, struggle to go to grad school on my own and support my kids, no money for heat or food for a while, string of getting used and abused by more men, antidepressants didn't work, settling for a ""safe"" husband who is now pissy and nagging, stressful, exhausting work in an environment where I can't do anything right, and guilt at not having enough of myself to give my deserving children.  I want to just give up.  I want to check into a mental hospital, but my children will be marked and scarred and my ex will  have to begrudgingly become reinvolved in my children's lives and have more reason for criticism of me.  There's no way out, so I'll just drink to take the edge off, disengage from the world, keep trying to give what I have left to my kids and wait it out until my kids move on.  Then the scary, redeeming time of relief might happen.  Maybe I'll crash my car in a tree so my kids won't be hurt by the idea of suicide and guilt of not helping.  I don't want them to know anything.  I just want to be free and I want to set them free.  I must drag them down and I can't barely help it.  These are the desperate, panicky thoughts that choke me.  I'm very quiet and almost didn't send this, but I just need to let this out and be heard so I can hang on another day.

							great words from snoop dogg, ""life is a bi*ch and then u die."". So far this has been true to me. Nothing brings me pleasure, i feel empty, worthless, some people may call it depression, but im just saying it how it is. Im being honost with myself. The only thing preventing me from dying is because it would crush my moms heart. It is considered ""selfish"" to take my own life because I am hurting the few people who actually care about me. Well when am i going to start doing things that r better for me and not for other people. The good in life doesnt outweight the bad so whats the point. Sure life can be great if ur smart, good looking, charismatic, charming, hard working... but im none of these things. For me, i have already passed the prime of my life, when i was a kid. Not a care in the world i could just have a good time, not worry about money, girls, careers, school, me... those days r long gone. I am 19 and life has been worse every day. Whats the point of living this bad life if ur just going to die anyways. Why not speed up the process? Because I am going to burn in hell if I kill myself?? Well, i dont believe and god, and if he is real, then he is cruel and i wouldnt want to be in his presense in heaven. I just dont know what to do anymore, I could change things, but it just doesnt seem like its worth the trouble. Once i fix my current problems which will take a long time and will be a terrible process, im just going to have more problems to deal with. Its a never ending cycle, until u die at least. So y not die now? I wish i was never born... i was an accident anyways so maybe i wasnt supposed to be here.

							k, not one to be short winded, ask me the time i will tell u how to build a clock, so this may be a long one.  not really use to being alone.  nvr have been.  really weird after 43 years but what can i say.  realized to night after some drink and a long very cold walk that is not the alone that bothers me, it is the empty.  not sure when this occurred.  think it was early.  dad died when i was young.  can rem when i was somewhere around 10 or 11 laying on the couch and closing my eyes and seeing how he must have felt with the trees towering over him, the world seen thru a grey tent.  the world kept going, while he stayed still.  he was watching the world pass by.  i didn't want him to be alone.  would lay on the couch and wish i was with him.  well time has passed by.  have been through a marriage of 10 years with 3 children, a relationship immediately after that yielded 2 children.  ages of all 15,13,11,10,8.  trying to finish my second marriage now, in the final troughs of divorce.  no children with this most recent one.  which brings me to the moment.  i really dont like it here anymore.  think back i haven't for a very very long time now.  first time in my life i have lived alone but realized only minutes ago it is not the alone so much as the empty.  and i really dont wish to be  filled, just crushed and thrown away.  not something i would ever do myself.  got 2 many ppl that depend on me.  i dont like to let ppl down.  as a reflex i reach out to ppl, not sure y.  strangers, friends, it doesnt matter and i have no choice in the situation.  if i find someone it true need i Have to do what i can to help.  but i dont like it here anymore.  really wish i could go now.  only choice 4 me is to pray i could be taken now but i cant leave my kids again and dont think the prayer would be answered anyway.  none live with me.  so im really stuck.  i have no idea how i got here!  i just really want it to end.  tired of hurting, it gets old.  would b dif if i could see some light, or see a turn i could take.  but its really dark here right now, no light shining thru.  been here for a bit now.  been a long time since i was somewhere that felt like home.  really dont care where it is, i just want to go home!

					new to this, just need to talk i guess
				","

							hello, i just found this site. where to start??? ive always felt some kind of urge,or want, to end my life. as of now most of the feeling comes from my situation in life. im currenty married but because of my mental diagnosis, i had to move back in with my parents. that was a huge step back for me. i think that my wife is ok with it though, she seemed pretty unhappy with the marriage since ive been diagnosed. i some times wonder if shes happy its like this, or if shes planning a divorce. its a cluster F*@$. my diagnosis is       bipolar1, not that big of a deal consitering that almost half of the US goes through this disorder in one way or another. however it does mess me up alot, especially when you add that to my social anxiety and paranoid delusional percetions. just trying to find new ways to deal with all of this makes me want to throw in the towel. it feels like i have the weight of it all on my back, and plus i have to find a way to make it all work. i cant even figure out what to put on in the morning, how do i solve al those problems too? it gets me so worked up sometimes that i end up doing somthing stupid. i have over 19 burn marks on my body, believe me im not proud of any of them. its embarrassing i dont swim anymore or take my shirt off. i dont know why i feel the urge to do it, but when i get really low or in a mood it seems to just happen. i guess i see it like, no one else cares so why should i. i hate it the most when i get tired and know im going to fall asleep, because i know that all my dreams are going to be about horrible things or, they tease me killing me slowly, slowly. then bam im awake. i hate sleep the most. i think that every person has the right to do what they want with their body, mind and soul. its up to them to do what they want with it, so how can anyone else make that decesion for them. i just dont get it i guess.

					I failed
				","

							A bout a month ago I tried to kill myself but before I died my brother found me and I found myself in the hospital. I can say that sometimes things just aren't meant to happen. I planned out my death, seemingly perfectly and still failed. What I did learn is that no matter how anyone thinks killing themselves is going to be, it's likely going to be far more intense than you though. It was absolutely terrifying and I really had to sit and work up the courage to actually do it. Now that I've tried and failed I find I face a world of other problems I wasn't expecting to face. I have to begin to rebuild myself financially because I blew through a lot of money the weekend before. I've had to face my family and explain things to them. *sigh I'm not even sure why I'm writing this. I guess I just felt I should share it.

,"

							I have to admit that I think about suicide daily; as I age the thoughts come more frequently. There seem to be a plethora of reasons; the physical (insomnia), the mental/emotional; that I feel utterly empty; feel is the wrong word since that would imply the presense of something that is absent. As I have gotten older I have noticed the changes. Usually I can put on a smile for other people (my encounters with others are of such limited duration as to permit such), but it is disingenuous at heart. I don't feel like smiling, nor frowning; I just don't feel. It is usually at the height of this deadened vacuum of soulessness that I feel most compelled and controlled by feelings of suicide. For me it could happen any day; it not something to plan out; it will likely just happen. Though I am empty I yet retain a conscious which reminds me that I should not be by dint of the very fact that I supposed to be human; even pain is better than nothingness, though I suppose it is a sort of pain, a dull, ever present throbbing which whittles away at my soul and devours hope; it is a wasting away. I feel utterly alone. I do not express this outwardly. As I have said, I usually smile and lie to the world; in truth the world does not wish for anything but a lie; it loves the farce. Happiness is contagious as the saying goes and thus it is impressed upon me that I should show some semblance of this dismally unclear and vacuous term, I should rather be the thespian than the honest man; if I do not feel 'content' I ought not to show it. All the world tells me this. Laugh and the whole world laughs with you, cry and and you cry alone. I was recently reminded of this (as I am numerous times under such circumstances) during a conversation with one of my progenitors who told me rather eerily as she had some years ago that if I am to call her (them) I should only bear good tidings lest I infect them with some sort of depression and melancholy. I thought it strange that a comment such as 'the UK is incredibly expensive' should elicit such as response but there you have it. Then came the when I was your age...well, I need not clarify that. Clearly my progenitors perceive me as a failed experiment in terms of progeny and how sad it must be for them given that I am an only child. The only continuation of their DNA and the specimen is a wretched failure. I mention this because it dovetails well with the constant and to my mind farcical claim that 'people love you'; this is laughable to me. I know that no one loves me and though there are those who could drink a cup of coffee with me for an hour or so I hardly could call that love or caring. I contest the idea that people love me and still more fiercely I cannot find agreement with the idea that people care; I have lived in over 7 countries and travelled the world and what I have seen is not caring; people do not care; they are inherently selfish and self-interested and who can blame them; they are genetically programmed to be so. All I see is cruelty, exploitation and destruction and the result, empnitness. It is for this reason that I know that no one would bat an eyelash at my passing. Perhaps some people truly love and if so I know and have felt nothing of this 'love'. When I am gone the world shall still turn and those who knew me shall have a brief flicker of recollection and quickly go about their business as the conscious or unconscious realisation of my irrelevance dawns upon them, in truth no epiphany at all but merely that, which had always been true, both in life and in death. Certainly upon reading this there will be those among you who will offer protestations of 'caring' which I can only perceive as behavioural conformity to established norms: you have to say you care, whether you do or don't (you don't). You are preprogrammed to offer such platitudes as a response. I dream daily the dream of Prince Hamlet. I simply see no reason, none whatsoever and each day I desire to render an end to this dim and hollow pain, which is no pain in itself but rather a distinct nothingness, as paradoxical as it sounds. I can find no better description for the 'condition'. A sure and painless way; that seems difficult. I don't think there is a sure way. Pain in this respect seems inevitable though I should hope it will be brief and then no longer dim, ill described emptiness but true nothingness; I shall cease to exist and for all the world it shall be as this has always been true.

							Ive been more suicidal because before it was like my mind couldnt stop thinking about it. It was almost like everyday my mind would just think of different ways to kill myself. I really havent been able to talk or open up about alot of stuff eventho ive wrote and said so much in my past posts. Its just with my fear of abandonment and my fear of rejection its like i get really anxious about opening up. I guess on top of that the only person i was ever close with and trusted was probably the person that ended up hurting me more than anyone could ever do. I really dont know how i could have fallen in love with someone like that but it just seems like it was just meant to be. I was born in an abusive household and it just had an effect on me. I just feel like the closer or the longer things go on the worse it gets. Its like i have so many thing in my mind that are blocked out because i cant cope with them. Ive been trying to deal with memory loss because when my first relationship was over all my memory from that time in my life was blocked out. I guess on top of that when i met my ex it was like i couldnt remember anything before that so for awhile my memory was completely gone besides my ex breaking up with me. So i guess for about a week thats all i could think about but somehow i had to basically rip myself from being consumed by that. Ive read that somehow people can die from heartbreak and i feel like i dont know how i couldnt be any closer to something like that happening."

I feel like im gonna talk about my time with being suicidal. its pretty weird because alot of people dont even get why you would be suicidal so i dont really know how you would support someone or help them in anyway if you see it like its not supposed to be the way you see it. Ive heard alot of people say this is a forum so i do understand that and its not the same as getting professional help but at least for me sometimes it does bother me that some people might say certain things and almost add to the problem. I will say that eventho i said it bothers me that doesnt mean that it has to be the same way for everyone. It doesnt bother me that ppl will argue and i dont feel like most people will get what im saying."

							I'd like to thank everyone who expressed care and concern for me these past few weeks. Both here and in the self harm forum. This time tomorrow I won't be here. It serendipitous that, everyone I pushed out of my life showed up randomly this weekend. It gave me a chance to see them, tell them things, and say good bye, in my own way. It felt like fate wanted me to see them one last time. I don't feel as afraid as I did last time. I feel good. I am worried about pain a little but it makes me laugh to think that this will be that last time I'll ever hurt. Again, I'd like to thank everyone who wrote encouraging things to me and offered advice. I genuinely did give thought to everything you all said, I just chose to go another route. I hope everyone who comes here looking for help here, in the future, finds comfort in the words given by the caring people on these boards. I hope everyone who may read this knows that just because I gave up it doesn't mean you have to or should. Keep talking to people. Keep looking for answers. Find that one steady hope to hold onto and build from. Good luck everyone and good bye.

I don't want to keep living like this but no one seems to be able to help me. I don't know what to do I'm at a dead end all I want to do is die and that feeling keeps getting stronger. I used to be able to tell myself that everything will get better and make myself believe it.

Im getting bad grades and my parents said they wont help me pay for college unless I get good grades..and Im going to be done with high school by june. My parents recently read all of my online conversations and they read about me talking about some drugs I did and read about me calling my dad an a-hole and all this other stuff. My parents earlier this year caught me smoking cigarettes and they think I just started, even though I've done it for 3 years. If I wasnt addicted, I would've stopped, but I cant. I've tried. I got fired from my job that I enjoyed and am now at a terrible job with long hours and low pay. I drink alcohol about every weekend and get drunk every weekend. I almost got in trouble with the cops for it twice in a month. I've gone into this terrible way of living and looking at things, that it's become a habit I can not stop. Has anyone felt like this? Anyway, I dont wanna hear the same old speech about how it is wrong to kill yourself. I was just wondering if anyone knows any painless ways to kill yourself or least painful ways compared to other.

							ive been extremely depressed before. two years ago, i had some problems and i did not get out of the house for 8 month, i was constantly hurting myself and i could not snap out of it, no one was there for me, i did not want to meet anyone, depression makes u do that, i woke out of depression because of my bf but right now i feel he is better without me, i feel he doesnt love me anymore and he knows im in a depression and cant do anything about it. i know i had my faults...so tell me what happeneds when u become the main source of pain for the one you love? i am so damn sure he wants to end the relationship but he is afraid im going to get to depressed because of that. anyway i dont have any friends, i cant talk to anyone i dont wanna be here on earth, i rly have no reason to live, i am useless here...u know what he told me when i told him that? he said: you are too sensitive for this world. ...maybe that's why i should not be here, if i could only find a way to do it quickly and painlessly id do it this second and no one would rly know i did it. no one would care, everyone would just go back to their lovely lives and forget about me, anyway all ive done was make everyone hurt and miserable, anyway i still love my bf and i rly hope if i die him to be happier. anyway being another year in a depression, i cant stand that thats for sure, and there are no chances for me getting better.  i wont ask here how can i kill myself painlessly because i wont get an answer to that., only replies like you should not give up etc etc...thanks for listenin

					Im just tired of writing about this
				","

							I havent had anything bad happen to me that was like crazy but i dont feel like ive ever felt this bad. Ive been in more pain, more depressed, more anxiety, but probably not more tears. I basically cryed my eyes out today. it was like some type of release of just a build up of so many things. Its like i dont want to die and i have things that keep me on that side but then its just like for the most part i dont care. I just see myself slipping more and more into that part. Its just i honestly dont care how bad it gets i dont feel like i would ever kill myself. Its just i always think about how i wish i could just die and just get over with this. Its been a long life and i like who i am but i cant describe in words how much i hate my life. I wish i could scream at the top of my lungs until my head popped off with just how much i hate and am sick and tired of my life. I basically just have stopped caring. Ive always gotten to this point where things get so bad that i cant do anything but be indifferent. I once used to joke around about how when it was a crazy time in the world with the wars , weather, and everything just seemed to be going down hill, that i wish i could just sit down and i would just watch the world end and laugh because of how stupid some people are. It blows my mind all the time. Its like girls at my job working and my boss is flirting with them and hes a married man but they like it because they get off on his power and probably how hes an older man. It always made me sick and i really thought that people in this world would be more like that but for the most part i feel like no one really cares. I could just write and write about how much i hate this world but even if i tried i dont really know what i would like or even love. I would have said love is a beautiful thing but because of what ive gone thru its like i despise it with my whole broken heart. Ive basically dont even feel that part of my body anymore."

							Im really hurt, my dad who was 50 od with sleeping pills, he wanted to die. And her receptionist said, that the day before he was writing a letter while he was crying. My dad suffered a really bad motorcycle accident about 1 year ago and he hurt his arm, (all the nerves were pulled) so he cant move it. And he got kind of fat. He was living with my uncles because of the accident and because my parents are divorced. And owned a furniture shop. The store was very good for about 2 to 3 years, but after the accident it all went downhill, so he had decided two close the store (2 days before the od). I have a little brother 12 years old, and me, and i just ask myself, ¿why didn't he ask for help, didn't he care about my brother and i?, he was so selfish, and didn't care about the scars he was going to leave me just so he could end his pain, and leave my mother with school debts and house debts, he was going rto hand the problem to us!!! I'm 16 years old and in high school, so i wonder, ¿what would have happened if he had succeeded? Im  just really hurt and wanted to tell someone, because i have a lot of cousins and aunts, but i dont have any trust with them, because my dad and mom where always the ones with problems and i was the poor child with the disfunctionjal family, so i dont like the pitty my family will give me, it just makes me feel powerless.

					A Dream I had

							I don’t know if this is the right thread, but my older brother died 18 years ago when I was a kid.  Last night, after many years of not even thinking about it, I had a dream where my brother was asking me about my life since he died and he wanted me to catch him up on everything.  He was genuinely interested in even the most mundane details.  He explained that he was away because he ""had to be"" and I understood though he didn't elaborate.  It was soo good to talk to him.  When I woke up, I realized it was only a dream and that made me very sad.  I just thought it was strange since I hadn't thought of him in years.  I miss him and would have liked to know what he would have become in life had he not given up when he was so young.

I basically just vented like crazy because i felt like i was going to go crazy or i already was and couldnt help myself just say what i was going thru because of how painful it was. I feel like today i really lost it. Ive been basically battling myself because of how she broke up with me and also lost her virginity to someone else but says it should of been me but she says she would have never have sex with me, thats the mind of an abused person. Its just now im that abused person because of how bad she neglected me and emotionally abused me. I can only describe the pain she left me in as being raped and now i constantly struggle with myself because in my mind i feel like i would want to rape her to show her what it felt like for her to do what she did to me. I never talk about any of the stuff im going to talk about because i have abandonment issues and dont trust people and on top of what my ex did to me i dont see how im going to be able to trust ppl again."

I had a beautiful g/f that somehow wanted to be with me but I was stupid and kept pushing her away because my illness was making this relationship not work so I requested a break until I'm better but she doesn't see that. This has prevented me from living life to the fullest, this illness is ruining me. Every single day it feels as if my brain is ""off"" and there's no way to turn it back on. "

Dont know why or where this idea was put into my head but it worries me that one day ill convince myself that the pro's out-weigh the cons. I think about just driving out somewhere desolate and downing pills or slicing my wrist. When im driving i'll have a freakishly real day dream of just tugging the wheel into traffic or off a cliff. It really scares me that i think if i die ill live in the perfect dream for ever. Even more scary is that it humbles me somewhat.

							I dont want to make a post with all my difficulties, I will just try getting to the point. Yesterday I woke up with no will to live at all. I went through the whole day feeling completely dead inside, I coudn't concentrate on anything else I had to do. That is funny, just about the last 3 or 4 days ago I was feeling fine and now I feel like the garbage of the universe. This behavior is convincing me each time more that I am depressed, I never went to a doctor to confirm it, but Im pretty sure about that. And like you should be thinking by now, I am very tempted to take my life. I wont try to write here about all the things that I believe are making me feel like this, but I think I can summarize them into one thing: lack of courage. When I think about my life I realize that in about 95% of the situations I went through in it I acted in a cowardly way. What bugs me is that I am really devastaded when I see so many things I could have done/said differently, but these are chances that I wont have again.....and the worst thing is that I dont see things getting better in the future.....I am 21 years old and I have noticed that courage is my problem just recently, I feel now that I havent enjoyed the period that I was a teenager at all......with such fears like being rejected, having no friends, being alone making me stand still and do nothing........and these things that scared me so much in the end came to happen   people, can someone give me a word of cheer or hope? I really need it....

I've had suicidal thoughts and I can't stop...I don' think I'd ever have the ability to do anything but I want my depression and suicidal thoughts to go away. I've never had a best friend and the only person who has come close told me straight up that I would never be her best friend. I'm about to lose my boyfriend he says i need to ""take some responsibility for my  *  *  *  * ing self"" but I don't know what that means I'm a very responsible person I pay my bills, I've got a job I just have no friends. I'm tired I was supposed to die when I was born and I wish so hard that I would have but because I can't change the past I try to slowly kill myself with cigarrettes. I don't know how to make friends. How do you make friends? how do you meet random people is it stupid to go up to someone and ask them to be your friend? I am so lame. I just wanted to see if anyone else had the same issues that they feel they're life is going no where and that there is no point cause that's how i feel i just want to sit around and smoke out. I want to laugh like i used to and I can't find it anymore.....it's like my whole being has changed into someone i don't recognized. Does anyone know of a psychiatrist or therapist chat room? ](*,)

I've been dealing with severe depression for years now and these last five years have been torture and my little dog was the ONLY thing who could cheer me up.  I live in a place where I don't belong and have one friend here.  I haven't had a real job in five years and now I am supposed to start one on Monday, but I am in such pain over losing my beloved little dog that I just don't know if I can."

					Tired of being human.

							What's the point of it all? I sit here examining my life; past, present, future and I find it all rather useless. Looking at it from a metaphysical sense, there is no real point. I have no issues with that, what I do has as much destiny or purpose as anything else; mainly none. So, removing the metaphysical ""what's the purpose of life"", what standard should I set myself against? Lacking the metaphysical, lets use the natural world. At its basest level, life has two primary functions; survive and procreate. Everything else is built around these two functions, the only thing that changes are the buzzwords and spin we put on them. These are the standards I will be using to examine my life."

					Confessions of a college dropout
				","

							I am trying to remain stronger..I have tried to not disappoint my parents but nothing is working out for me... I have done everything they have wanted me to do. Attending college was what they wanted from me so I attended...The reason I attended was because I was tired of the abuse from my father...The hitting stopped but I hate the way he talks to me and makes me feel like I don't matter. Needless to say I messed up my first year of college and they knew I messed up...I wasn't going to college to learn I was using it as an escapism...it was my freedom..all i did was party, I finally had a social life.I was so happy with complete strangers, being with my own family felt like a chore. I started to look for love from men I met on campus, I let them have their way with me anything to feel love. I didn't know what love from a man was like I didn't know what to expect. I fell for the games, I didn't know any better. I let them use me thinking that I was using them. My grades eventually started to have their ups and downs, mostly downs. My parents would ask to see my grades and I had figured out how to work the system. I figured out how to change my grades, basically feeding them b.s. They never questioned it, never asked to read a paper, nothing. So the b.s. continued and I was dismissed from the university, I began to attend a community college still traveling up north in the area of the university. The community college would send bills to my parents house and they never asked me about, they never questioned me. This bothered me more than anything..I wanted them to confront me, yell at me..but I got nothing. They kept telling everyone I was still at the university, still on the dean's list. They lived a lie and still do and so did I. Recently I have given up, I don't care about school, I don't have that desire to learn. I want to leave it all behind...travel Europe or kill myself are the options I have given myself. I put kill myself with everything. The thing that keeps me from doing is the hurt I would cause my sister and friends. I don't want them to go through that. I don't know why I'm here..I wonder why I'm here everytime someone dies...I wonder why not me....                                                  "

							There are winners and losers.  Some are good players and some are bad players.  I happen to be a loser and a bad player.  I've tried to ignore these feelings and keep on going but it's becoming difficult.  Thankfully, the choice of suicide will become easier in the near future.  Once my mother and dog dies, I really have nothing to feel guilty about by ending it all.  No other close family that will care much.  No girlfriend/wife.  No friends.  I'm alone as it is.  I'm not about to go on completely alone.  So I'll just suck it up for the next 5, 7, 10, 15 years and just pull the trigger.  "

Ive had trouble dealing with stuff that i really just feel like i cant deal with because its too painful. Its been so much much happening to me since all of this happened. I dont even know if people can help me because my whole life ive always seen that the stuff i go thru no one really knows what to do or say because its just beyond crazy. I think im gettin worse because before i would just have suicidal thoughts but i would try to just let them happen when they would or find some way to stop myself from ever let them be more than just thoughts. Its just now it seems like its more serious like im thinking about how i would do it and i know when u start to plan it thats just about as bad as it gets before it can get any worse. I just feel like my whole life must be some type of sick joke. I grew up without any type of relationship with my parents but i always tried to stay positive saying at least it wasnt a bad one. Its just growing up like that i have so much of what i want in life is to have a happy family or at at least a family that functions. Its just my whole life ive tried to find anyway to get away from my family or do whatever i could to not end up like them. So now i see thats not going to happen because im going thru all the things ive tried my whole life to stop from happening. So i try to take the good from that which im alittle bit more understand of what made them like that but its so depressing to realize that whatever i tried to do couldnt help me to stop from going thru this."

My newly ex husband left me 2.7 years ago and I received my divorce decree in the middle of May.  He just married the woman he left me for last week.  I have been through therapy and a support group for it and I have accepted that he has left.  I just don't have a life to move on to.  I have high moral standards and I did not date one person while we were separated.  Now I am free and men are not attracted to me.  They act weird around me and it does not matter how friendly I am.  I don't want to go on about this because it is not my only focus.  I am working but barely making ends meet.  I have a painful condition called RSD that prevents me from being able to go out and do the things I used to love before my accident in 1999.  I am alone 90% of the time that I am outside of work.  I go and see my parent's and siblings about once or twice a month but no one comes out to see me (I am half hour away from them)  I have a few friends but they have busy lives and no time to see me.  So is this all there is for me?  Going to work to just be able to survive but I am in so much pain from my condition that I can't do a lot of things anyway.  Just go to work and come home alone for the rest of my life.  I wanted to join a local singles group but it cost money and they do a lot of activties that I can't do anyway.  I have looked into EVERYTHING you can think of to try to survive in this miserable world and I am so tired and can't do it anymore.  I am not successful, am barely surviving, in pain all of the time and no man will ever want me as is.  What is there to live for?

I haven’t been hugged since I was six and I’m practically destroyed or ignored by my peers.

All my aunts and uncles that i grew up with all have attempted suicide. Its weird i feel like my whole life was the same rerun of like a real life horror movie or something. I never grew up being abused but my family was i guess. Also my mom once told me that every guy that she has been with has been abusive. Thats pretty hard to hear how now shes in her 40's. I dont really have a support system and ive never had anyone to talk to about my problems. Ive had to become my own therapist, my own best friend, my own motivator, my own coach in life. "

I have dreams that I'm with people and of this one person I used to love or of even some anonymous man who loves me and of beautiful places - then I wake up to the disaster that is my existence.  I wake up wondering how I ended up in this spot and I've no idea how to change things at this point.  I feel hopeless for the future and I think of just giving up and drinking wine to blot the pain, if only for another day.  No, I actually do that.  It works while I do it, but of course then I wake up and it's just another day.

							Why can't life be like it was when we're young? When things weren't quite as complicated and people tended to be a little nicer and less hurtful, or if they were hurtful we weren't old enough to understand what they were saying was hurting us? I don't want this to be some angsty letter, but why does life turn out this way, when the only way of esaping the pain is to end it and keep it from coming back. And if it is such a nice escape why do people get so upset and not happy that they aren't hurting anymore? this is always such a negative subject. Yes it's         yourself, but when you're in so much pain what much other choice do we have left? I think so often about this, and have wondered why I'm not      yet. Any attempt I've survived. I don't want to be here, but I'm so afraid of people being sad. I don't want to hurt other people by doing this. I'm hurt, I'm broken, I'm alone, I want someone to tell me it will be alright, that I don't have to kill myself to end this hurt. I don't know what to do with myself anymore. I really don't want to kill myself, but it seems like it's the only way to end this. Please, someone just tell men things will get better. that getting my heart ripped out, it will still come back. That after being abused, it will stop. that after the name ccalling and bullying, they will learn to love. that even though it seems like no one cares, that there is someone out there who gives a flip wether I'm alive or not.

I always think about killing my self to end all the pain but i dont want to leave my parents with any burden. i feel like no one wants me around and my family has told me multiple times to just kill myself, especially my sister. i dont really have any friends, the only one i did have was my cousin but she no longer wants to be friends with me because my sister has drove her away. now i feel like im all alone in this world. i dont know why they hate me so much i try my best to be a good kid. I dont do drugs, i work full time to pay for school and all my expenses, i am a straight A student in pre med school and i get told all the time that i am an attractive girl. i just want to make them happy so i can be happy for once. i really cant take it anymore and i am just wondering what others would do in my situation or how should i deal with this...maybe killing my self is the best option.

					I don't think I'll ever do it, but I am thinking about it...

							...and it's mainly because I found out through the internet that my ex is now seeing someone after only 7-9 months of being broken up with me. I discovered this first through seeing a FaceBook image of her, and then I called her to get something back of mine, but while I had her on the phone I asked her if she was seeing someone else and she said yes."

					gotta make some serious changes
				","

							I see suicide in my future unless i make changes in my life, the point i've been at the two years in life have led me closer and closer to suicide, i've hit rock bottom in many aspects of my life. Basically i've got issues which i really hate and that bother me, and i haven't quite figured out what to make of them or how to solve them, anyway the idea that i can figure my self out and change my life and my ways to find happiness is keeping me going at this point, the thing is i see my future as going two ways, succeeding or failing, im either going to work out my issues and find some direction, or else im gonna find myself at the same place i am now 10 years from now, if that the case i definitely see suicide as happening. I know its never an answer to problems but if in fact my life looks the same as it does now, if my issues are still unresolved and i still cant find happiness well then i will commit suicide simply because i dont want my life anymore, its wont be that im trying to solve my problems at that point if no progress has been made on my part i wouldnt see them as problems anymore just facts of my life that wont change, if thats the case well then i truly dont want to live as me anymore. I hope that doesnt happen and i wish i had the optimism to say that I KNOW! its not gonna be the case because i wont let it! unfortunately life continues to remind me that its real, not some fairytale where hard work is always rewarded and good people always prosper, the real world consists of good people getting hit by cars and evil people making millions, theres really no moral balance or guidelines to how the hands in life are dealt, sometimes your given a bad hand, sometimes your given a good hand, sometimes you can turn a bad hand into a good hand, sometimes you can work all your life to change your bad hand into a good one but realize that it doesnt always workout, the world has no balance or fairness, Karma is BS, fundamentalist are dreamers, wake up, life is living,moving, organic, its doesnt play by rules or ideas or romantic words, it goes where ever its pushed, im sorry im so cynical today, but my life is very cynical

					I keep thinking about it...
				","

							Firstly, im not going to commit suicide. So, please dont worry or anything. I will keep posting! I will stick around. Even if i didn't, it doesn't matter anyway-you don't know me, and it is not your duty. Still, im not going anywhere.......i really want to see The Dark Knight for starters. However, i can't stop thinking about death. I've reached a point where i don't see the point of life anymore. Almost as if life itself is just nothing in comparison to the scheme of things overall. I keep wondering what happens after you die. And, it's no longer thoughts grounded in how others would react, or how many people would go to my funeral, because i no longer care about that. I'm just sick of life. It's tiresome, and i would love to sit somebody worse off than me, and ask them ""how do you keep going?"". If it were not socially weird and messed up, i would have asked the wheelchair bound customer as to how he keeps going? What keeps him alive? "

What's the difference? I can't see any. Yet people tell me all the time....""You'll get past this, you'll get over it, things will get better"".....How, exactly? Time doesn't heal everything. That's a crock of crap. Would these people say the same thing to his parents whilst secretly thinking that it was the end of their lives? Why lie?

					Depressed thinking
				","

							Throughout every moment of consciousness, I find myself overwhelmed with depression, loneliness, and the sense that I linger in the middle ground between invisibility and nonexistence.  My waking hours are spent in the constant search of distractions, not simply to avoid the regrets and mistakes that haunt my thoughts but more importantly, to stave off the short-lived day dreams that cruelly tempt me with joy, hope, and unbridled optimism.  In those fleeting seconds, my eyes glaze over and my mind drifts toward places that I’ve never been, back to conversations that never happened, and into an intimate embrace with a perfect moment during which all potentials, all possibilities are fulfilled.  In those fleeting seconds, I cease to be me.  Even with the memories of thousands of days behind me, I fondly dwell only upon these dreams.  To lose myself within them, utterly, completely, and uncontrollably is the only thing to which I look forward as well as the thing I fear the most. As wonderful as they are, the only constant, certainty, and uniformity within their variety is the fact they will always end.  When this occurs, I am left alone and suddenly disconnected again in my empty world, with my face lost in the crowd, my voice drowned in the silence, and my heart beating just fast enough to keep me alive.

We go to work to receive a little baseball card of a slaveowner that we then have to fork over to the electricity company so that we can see what we are doing inside our homes when the sun goes down. This drives me insane! I am not 100% bitter towards the government for the system that's in place, the real target of my hatred and bitterness is mother nature and the tendencies of the universe."

							I dont really know if anyone else will get help from this because i dont know people that will really read things while they are suicidal. I also dont know if the people that will really do it if anything could really stop them. Ive been basically borderline suicidal for over a year. I will even say i will probably cry alot writing this stuff because ive been in denial alot. I used to see all of this as bad and just made me feel like i was going to be like my family. I will say that the main things that made me feel this way was that i was having a huge crisis and so many things in my life have completely fell apart. My ex eventho she said she still loved me and showed it, is in denial as well. I guess her denial is something that she is kinda ok with. So i knew she was going to have sex with someone else. Im not gonna really go into detail but we were supposed to lose our virginity to each other. I will just say because of the circumstances it didnt happen and it seemed like it wasnt going to happen. I know now that she had it with someone else. I also know that she feels like it should have been with me. I also know at the same time that she doesnt want to be with me. This is the mindset of someone who has been abused and it was something i had to deal with for a long time. I also know that there really isnt anything i could do. I will also say that i was abused by her and neglect. So im still stuck in the mindset of an abused person and life doesnt really make much sense.

Well, I wrecked that car today and it's my fault. The insurance people are gonna come out tomorrow and give us an estimate. We are guessing we will only get around 3 or 4 grand for it because of the mileage. My Mom has basically told me she will not cosign for me to get a loan and get a new car. She shuts down every idea I have. I had made plans to get an apartment in the fall with my gf, to go back to school, etc. And she just always goes back and forth and say's I can't do this, I can't do that, etc. "

And when things are moving this fast, I can see very far back in time, to the moment that the first organisms developed in the ocean and soon began to crawl on land - and this is all seen at lightning-fast speed, remember - and then life spreads accross Earth like a fungus or a moss, a giant biologically-diverse lichen that thrives by coastal, fertile regions but can be sustained also in environments of extreme heat, cold, wetness and dryness.  I see all this and I don't feel any different from a tree or a wolf or a goddamned dandelion.  In theory this is a beautiful feeling.  But the expectations upon me are quite different from that of a tree or a wolf or a dandelion.  Not only am I expected to do the big things - graduate college, get a decent job, find a decent house, marry a decent woman and raise decent children - but all the little things that fill up every moment in the interim.  Talking, for example: I'll have to talk almost every day of my life until I die.  I'll have to engage in conversation and talk about how this is doing or how that is doing and what needs to be done about this and what seems wrong about that.  I'll have thousands of questions asked by people I don't want to give answers to; and in all probability, I'll often ask questions to people who would rather not give the answers to me.  Both experiences are enough to warrant the Big Quit.  I have panic attacks on what may be a regular basis, and I don't expect them to stop without medication - but is it wiser to curb the panic attacks, or their source?  Ideally I would live a life where I entertained no thoughts and had extremely limited interaction with the human world.  So I could become Taoist or Buddhist and meditate in the ruins of an ancient hillside monastery.  Or I could wait out what is most certainly a dark phase that comes with being 22 and pretty soon I'll fall in love or something pleasant like that and forget all about the tremendous, crushing beauty of the structure of life on this planet.  We are organisms at the end of the day, and my job is to pass on my specific strain of DNA into the big machine so it may determine what organic strategy is best for the present.  And once I do, my job will be done, and I will bend down on my hands and knees so my genetic likeness can spring forward from my back and fly into the big mess.  I can't kill myself and I can't kill anyone else, so do I let my mind tear itself apart and meanwhile maintain a fragile facade of contentness?  Or maybe I do kill myself, like I've thought about; I've tested attaching my belt to the ceiling; I've held the knife against my wrists and the sharp pressure on my skin; I've pretended to jump off bridges for the amusement of my friends, the joke always rising first from desire; I even wrote a song once, while drunk, about jerking the wheel.  Many of my friends tell me I think too much when I try to talk about the nature of life on Earth because of the conclusions I come to - but to ignore it would feel like surrender.  Maybe if I wait a bit longer all the things that seem terrible will make some kind of poetic-galactic sense.  Either way, the days keep getting worse.

							been thinking of it for a while, and no i need help but its really hard to find. everything just starts going bad. the one person i truly loved, my grandma, is now in her death bed with cancer. Im in the Army and have now been blamed for a whole entire Marijuana conspiracy when i dont even smoke the stuff. so i might get dishonorable discharge. then i can never find a job again. the army was all i had and thought that could change me. but now it hasnt, its only made things worse. there is nothing left for me here. nobody would miss me, so thats what made me really think of it.


"
,"

							I think I have known for years that I would take my own life in the near future. I think about it daily- not in a depressed way but rather in a matter of fact. When I was fourteen I sexually exposed myself to sister that was 2 years younger than me. The prosecutor waited until I was 18 and one week to press charges for attemted child molestation. I accepted a plea under threats of my mom to not drag the family through this and I have been under lifetime probation for five years now. I cannot have contact with anyone under the age of 18 and must sit in a group of guys every week, some of which are serial rapists and I have to listen to detailed accounts of their deviencies. I almost think at times it makes me think devient. Anyway, I got married two years ago and bought a house and started a business with my wife, I am only 23. I figure I have experienced all I need, except raise a family, but I will never be allowed to do that. I attend church weekly so I feel mostly peace with that. I have routine polygraphs to see if I have contact with minors (even proximity) and I am constantly under servailance. I just cant take the pressure, and knowing that all this is because of stupid choices I made when I was 14, almost ten years ago, and the economy hasnt helped finances, making things worse. I just am done stressing and there is no other way to escape life. I can't handle it anymore. I just want to hear that it's justified, to kill myself would be perfectly okay.

					A different approach...
				","

							Hi. My name is Elizabeth. Last year I tried to kill myself the day after Thanksgiving. At that point, I'd been depressed for a very long time and was done with living. I'd been cutting myself and taking large amounts of pills (stuff like ibuprofen and Tylenol, not heavy stuff) to make myself feel better. Anyway, I failed my attempt and was sent to the hospital, where I ended up working out some issues and getting myself set up with a councilor and getting put on meds.  It worked for a time... but deep down I knew I wasn't really well. I recently stopped taking the meds because I don't like the fact that I can only be happy when medicated, it doesn't feel normal or right. Now I'm miserable and I'm losing my will to live. My grades are dropping and I feel like I'm losing my friends, and my family life gets worse all the time. I want to make things better, but it's like my brain is saying ""We need to get moving Elizabeth..."" and the rest of me is saying ""Whats the point?"". Honestly, I don't really think suicide will make it ""better"", but I feel like it'd be best to end it now so it can't get any worse."

							I've been close to suicidal thoughts over the past week, but I started taking Vitamins B Complex (Includes B6, B12 and folic acid), Vitamin C and Magnesum and right now I'm starting to feel a whole lot happier! Hopefully it'll stay this way. I found a few sites that say that deficiencies in these Vits and minerals can cause depression. I really have nothing to die over. Even though I've had a bad year I'm just low and know that it's just my brain reacting to this. Also I found that exercising can tire me out and I had less thoughts running though my mind. I don't care how bleak things look today, my negative thoughts WILL pass. I want all those considering suicide to realise that the way you think is because of the chemical changes in your brain and that nothing is ever as bad as it seems. The more your depressed, the more your brain uses up those vitamins in the body so that worsens the depression."

Why isn't it enough just to love someone? Why does a person make it so hard for another to love that person? Why do they always run away?

My stupid a$$ just didn't take enough pills to make it work, so I ended up in a mental ward for almost a week. I'm supposed to be in therapy, but I don't have the money, and I think therapists are BS anyways. I'm apathetic about everything. Well, almost. Idk, I just can't be happy. Or when I am happy, it's like a ridiculously high amount of happiness, then I get miserably depressed. I know, you're thinking bipolar, already been diagnosed with it.

							Hi guys, i am new to enotalone but have been reading alot of threads. My gf broke up with me about 7 weeks ago and i am seriously struggling with depression. it was a very serious relationship and now that i look back i always did suffer from slight depression and this drained her. she issues also didnt help as seeing her down in the dumps made me feel even worse. i talked to her in person about 2 weeks ago and explained what i was goin thru and how i am so sorry that it affected her like this. ii was unaware of what was happening as it was a long distance relationship and she also had many issues of her own so instead of looking at my self for the problem i just blamed what was easy. i told her that i dont blame her for getting rid of me and that i didnt deserve her. she said there may be a chance for us in the future and that she would like to stay friends. i then called her a few days ago and she was very bitter towards me and even somewhat resentful. it hurts so much knowing that she now resents me. i am scared that she will always resent me. The truth is we both had our part in it ending but i blamed myself entirely and told her this. She is now moving on very well and doing alot of positive things. i am very happy for her. i am stuck in a hole that seems to be getting deeper and deeper. i pretty much just lay in bed all day dwelling on all the things i did to end the relationship.

I want to be able to control myself and I'm so frustrated that people are holding me back. My mom believes she controls every  *  *  *  * ing aspect of my life. If that were the way it was supposed to be, why would I be able to control MYSELF (physically and mentally). I'm just done. IT's as if everywhere I turn, no one is there to help me.

					suicide seems inevitable
				","

							I'm 21 right now and suicidal thoughts have always only been an escape, a fantasy. Circumstances in my life have brought to a point where I think about suicide alot though. Started in my teens and knowing my life was going to get really painful  at around my age suicide has always been a thought of mine. As my life becomes more and more uncomfortable/ stressful and  I cannot forget or use simple things to make my life more bearable, suicide is coming closer. The issues I have and have had for a while are beginning to show themselves more and more with age. Only the prospect of becoming a totally different person has given me hope for the future, but as I age I realize I cannot change these circumstances,they're personal,mental, not things i can change. So as my life is not so stressful to where Ive killed myself already I see in the future where I will not be able to escape  anymore and I will kill myself. The day seems to come closer everytime I slip back into a deep depression/realization of reality and whats really up with me. The truth is that I dont want to be who i really am, but pretending to be someone else won't keep me going. I feel that suicide is inevitable for me, that by not killing myself now is just delaying the future. Coming to terms with my issues would mean becoming someone I cannot live with. I feel that my mind/soul are trapted in the wrong body and  I should do myself a favor and let my body decay and recycle and my mind/soul to just die, or move-on which ever happens to the mind/soul. Sorry bout the grammar, semester just got out, I feel like I owe it to myself to take a break on proof reading and grammar today

					Suicidal Boyfriend
				","

							Last night i decided to talk to my boyfriend about our relationship and how i've been finding a few things that he does kind of unexceptable. I kept the conversation as light as possible as i was scared of his reaction. You see my boyfriend is fairly unstable and has had suicidal tendencies in the past, despite this, i felt that i couldn't hold back how i was feeling any longer. Anyway as i was talking he strarted to tell me that ""i should just forget about him"" and that ""everyone would be better off without him"". I started to panic, as these are the first warning signs that he wants to commit suicide. Usually at this stage i would give up, take back everything i had been saying, but last night i felt that i couldn't give in to his threats and so i carried on with my point. However things got worse and he started to really sacre me by saying that ""he was really going to to it this time"" it was after this that he hung up on me, which made me absolutly terrified, i mean how do you cope if someone kills themself because of something you said? So i immediately called him back and luckly he answered. I begged and pleaded with him not to do anything stupid and told him that i didn't mean what i had been saying. It didn't help though and he told me he was sitting in the bath and all he needed now was for me to put the fone down. Obviously i wasn't going to do that so i made a plan that if he was to hang up on me i would call his house fone and tell his parents. As i was listening to him mumbling about how much better off people will be, i think i started to have a panic attack - my body started to uncontrolably twitch and spasm, i found it extremly difficult to breath and my words wouldn't come out of my mouth. I've never experienced anything like it before. My boyfriend heard what was happening to me and it must have brought him to his sense slightly as he promised to get out of the bath and started to calmed down. "

							After being dumped by my first boyfriend and lover at 26 I've gone in a downward spiral.  Antidepressants aren't helping.  Therapy is not helping.  I can listen to all of the positive, uplifting podcasts in the world but nothing is making me feel better.  I won't say that the break-up cause all of this.  Obviously all of this was inside me before I even met him.  I felt okay (not really happy but okay) about my life before I met him, and I was on cloud 9 when I was with him...I thought life couldn't get any better.  I didn't really see it coming when he dumped me because he gave me the impression he cared about me and missed me.  In any case this lose only solidifies my belief that no man can ever love me and that I'm worthless (it took me until 26 to even get a boyfriend.  You always hear about kids on the playground with boyfriends or girlfriends--I never even had that).  "

How should I tell my mom about this?? I don't know what to say or anything...I need somebody opinion. Maybe someone who's been through this all ready. Please help me.

							I often wonder why I wake up in the morning. Why I live each day. I've thought of suicide ever since I was 13. Countless times I'd hurt myself. Almost got kicked out of school because of it. Parents divorced at 13, my only brother left at 17, rarely do I get to talk to him. I'm no close to my dad, very close to my mom. Women and relationships are a disaster. People call me ""weird"" constantly, even though I have no idea what makes me weird. Music makes me happy, that's it. I've thought about dong drugs or getting super drunk ( even though I can't drink because of my liver) I've always wanted to be a dad and be a good husband, if not that, be in some sort of long term relationship.

I don't think something like this would hurt so much but it does..and I can't help but wonder that if I'd always felt this way I would know how to cope better. I didn't always used to look like this...and now I look at myself and wonder how my appearance changed so much. I feel so much guilt over this but I used to have friends and now I only have one friend and I think the only reason she still remains close to me is because she feels bad for me (I was also gone to a treatment center out of state for 2 years) and so I feel like she thinks shes owes it to me to be kind to me. I just feel so different from everyone and I have scars from cutting and I'm so disproportioned .. and I've become so isolated because I dont wan't people to see me. i stay inside all the time.  And now I feel like I want to kill myself to stop the pain but I don't have courage..

My friend who i went on holiday with didnt support me and got all my other friends to turn against me. I had no one. My Mother never spoke about it to me and I left college when I was seventeen and got a job. I met my boyfriend when I was 15 who i am still with now. My life has been hell for the last five years of my life. me and my boyfriend are getting married next year and we have just bought a house. I have recently found out that my boyfriend has a gambling problem and has been blowing all of our money while we are trying to renovate our house. I can no longer cope! I want to move away and make a fresh start but he wont. I want to move to the ststes or whatever but he doesnt want to so we cant. he never talks to me about this and if we do he usually ends up arguing with me. I have just got a new job as a assistant manager and my new manager hates me for no reason. Everything bad always happens to me. I cannot see a light at the end of this tunnel. I am so unhappy I just want to die. I cannot cope anylonger. The guilt kills me everyday. I hate myself.

Everyone believes I have potential. But I see any job or anything I do in the long term meaningless. Not to say that what I have done is not important to the grand scheme, it's just that I feel that if not me then someone else. Sometimes people annoy me and I feel as if I could simply end their life. End everything that they could ever become. This can even be a person I know well such as a friend. But do I care, no. I don't even think I would feel anything after the deed. Even if I stood at their funeral with their family and friends watching. I have never acted on this impulse because it is selfish. Also I am sure that I would get caught as well. I have had good friends enter and leave my life. I had a best friend that recently disappeared.

I put her as my number one priority for the whole time. We had a great relationship and till the day it ended I never saw this coming. I still love her very much. I dont eat like I used to. My friends...the ones I have left say I'm not the same person anymore. I want them to know its not my fault. I dont think its working. I have nothing going for myself and I cant go a single minute without thinking about her. I hate to say it but she was my life. Now my life is gone. The pain is unbearable. I just want to be happy. Its been a few months and I'm still not. She seems to be extremely happy. I really just dont want to be here anymore. I really hate what I have become. Everyone I talk to about it seems to shift me aside saying it will be ok. Not really listening at all. I think things would just be easier for the people around me if I let this all go and wasnt here anymore. I really can honestly say that I cant live without her...I mean look at what this whole situation has done to me. I dont feel anything anymore. Love, Hate, Happy, Sad. I just wander around aimlessly and everyone sees it.

							I grew up rural VA, broke the country mold and moved to Atlanta GA, then decided I liked summer so I got a job in Grand Cayman and lived in the beautiful Caribbean. I was walking down the road one night with a girl i knew, she put a pipe to my mouth, i thought it was weed, it was crack. My life spiriled out of control. I'm a fujative from Cayman, I snuck on a drug charge and I tried to make a new start in Sarasoata Fl.  Didnt take long for me to find crack  got fired from jobs decided to go back to Atlanta where again quickly found crack. I;ve had 5 hospitlizations for suicidal ideation and or attempts. I was diagnosed major  depressive disorder. I could beat the crack and did 4 months in rehab to turn around and use. Long story short, I'm 7 months sober in Colorado therapist sees me once a week and lota of group. In the pat I was always treated for substance abuse and it didn't work because substance abuse was a side effect of what was really wrong. The crack ruined me but before that alcohol, weed snoerting coke, I self medicated all the time, cross addicted. No I'm clean the now say I'm Bi-Polar1 and Borderline Personality Disorder and Anxiety to to PTSD (Another story) My point is I've been through  * * * * seen street life, had guns pointed at my head and didn't care, found dead bodies and heard people getting killed. Death is not pretty and if nothing else you wanna go natural so you can look pretty. Not a day goes by I don't think about slitting my throat slashing my wrist, and fight the temptation of stepping in front of the truck. Every F***ing day. I take my meds and I do what I'm told. I can't work  because I screwed my mind up so much and my illlnesses were all aggrevated by the subtance abuse as well. I used to make $100.000.00 a year i have nothing, blame it all illness blame it on drugs but no matter what I try to blame my destitution on it all comes back to me making bad choices. My Bi-polar didn't make smoke or crack, thats was my decission. So now I got nothing, but you know what nothing is a place to start. Start making good decission, stay in those groups, talk to someone, get help with decissions it starts there, but you got to do it take that step. I relapased 4 times, but I don't call it that, I wasn't ready to really give up so I call it taking a break ad getting back to it. My addiction will follow me always, but with therapy, my mental health willl improve with help and family I can rebuild and learn to make those descissions that will help me get past the nothing I have then you get past what you got, tiny steps baby steps but it gets there. You know, everyone is a little messed up, its called unique by some, I say the world is nuts but either way we have common goals we can achieve"

					When suicide is like an ""old"" friend
				","

							Does anyone here ever feel like they ""know"" they will one day kill themselves? Maybe things are not bad right now, but you've known most of your life that you'll eventually end your life. You've fantasized and even planned your suicide countless times. When we moved to a new location I sort of took note (to myself) of places in the countryside where I could possibly blow my brains out should the time come."
"
					I know this is probably the wrong place.
				","

							I can't seem to find a purpose or a path. I can't seem to find a way to escape this feeling that I am living a pointless and sad existence. I can honestly say the only thing keeping me from killing myself is the fact that it would leave my parents with a mess to clean up as far as bills and burial go they barely have enough money as it is. I think about it every day, but I love my parents so much I could never do that them....but something inside me hurts so much that living my life this way forever is more torturous than the pain I know I would cause them. I'm not a lonely person, I have my family. I have long distance friends, they have all moved away and started new lives, we rarely talk anymore. But me....I am so afraid to live my life I would rather end it than hope it gets better. I just needed to write it so that one person could know. It's the hardest life to live. I just feel empty inside, that my life is so routine and so hard to get through everyday. I have no interest in the things I used to love no passion for anything. And I question how God could allow someone to hurt so much and not help them. I could ask for help until I am blue in the face but he will still be far away and unmoving. I know what people will think but pills and professional help are the last thing I need, they never helped before, only made me feel sick. But why can't one person tell me why my life is meaningless and pathetic when everyone else is so full? Why do I have to go to movies and dinner alone while others have significant others and best friends to talk to? Why does my life always end up so lonely?

							I've been of late, lost in deep thought since I have found the time and realized... theres nothing really to live for in my life... I just completed high school and I've moved onto a local community college, I just got hired so i have a small job to give me some extra money, and I've yet to find anything worth living for... many times I've thought of suicide, usually when i circle my thoughts around things dealing with life. I would like to have a girlfriend, but i know I'll never have another one, born alone and destined to die alone, so true it is. But other than petty things like being alone i don't understand so much and it leaves me feeling like everything is pointless. I look at things like choice.. it's just so messed up what a cruel illusion it is, there is no choice it's just a form of control, every major decision is so rigged it isn't even funny, it's like a path through the woods where at the splits, the path continues and all other ways drop off into a chasm. Society is another i don't understand, it strives so hard to tell every one, be yourself, do what you want to do, express who you are, but then when you do, it ousts you, turns its back and labels you or shoves you in the dark like your some kind of fungus or mold, it's just a hypocritical paradox... it's these small things like this i think of, that just leave me guessing, and give me the impression that I never, was, am, or will be in control of my own life. Whats the point of ""living"" if I'm only playing to the beat of someone else's drum and never my own? I dunno much any more, nothing really makes sense to why it's done or why it's that way... i think i broke my reality of subtle spoon fed innocence and ignorance.  I'd just really like get shot right in the head.... and make things so much more uncomplicated...

							I wrote this is my other thread in the Relationship section but I really need fast advice on this because I really want to go and see him but he's asked me not to. He's in the hospital. His flatmate found him lying on the bathroom floor at 2am last night and when he couldn't wake him up he phoned for an ambulance. My boyfriend drank himself unconscious and the blood test showed he took an overdose of painkillers too. His friend says that my boyfriend made him promise not to call me until this morning and that he doesn't want me to go to the hospital to see him since he's being let out later today after more blood tests. He is refusing to answer any questions about it and even refusing to acknowledge what he did. I know he said I shouldn't go to the hospital but I want to see him. I can't believe this has happened. I am so upset right now. Should I go to the hospital anyway? I'm just sitting here worrying and crying.

							my life sucks...im completely alone. i have no friends...i dont even have family to talk to. i live with my parents and grandparents and aunts and uncles. we have 3 houses in a row, tons of family but no one for me to talk to. the only person that noticed i was depressed was my grandma from my mother's side. she asked me today why i was looking depressed and walking around all day the last few days. everyone else was just doing there own thing. my grandma only knows how to speak chinese tho, and i dont know how so i cant talk to her. my depression is getting worse and starting to turn to anger again, i feel its the only way for me to let it out. i tried talking to my dad, he always gives the worse advice and doesnt understand anything, and so does my mom. my dad tried talking to me just now...i got back from class today, i try talking to people and it never works out...i never have anything interesting to say, i dont know how people do it...i havent had a friend in 4-5 years. i talked to my dad about not being able to hold a friendship with anyone(pretty pathetic) and he just goes on talking about how when he does real estate he used to go around peoples houses and asking them if they want to sell there house and that you just have to learn to face rejection and move on. when you go around knocking peoples doors asking them that obviously your going to get  <> rejected almost all the time, and those are potential customers you'll see for business only for a short while and then never see them again. that had nothing to do with making and keeping friends. why the  <> do i keep talking to that retard. i just got frustrated talking to him again and hit something, then he threatened to kick me out of the house and told my grandma(my dads side one) that im just mad cuz i dont have any friends, and she comes in and tells me that its wrong to get mad and hit stuff...theres just no way for me to let anything out of me...theres just no reason for me to keep living...i dont know why im still alive when theres nothing for me to look forward to...

It scared me.Because it was so peaceful and felt like i was just drifting off to sleep.But I thought of  my 18 month old son and how my suicide wouldnt stop my pain, it would just transfer to him and he would have problems with his dad killing himself and wondering if it was his fault etc.i cant do that to him. i've been in therapy for a year. i tried to jump off a building once and my friends had to restrain me. my therapist tried to have me check myself into a psychiatric hospital but i didnt want to go so i told her what she wanted to hear, that i was fine, even though it wasnt true. i've been on lexapro for a year. i was up to 40 mg and i felt it wasnt working. so i stopped taking it in june. since then i have crashed and i feel like my whole world is collapsing around me. i dont have the desire to get out of bed and do anything. and if i do i get really hyper for a while and i'm fun then i get anxiety ridden and have panic attacks etc."

					Hoping for Irredeemable Failure
				","

							Has anyone else ever felt that they've consiously or unconsciously hoped for some sort of irredeemable failure?  Afterall, if success becomes obviously and objectively impossible, can you imagine the feeling of complete liberation from obligations, from routine, from effort, and from struggling.  How tempting is giving up in the worst of times?  What causes you to fight on is the realization that the battle can be won or what a waste of time it was fighting all those battles before only to give up now, when you're closer to your goals or dreams.  A massive all-encompassing failure would cut the strings that drag you along.  In this case, giving up would actually be rational.  If you have no one, if everything you own was stolen, and your reputation so tarnished that no one would ever think fondly of you - regardless of whether you died an old man in your bed or five minutes from now.  If you define happiness in such a way that you can never have it, then what then?

					I'm Going to Do It Soon
				","

							There is no reason for me to live anymore. I am 150 lbs overweight and can't stop eating because thats the only pleasure I can get. I'm crippled by shyness, I haven't left the house in a month now. I have insomnia, thats why I am up right now just thinking of my misery. I have no friends at all in this entire world, not one. I had one but she has severe mental problems herself and a few days ago she suddenly turned on me and says she hates me and hopes I die. All I can think of is her cruel words, she says she's going to kill me or get someone else to do it and I hope she does. She keeps harassing me online and I can't get rid of her, I've tried. She knows where I live and my phone number so she will just keep on like that forever, I know. I will never have another friend because I can't ever trust anyone. Besides that, I am almost 20 and still live at home, I am so shy and scared I can't get a job, I am too scared to even answer the phone much less work somewhere. I can't drive anyway for the same reason. Getting any employment will be hard otherwise because I have learning disabilities and ADD. I've never been in a relationship and I know if I go on I will die alone, I have no idea how to make friends or talk to people. I don't understand what people are feeling or thinking and I say things that are wrong and don't know why unless someone explains it to me. My family isn't supportive, my mom works so much she is never there to talk to, she is the only family I really have, I haven't seen my dad since I was a kid. I have a brother who is always mean to me, that is normal with siblings I guess but he is 17 and old enough to know I can't take him calling me fat and ugly all the time. My mom is at work now, I am all alone until 9 am and I can't sleep, I cut myself some today but nowhere that anyone can see. I want to do it some more but I want to stop also, I have been crying all day and my head hurts, I am exhausted and I can't sleep. I'm on Lexapro and Klonopin but they don't help me very much, I have been on many medicines and nothing ever helped, I was in counseling for years but that didn't help either so I stopped going. I don't know what to do, I don't know where to go for help, I have also been in hospitals and clinics but all they do is change my medicine and I am so stressed and panic there because I can not be away from home for more than a few hours. I cannot go in a store even by myself and I have to walk close to someone always, anywhere I go. I look bad and I can't afford new clothes, I don't know anything about hair or makeup to look better. Anyway I have a skin problem that causes brown discoloration all over my body so I am ugly no matter what and I have bad scars from surgery I had a few years ago. My life is just so bad and I can't find any reason to live now. There is no hope, I don't know what to do. I've been researching ways to kill myself and have a note ready, I think I will do it soon. Something inside wants to be talked out of it but I really don't know if I can. I just don't have any future wheter I live or not.

					Life as a Game of Monopoly
				","

							When was the last time you played a game of Monopoly, actually setting up the board, organizing the properties, and handing out the money?  The games often lasted hours until someone or everyone finally stood up with frustration and quit.  So often, it gets to the point where two people control the whole board and each ends up paying out and taking in the exact same stack of money, over and over again.  While you’re playing you think about how much more fun this game used to be when you were younger and it was new.  As soon as you’ve gone around the same board so many times, routinely fought for the same valuable spaces, and paid the fines or received the financials windfalls again and again, the game just loses all its attraction and meaning.  When your pride or ambition keeps you playing for hours with the knowledge that you’ll probably never win, sometimes you just hope that you’ll land on all your adversary’s worst spaces.  If this happens, you didn’t lose due to lack of skill or perseverance but rather simply because of random chance - and it's not your fault.  While you’re there at that table, you must move around in an endless and repetitive circle.  You hope for that quick end so that you can move on with you life or back to a place where hard work, intelligence, and the best intentions can change your life and those of the people around you for the better.

The few people that are nice enough to say hi to me when I see them I just freeze up around them and don't know what to say. It's so hard to see everyone else around you so happy and carefree and I wish I could just be like them but I can't because in the back of my mind I know I will never get those years back. I'll never be given the opportunity to be friendlier, to be more outgoing. It's gone forever. I've spent my entire life alone in my room. I wish I had someone to talk to. I wish I wasn't an only child and I hate living so  <> far away from everyone I know because then I could go and do all those things that I should have been doing all this time. I don't have a car, and there's no way to get one because my parents would never let me buy one. i can't talk to my parents. all my dad does all day is come home and tune out watching that  <> tv all night fighting with my mom about money. all my mom ever does is yell at me or my dad. she's the only one i've ever talked to about anything but if i told her how depressed i always am should would just get mad and think that i was an ungrateful son after all of the sacrifices they've made for me. i hate all of this, life is so empty. i can't just sit around the house anymore i need to talk to other people but i can never go anywhere and there'd might as well be no one here with my parents the way they are. it's sad that this is the only place i can say these things but i just can't hold it in anymore. i've thought about killing myself so many times but i'm too afraid to do it. i'm thinking maybe tomorrow when i drop my mom off at work i'm just going to skip work and take her car all the way back home and just sit there with the garage closed. i think that's the only peaceful, painless way to go because it's like going to sleep. if this is what things are going to be like until i go to college i can't wait another year. besides, things won't ever change it's too late for me i'll never be normal . you don't know what it's like to sit alone day in day out, the only people you ever see are your parents. you can't go anywhere because you don't have a car, and whenever you ask to borrow one of your parents cars they wont let you because hey wont pay for the gas and you have no money because your parents wont let you spend any and everyone you know lives an hour away. no one ever calls...............and when i call they're never there. the loneliness just never goes away....

I am so lonely and isolated, and I don't know how to break out of that.  I have no friends, and I have no idea how to make them.  I keep repeating the same patters in my love life, and the more it happens, the stupidier I feel because I should have known better.  Im just lost.

I can't help feeling like I've pushed everyone away and that I've  <> up my life. I can barely even function. My sleep patterns are so thrown off, I can't eat, I can't enjoy anything without feeling guilty or depressed, I don't know what to do. "

					Question about suicidal thoughts and break ups...
				","

							I am just curious as to what you think it says about someone who has suicidal thoughts after breaking up. The reason as I am curious is that my first serious ltr ended a yr ago and we both havent moved on yet but she is dating someone else and has been. for some reason she always comes back into contact with me. then we are fine for a while and then she is distant and I end up depressed again. I know it is my own problem that I allow this but I recently decided I will never speak to her again, as she cheated on me and now has cheated on this new guy so how could I trust her. but anyways lately I have been thinking about suicide. I would never actually kill myself but these thoughts creep into my mind as I am alone a lot. I just wonder is it because I am emotionally weak or just been on an emotional rollercoaster for far too long? I feel bad that I let her do this to me and did not stand up for myself and I know I should have.

							Feeling REALLY down.  I am so depressed.  Suicide has never creeped into my head until recently.  I find myself saying things like, ""If things don't change by so-and-so date, I'm done.""  I picture the world without me.  Like what impact would it have.  And to be honest, I don't see it as a big deal.  Of course it would hurt my parents and family but they would get over it.  They have their lives and life would go on.  I just feel so insignificant.  I really have nothing to live for.  No girlfriend, no friends, nothing.  I feel my efforts at making life better for myself is a complete waste of time.  Why keep going to school?  So I have a high GPA...so what?  Nobody cares.  Why keep going to work?  So I have my own apartment in an expensive neighborhood and are able to buy expensive stuff.  So what?  Nobody cares.  Why keep going to the gym?  I lost weight and achieved a 6 pack.  So what?  Girls don't care.  Why even get out of bed?  NOBODY CARES!!  Things just aren't changing and I don't see light at the end of the tunnel.  I feel so alone.  I hate it.  I don't want to keep living like this."

I was truly waiting to die for days on end and wondering why I hadn't.  I was in a pretty serious car accident and survived. My life has gone downhill since that point and I still wonder why I survived.  I then reached the peak of suicide, several times, and haven't done it.  "

I cry - alot.  The only escape I have is sleep.  I wish I could sleep forever.

We both have Asperger's syndome and I'm afraid she might have psychosis like what I have. She has been talking to herself, and just today she said she say images from the future and she wanted to kill herself from what she saw. She is so close to me, I can't stand to see her go through what I have gone through before I was put on medication. She is scared to go on medication. Oh, and she used to love cute things, but now she has become scared of them. It is so hard for me to help her. I know what she is going through, but that alone is not enough. This time I was only just bearly able to help her, I'm not sure if I can next time. I'm so scared of losing her. After all the years we have known each other I still call her Jirachu and I still don't know her real name. She was recently grounded from getting online late at night so now we bearly ever get to talk. I want to be there for her if she ever needs me again. I usualy am so good at helping people. This is so hard for me and now I don't know what to do. I met Jirachu even before I met my first GF, she is my best and closest friend. I can't let her go.

							It’s so hard to focus, with these thoughts running through my head.  Sometimes I feel as though I'm worthless, and non existent, I have no right to feel this way.  People say I’m important to there lives, important for them to stay right.  A suffering for myself is to stay living, but I must not go because of fear for those around me. I must feel for their safety.  Risking the death of myself, would hurt those close to me. But they will be over it in moments of time.  Because I’m just a lost soul who cant finds it way. With a corrupted mind fallowing all the time.  The pleasure of life has now been infected with the pain. I cant be still or alone without it coming out to haunt me.  I just had wished to rest and sleep this pain away.  I just want one thing now, after all this is through, and I am out of sight. I want my soul to be forgotten, and the tears wiped away. I want to be of no existent. "

Before we hooked up into a relationship i was in the process of moving to a new city about 30 miles from where i used to live.  We hooked up about 2 months before i moved.  After we had been together for a few months after i moved she wasnt too happy with the situation so i said i would move back once i could find the right house to buy. Last week she told me it was over, i was devastated because as far as i knew everything was going fine.  I really didnt get a proper explanation as to why.  Due to being with her a lot i didnt get to grips with living in new city and spent a lot of my time back in old town."

							Well I was backstabbed by some friends at work. I never knew that people I thought I could talk to and be friendly and sometimes talk my life to would stab me in the back and cost me my job. I was placed on suspension with pay from work but I feel this shouldn't have happened to me. People at work made false allegations agaisnt me that I was not helping them out and that I was listening to music and not doing my job.  I was on a lunch break! i can do what I want, but yet they went to Human Resources and file complaints about me. I feel extremely hurt about the backstabbing supposed friends did to me that it makes me see the whole world as one big joke. I feel like whats the point in trying to make new friends or seek new things when there is so much hate, jealousy, backstabbing going on, its really impossible to trust someone in today's world. I feel that if I commit suicide I dont have to deal with this anymore and not have to endure being stabbed like Julius Ceasar or crucified by Jesus by people who are supposed friends. What kind of life can I live after this traumatic experience? I'll always live in fear about trusting people and will end up isolated from the world, this trauma has made me scared of the world and of starting all over in a new job. Why continue living? our life is about MONEY..and thats why we go to school for better job, we try to have this money to have someone to love us by taking them out for movies, etc."

I want it so badly, and yet I just cannot seem to find it.  Instead, I seem to have heartbreak after heartbreak, and I don't know why.  I am not a bad person: I'm pretty, funny, fun to be around, I have lots of friends, and lots going for me.  I'm not saying this to brag, I'm merely trying to point out that I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong.  What makes matters worse is that there are plenty of guys who want to go out with me, I do get asked out quite a bit, in fact I tend to get guys who obsess with me and call me all the time, email me all the time, etc, even after I politely tell them I am not interested.  It just hurts me because I get ""why on earth are you still single"" from guys all the time, it's just from the ones I'm not interested in.  "

							My girlfriend broke up with me. She gave me the whole BS thing that it's her and not me, and I told her that it's okay. When I got off I started crying and didn't know what to do. I looked around for my gun that I have and I eventually found out. I grabbed it and sat on my couch for about 10 minutes just thinking about shooting myself. How easier it would be to get rid of this failure of a life. I have no friends. My girlfriend was the only stable friendship I had in my life. I mean, I talk to some people, but I don't consider them friends. My family isn't even close. They told me that this girl is nothing but damaged goods anyways. I hate them."

							I have posted on this topic before and I am back again in the same situation. I have found myself tonight not wanting to live anymore. Me and my ex broke up a little over a month ago now and I am still not dealing with it well at all. I have had good days and bad but tonight is one of the worst. I have been talking with my ex over the phone and saw her a few times since we broke up. I know a lot of people suggest the whole NC thing but we were doing ok with just talking once in a while. I have been on a few dates since we broke up but I won't lie the whole time I have had hopes me and her would end up back together. Anyway tonight I found out she is dating a new guy. When she told me it completely broke my heart. It made me realize that she really does not have any feeling left in her to get back together with me. I still want her back so bad and thinking now that it is not going to happen makes me not want to live any longer. I don't know what to do. I want her back so bad and she doesn't want it at all. I do have family and friends who would be so crushed over me killing myself but I just don't see a reason to live. It is hard to do it when the one thing I lived for is no longer a part of my life. I give up on even writing this post. Screw it...

I don't know if I am emotionally strong enough to do this. She is all I think about and I know she isn't thinking about me which kills me. I want to just not talk to her anymore but she was my best friend and the person I would usually talk to when having a big problem.

							Cliche question, but one nagging at my mind all the time.  What IS the use, anyways?  Me being up there at the top of the ""most useless, pathetic, slacker human"" list for a long time, is wondering his worth in life.  Money dominates everything, there's no room for shy people, social darwinism has run rampant throughout this country (not to mention world), and thus it doesn't take a mathematician or even scientist to know that I would probably be the human sacrifice if ever needed.  I think I've finally reached the point of being envious of people who piss and moan about their jobs all day long... because at least they're getting paid.  Not even Target will hire me.  I would work at a gas station or at a convenience store, but I'm afraid of being killed, hurt, robbed, or all of the above on the job.  I'd also be willing to work construction, but my mom is still trying to cradle me in her arms telling me it would be ""hard labour on her poor little boy"".  Oh well, since I'm worthless, why not?  She has no idea what she is talking about, yet she is the one that constantly nags that I haven't been ""trying hard enough"" I've only freakin turned in 11 applications and attempted probably twice as many (but stopped after realizing that all the jobs I can apply for require experience)!!!  Ok, so there are people worse off than me.... big help.  Would you tell a blind man standing next to a paraplegic that they ""could be worse off?""  I get that crap all the time and I hate it.  The dating world is exactly the same way as the job market, so I've given up on it 100 percent.  There is no room for me in the world of music.  Every time I try to form a band and create something meaningful (art) that can be observed from many different levels and angles, something screws up.  I get some annoying tagalong like my friend who has a really egregious ego, is a pathological liar, small-talker, and pretty much crapped on the nearly 5 years of effort I've put into bending guitar strings.  He's riding our coattails and thinks we're nothing without him (he told me ""i'm going to make us famous!"").  Of course, he has a big mouth (which needs to be sewn shut) and his bass playing is stiff, grooveless, lifeless, and mediocre at best.  He's wormed his way into the band I was starting (with little to no permission) and takes over.  Oh well, life hardly goes the way I want it.  Other times, it just flat out sucks.  I'm seriously trying to find a quick, painless, guranteed way to the next afterlife.

Today I failed my drivers exam for my full graduated licence, and I scuffed my tires on my SUV during the exam while .  My parents marriage is like falling apart. I'm like failing (barley passing is the truth) almost very course uncept my tech courses.  I've failed the past 2 test in physics, the same with math including one quiz.  Had some problemswith my girlfriend which we fixed so thats fine.  My parents are having some financial problems.  I just lost my job at Best Buy, which I loved cause I was doing IPG (computers and computer perihables).  Besides automotive I love computers.  So the thought of suicide keeps poppin into my head. Ok I would joke around with my friends and with my girlfriend but we were all joking around you know having a good time.  But now my life is  going down the drain.  My friends and my girlfriend have tried to cheer me up but they weren't able to. Not even music was able to  cheer me up which usually does when nothing else can.  So could someone plz give me some advice.

							Recently it's starting to seem like everything I do is just bringing me back to the way I was in middle/high school.  I was constantly emotionally beaten up during those years.  I felt like a ghost and depressed.  No one ever noticed I felt like this, not even my parents, mostly because I never told anyone.  College helped a lot, but recently I've felt like I'm going back to how I felt in middle/high school.  I'm just getting so  * * * *ing pissed off about this.  I've mostly stopped doing most of my school work.  Not because Im sick of it, I enjoy it, but because I just don't care if I fail out of college or not.  I'm thinking of transfering.  I've tried talking to the very few friends I have (I figured they would listen since they dump there problems on me) but it always just seems like when I'm trying to tell somone my problems they aren't really listening and just waiting for their turn to talk.  I can't find any inspiration for my art work for classes and I just want to do my own things.  All and all I thought I was finally getting out of this equivocal depressed feeling, but am feeling more and more like its just pulling me back in.  I don't know.  It's like I've been going back and forth between days of extreme happiness and then days of utter despair.  If you respond to this please don't give me the redundant answers that I have heard time and time agian.  I know it can get better, I know other people are worse off, and I know im not alone in feeling like this.

					How can i help my baby sis!!

							Hello everyone, I am writing because I am very scared right now for the life and future of my baby sister. I have posted for years on this forum crying about myself but for once i am crying for something completely unexpected. I am so torn and scared and anxious right now. My little sis began college this past fall at a very prestigious university. she began feeling the stress all kids do in college. she came home for break and said she was feeling really depressed. the counsleors decided to have her take the year off. she is now home and on anti depressants prozac! OKKKK let me say this is all crazy!!! this never ran in my family and no one has ever been depressed! this is my baby sister! this is all too much! i know that suicide is linked to depression. i have had little training on suicide prevention but i know its good to ask them if they have thought of suicide, how, when, where etc? no one really asked her so I did!!! i didnt want to regret not asking her. so i asked her and sure enough she has had suicidal ideas!! this was very hard for me to take in being her sister. i quickly called my mom and had my sis taken to ER. My sister resented me but i thought i was doing it for the best! all this is happening and i am so freaked out. i am afraid my sister is alone now that she is back from college and home alone while my parents are at work. i dont know what to do. i am a full time student and work as well away from home. i dont know what to do or how to help. i love her so much and if anything happened i would be devasted."

							I have a friend that lives in a different state.  I got a call last weekend from someone telling me that my friend had tried to slit her wrists the night before and she was in the hospital.  My friend has always had issues and always looked for approval in other people, and I think being away from her family and friends (she moved to another state for a guy that she met, whom she found out about a month later was actually married ) brought her to an ultimate low.  She drinks way too much and gets depressed and her friends out there are not really what you call friends.  She's moving back home now, which is good.  But how can I support her?  I mean, I want to be there for her, but I want her to learn how to be happy with herself without relying on other people for approval.  I want her to learn to love herself. And, in the past when we visit each other, or when she was still living in town with me, all we did was party.  With the way she is right now I""m not going to be going out to bars and drinking with her, I think she needs to stop drinking all together.  What are things I can do and say to help her, and how should I go about helping her help herself?

					2nd thoughts on surviving a fire!

							I was sleeping in the basement and woke up to my mom screaming there is a FIRE- I thought o good Ill just stay down here and die. But after 30 seconds of deciding wether this was my out. I got up and opened the door and this big plum of smoke overcame me and I crawled out to the front door. As I sat there with my mom- (who was hysterical at this point) I debated wether I made the right decision. The fire was a grease fire, she put on some new bacon called Blazzin bacon (seriously -thats its name) and she went outside and forgot about it. Anyhow after 10 minutes waiting for the FDept. They put it out - the damage was mainly to the kitchen but everything had to be taken out of the house because of smoke damage- We have been living in a Holiday inn for the past 3 weeks. This hotel happens to be the MEPS headquarters= Military inlistment prossessing station- anyhow there are new 18-25 men/women enlistments that come every night, and sometimes their faimlys are there to say there goodbyes. While I do respect there future service to this country I, think yeah when you get out of basic, your  * * * is heading to iraq and youll probly die- Which sounds like a good idea for me, but I already have a bad back and knee with no cartlidge so I cant enlist- but the recruieter still trys to get me to join up. Well durin the first week there, I went got 2 beers and went to sit in the hottub, and decided Im going to stay in here till I pass out and drown. There wasnt anyone down there, and after about 35-40 minutes I was half unconsious and still sitting up, this lady came over and yelled at me to get up and jump in the pool, which I did. I was beat red and probly had a minor heat stroke-who knows. "

							I'm not to the level of suicide as of yet. I just feel so damn sad and confused. I had a pretty rough pregnancy only because my fiancee called me names and really wasn't there for me. I just felt alone the whole 9 months. He would yell at me or get on to me about something and at that point i was sensitive (naturally) and i would cry and he would call me ""cry baby""among others. I even told him several times to not call me that and it would continue. "

							I never thought I would, but I did 4 years ago. David was and is the best thing to have happened to me. Lately, I have just felt overwhelmed and depressed myself. I usually keep the depressed overwhelmed feelings to myself. I just feel that if I don't say something is wrong, nothing is wrong. The past 2 months I have given myself a rough time. I don't know what is wrong with me, but lately I feel like I am overwhelmed, depressed, and feel that I cannot make him happy anymore. "

					soo soo unhappy
				","

							Well I wouldn't really say I am suicidal. I am however, unbearably, unhappy with my life, and my self. I've never felt so unworthy in my life, and it hurts so much. I would never have the guts to kill my self, but I wish every single day I died in my car accident. I don't wanna feel like this, and I hate talking to people because I hate being judged, or told what's right for me, if I don't know, how should anybody else? I am tired of constantly crying my self to sleep, and not wanting to get out of bed every day. And I don't know how to deal with it.

					Whats the point?
				","

							I am 27 and for the last 10years plus I've wanted to kill myself. This was simply because I feel there is no point to life. I think it started when I was about 14. That was when I took my first overdose ‘just to see what would happen’. Nothing did, was sick for a few days but was fine after a while and never told anyone about it. Finally about 5 years ago I was so depressed with the pointlessness of everything – and don’t get me wrong, I had a boyfriend, family, friends, was in uni, everything was ‘great’ – but was ill so much and I knew it was because of the depression, then I took an overdose that did leave me in hospital for some days. I couldn’t even do that right; I was told I didn’t take enough to even require stomach pumping! Anyway when I came out of hospital, my mum talked to me about it and she cried. That’s the only thing that stuck – ‘I made my mum cry!’ and that was – and still is -  the only reason why I didn’t try to get it right."

					need help desperately the inevitable has to implemented sooner rather than later
				","

							It is imperative that i carry out this suicide attempt sooner rather than later as the longer i wait, the harder it is for me to carry it out due to reasons that i cannot disclose. I have attained a university degree when the odds were obviously stacked against me. I had to endure a self help life in university. I had to depend on myself and my own resources when i had trouble in my studies, all thanks to morons who base their decisions on stereotypes. University is supposed to be filled with joy but mine is infested with students and staff that treated me with complete apathy. This obviously exacarbated the existing problems that i already had before even entering uni such as severe depression and anxiety. Worst of all, my parents showed no indication of joy and i even get told off for finishing a degree that i could have easily screwed up under the circumstances. Furthermore, i dont have a realistic chance of getting a job becuase it will be very apparent to employers how screwed up i am. I rather kill myself than condemn myself to a life on the streets and it is going happen eventually and i want to kill myself before that happens

							I've been feeling so down and so lonely lately and sometimes i cry because of what i think...i start to think that my best friend cares more about her boyfriend than me and i think that she would choose him over me any day ...i know it's really stupid but i can't help myself...she calls him more than me, she hangs out with him more than me and i just simply don't feel loved   i had told her before that i was depressed and she said that she'd always be there for me but i don't feel like she meant it   nobody understands me or cares about me...it's also my family, they make me feel like  * * * * and my mom tells the whole world about my personal issues...i'm usually happy when i'm with people but as soon as i'm alone (even if its only for a day) the feeling comes back and it just won't leave me alone...i wish i had someone to share my thoughts with..like a boyfriend or sumthing...but a good one is hard to find...it's a heavy feeling of emptiness and i don't know what to do about any of my problems   ...i've thought of suicide even tho i'm against it and it just doesn't seem like the answer but someone told me that it may be the only way to get rid of the pain...are there any other ways to stop this feeling?? i really need help and i really need to talk to somebody but i feel like i have nobody to turn to ...if i turned to my friend she'd think i'm always unhappy whenever she dusn't give me attention...and that isn't true...what can i do??

							I just quit college, again, it's so  <edited by moderator> painful when everyone thinks you're a freak... i'm not good looking and i'm not sociable either so chances are i'll never get a girlfriend nor sex, i have no friends and i can't make new ones, my mother hates me for quiting college and that sucks because i have nobody else (my father got lost after the divorce) Now i really don't know what to do, i don't want to get a job since i hate going out and getting laughed at by people... I used to have ""friends""  in highschool, but they all suddenly left me, they were a bunch of ignorant bullies. Since then i haven't had any friends... now i'm 19, COMPLETELY ALONE in life, ridiculed everywhere i go, my mother thinks i'm a failure, i can't get sex, no social life at all... so i think it's time to leave this  <edited by moderator>world, because... i always thought things would get better but 7 years later i've lost all hopes..."

							Most people would think I am successful. I am 60, but married to a woman half my age. I am intelligent, and certainly not in financial trouble. I have a daughter of 18 months with my wife (I love my daughter immensely). I'm in good health. But I feel menaced by death. I've never been depressive, although I had a violent and disturbed father. Strangely enough I feel worse following his death about two years ago than I ever used to feel. I always felt tough, on top of things. I din't let failure upset me. but suddenly it all looks blank, and this feeling has been growing and growing on me for about ten years. What's happening and what do I do? Therapy might be difficult - I'm a member of Mensa, and usually more intelligent than the people I meet (though not necessarily more successful). I'm a privileged and lucky person in many ways, but I've lost my will to live. Does any of this sound familiar to anyone? Please help if you can. Sorry I can't be more coherent, but I just don't understand why the hell I feel this way.

							Today has been the worst day of my life! My boyfriend and i split up. It just wasnt working. I mean i think i'll always love him! But i just wasn't in love. Well it was all fine until i found out he was gonna dump me anyway. (that was fine his reason wasnt) He didnt want to be with me cuz he couldnt stand the  * * * * that i give. By that he means me cutting myself. I thought when you loved someone you stuck by them, you arent ment to hurt them. So now im all alone and to make it worse i didnt just loose a boyfriend i lost a best friend. Oh well two best friends actually. Now one of the people who i was so close to, she welcomed me into her house, her parents were mine, she hates me because i went out with him she hates me because she thought i was shoving into her face the hole time i was with him (she really liked him) But i wasnt, i never did i was even gonna dump him because i didnt want to hurt her! I love her so much she is like my sister but she hates me. Now i have nothing... Whats the piont of going on???? Life is meaningless all it does is hurt and haunt you! My life has been ruined in one simple day....

							My cousin's son was at my parents today, they were baby sitting. He was crying until I walked in, he stopped, looked up at me and gave me this huge smile. It honestly melted my heart, he reached up for me and I held him the whole time. If I tried to set him down he would start crying and put his hands back up, signaling me to pick him back up. When my folks tried to hold him, he buried his head into my chest. It was an absolutely amazing feeling. I was real close to being a father a little bit ago, but my ex had a miscarriage.  I know deep down everything happens for a reason, but I ask myself everyday why I lost my chance to be a father.  Also, it amazes me how children in their innocence can make your misery go away and at the same time make it worse.  Just feeling a little down."

Go into junior year i have 4 suicide attempts. I take pills once and she calls my mom and they take my tyo the hospital and pump my stomache in the nick of time. I am enraged because she stayed on the phoen with me pretending she didnt call my mom. I hated her for that. But she saved my life. Im taken to a mental hospital with kids who just scare the  * * * * out of me. One tried to hang herself with a shower curtain one throws up on the nurses. I lie my way out of there in 2 days. My gf my mom and step dad visit me. He starts to notice my mom cares more about me then him and their marriage goes downhill from there. My mom starts smoking.. But they visit i see my gf my love! and just cry in her arms.. My protector. I get out and shes my life. she is teh reason im alive if she hadnt called i wouldnt be typing this..But i move on i treat her descent. A voice in my head says im gonna kill her by taking her home senior year.. So i refuse to give her rides home. She gets hit by a bus..i rush to the hospital she s ok just banged up.. Life goes on but every day i wake up asking why im here. And why i have so many people who love me and i just cant be happy.. So i cut my wrist..Doesnt cut deep enough back to the hospital but htis time i just come back home. I pull away from my gf cant make her go through this and after 4 months or so i feel just fine... We graduate we are so happy Grad night is so much fun we fall asleep and almost miss the ride home.. She stays at my house for the first time.. My mom is mad i didnt tell her but gets over it..Summer goes by perfectly...until i just dont want to see her..I want a break i tell her she crys but says ok.. I go out with another girl but dont like her..But still see my gf shes been partying goign out with friends but no guys and just doing everything..I never forget this...We make love one night and i ask for her back she says ok...I bring up her party attitude every 3 days she gets sick of it. But we do fine College starts i give her rides every day but she doesnt do  * * * * for me that goes out of her way. I have a job she doesnt.  I fall back into my pit her birthday comes i please her with everything but im 100% not happy now and she notices. I put up with every one i wake up every day wanting to be dead but just push on thinkning this is teh last day i feel like this.

							Hi all, and thanks for reading this.  i have a few basic questions about suicidal thoughts that i would like to have answered."
"
					Do you feel suicidal or depressed? READ THIS!!!!!
				","

							*****READ THIS READ THIS READ THIS READ THIS READ THIS*****"
"
					just wanted 2 let you all know iam dying tonight
				","

							hey if you want to post i might still be here, if i dont then you know iam gone"
"
					I have been having some suicidal thoughts lately ...
				","

							Some of you may remember me, some of you may not ... I use to post here often and encourage people."
"
					Suicidal? Try this.
				","

							I hope this helps. I am trying to share my view on suicide with as many people as I can on this board."
"
					suicidal or not?
				","

							i'm just curious. this chick that i know asked me like 4 years ago if i was suicidal since i always isolate myself. i do isolate myself a lot, but does this really mean i'm suicidal? could she be right? 


"
"
					I've failed again
				","

							I have helped many in my life from killing themselves, however, I've failed twice. The first time, the peron hung himself, this time (happened on Sunday), the girl, with her best friend went into the path of an oncoming train after hugging eachother. I feel as though I've failed them. I know there was nothing I oculd have done to save them, didn't even know there was a problem of that nature. Sadly, I know there was nothing I could have done and that thought just makes me feel worse. I feel depressed and nothign is helping, it's becoming a problem with my friendships too... Thank you in advance.

					I dont get it...

							We were driving home this afternoon and we drove over this bridge here in melb called the westgate bridge that is over 850 metres high. every week there is at least ONE suicide, where one person pulls over and leaps off.  The media is forbidden from publicising this of course as they dont want to give out any more inspiration to those feeling fragile."

							when i was younger i always imaged myself, when i had finished highschool, to be going out with a great boyfriend, having a part time job, heaps of friends and had done well in my exams. well guess what, i finished my VCE/HSC this year, less then a month ago, and i dont have a boyfriend, i dont have a part time job and my friend circle is small and limited. this really cracked down on me today, where i started thinking that i have already failed my life. and if no one is going to employee me now, what makes them want to employ me later on in life. it was only today that because of no job, no boyfriend, that i felt unless, and unwanted. all my friends have part time jobs. admittely not all of my friends have boyfriends, and no matter how many resumes' i hand out, even to shops advertising that they want employees, no one wants me!

							hi, i had an internal monologue in my head the other day, telling me the world was going to end in 10 days, which is tomorrow (tomoz being the 2nd) it told me people were going to descend from the sky and turn the world upside down and walk away. That is a random thing, but the main reason inm posting is because i cant interact with nyone without being annoying or hurting them. I did a very stupid thing last night when i was drunk. I regret it so much, and it also hurt one of my best friends feelings who likes this guy."
"
					this really helped me
				","

							some of you may not be catholic, but, this prayer has helped me and i do believe it works. it is a novena for an impossible request. many of you may feel life is not worth living, but, there is always a little bit of hope no matter how incredibly small it may be (and i am talking small). please don't give up even if it gets unberable. here is a link to the website that has the prayer on it.

							I originally planned to wait until at least my 27th birthday, but I'm not so sure anymore. I'm really not content with the way things are going, and feel too much frustration to live a life of mediocrity. I just feel hopeless..."
"
					I do not want to commit suicide, but ...
				","

							I'm 17 and feel myself slipping back into depression which lead to my referral to a psychiatrist in April/May time. I finally opened up and discussed how Id always felt different and alienated, I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, which went some way to explain why I always was a strange child with many oddities my mother could never fathom."
"
					My Time's Up...
				","

							The dreaded moment I was painfully trying to avoid came; my parents no longer want me to live with them and with no money at hand, I have to live on streets. A homeless, a bum, a nobody. I have no choice to end my life pretty soon as I can't and wouldn't let myself go through this sh|t. So many things I wanted to do in my life, so many places to see but alas some people weren't meant to last and my time has come. I don't need anybody's support, frankly I can't afford it. All I want to say is that don't torment your children psychologically and emotionally. Maybe they are not srong enough to hack their way through life. Maybe they can't deal with people the way you expected them. Maybe they are not emotionally equipped to deal with the hardship of life. I'm gone but at least for those of you who will have kids, don't treat them like a dirt, don't condescend them to the point where there wouldn't be no self-esteem left in them to go through life. And worst of all I'm still scared; scared of death but I've no choice to go through with it and embrace it as a final solution to end my misery. I wish these soul-crushing feelings upon no one.

					Possible Suicide any day now..

							Ok im really stressed now. There is this person some click away so i cant help physically, anyway last few days she has beeen talking about suicide, and well shes finally saying that shes going to do it. i have tried my best, even getting my mate to help to no avail. She was ment ot be doing it today, but i managed to convince her one more day."

					Possible Suicide
				","

							My sister always seems so much in control. Always arguing with me and winning every argument against me simply because I don't like confrontations. I even attribute my passive, shy and low self-esteem to my sister's (and my mother's) manipulative, controlling and argumentitive personalities. My mother and my sister are extremely bright people, they can tell you are lying long before you finish speaking. "
"
					prayer
				","

							Does anyone on here believe in God?  I need you to pray for me, and mean it.  I know God will only listen to those close to him, which I am not.  I need someone to pray for me who is close to God so that he can hear my prayer.  Please.  Just pray that I can survive long enough to get away from here.  I just need a few more years, and I don't know if I can go on because things are so hard, they are just so hard.  I'm so tired.  I just need a break from everything I am living with."

							I have to live up to alot of expectations from my family. I hate them for it. I suffer from servere depression. I cut. There was a while ago when i was suicidal. Ive started to slip back down that way. I really cant say anything to my parents though. I cant just admit myself to a mental hospital either because they would visit and been ashamed that i didnt carry on with my further eduction and job. It's too much stress. Ive been so down that i started to do solvents. Ive also been cutting much deeper. I kinda want to talk to someone but i cant bring myself to. Im afraid. My friends wont help me out either. Is there any way that i could go somewhere and get help without my parents finding out?


"
"
					too much
				","

							I had a plan. Outlined one hundred percent on how I was going to do it when the time came. It was my comfort, knowing that I could get out, knowing that I had this plan of suicide. It was on paper, three pages, and on it had outlined suicide notes, for my mom, dad and brothers and two friends of mine. About a week ago, I burned it. And haven't had anything to hold onto since. I cut, a lot and have for the past four years and in the past week have cut every day, which is something I haven't done in three years. "
"

							I can't feel anything. It's gotten worse and worse and now all I can feel if I feel anything at all is pain. so I really prefer not feeling anything at all which is what it has been 99% of the time anyway."

					depression on and off
				","

							Over the past year or so, i've been seemingly going through these cycles, some weeks im fine others really down, cutting my arm, thinking about suicide. there doesn't seem to be any common trigger or anything like that. Was hoping someone could give me advice as i dont want to head into anti-depressents and that when 2/3 of the time im fine, but has anyone else experienced something like this?

					a day in the life
				","

							When I wake up in the morning, I usually think about how when I shoot myself, it will be behind my right ear with either a high-caliber handgun or a short-barrel pistol grip shotgun. I will buy a watermelon or 2 for testing. I think about how I will not leave a note since I will never be satisfied that it has explained anything. Other times, I think about writing a sentence or two. I will do it somewhere away from home, away from everybody."
"
					Hopeless
				","

							i just don't think i can keep holding on, trying to make things better anymore. because nothing i've done has worked. it doesn't matter if i'm in a relationship, have lots of friends or just a few, love my job or hate it, spend time by myself or with people i care about.. write out how i feel, or keep it to myself. it doen't matter how logically i think things through. nothing seems good or fun. the first thing i think about in the morning is killing myself, the first emotion i feel is just so much hurt. i've been skipping all my university classes because i can't bare the thought of going anywhere. i've been skipping work because i don't want my boss (who is my friend) to see how depressed i am.. i want to quit school, stop giving myself any sort of excuse to keep trying and looking for reasons to live. i won't go to the doctor. why not, you ask? what do i have to lose? whatever self respect i have left.

							I haven't been feeling very good for a few years....I'm at a very low point now... I have absolutely no friends to talk to (actually, no friends at all), I can't afford to have talk therapy/medication for depression, I can't talk to my parents, so asking them for help is impossible. "

							I went to a party the other night and there was lots of people there dancing and having fun. This girl in my science class is pretty cool came up and started dancing with me. I think she likes me a lot. She trys to get my attention way too much. She's also a big druggy who is suicidal. I am pretty much a good boy. I don't do drugs or have sex or stuff like that...but knowing that she has tried to and might try to kill herself later disturbs me and makes me sick. I tried talking with her delicately. She smokes and says it'll knock years off her life...I try to reason and say things that wouldn't provoke her to even think about stuff like that. She also has had theory before. I dont want to recomend anything cause I know she'll refuse. Overall I need help without making a mistake. I really care for her as a friend and I don't want her to kill herself.

							ok, im in year 12, and im doing my VCE which is the Victorian Certificate of Education.... its like the HSC or something.... anyway, in feb this year, my grandfather died suddenly, i was called out of school one afternoon and the next morning my mother woke me up telling me he had died. it devistated me for a long time, and caused great problems at school with friends, as i just didnt have interests in being around them. during this time, my last remaining grandparent was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and was given 3 months to live, also my father lost his job. so as u can guess i went through a lot of emotions, while trying to do my best for yr 12. my friends pretty much left me, and told me that if i ever have problems just dont tell anyone... now i know i posted a letter before saying james my best mate is the nicest guy and has always been there for me, well at this point of time, he wasnt... anyway, the thing is i lost motivation to do homework, i lost motivation to see friends, to make an effort to look nice when going down the street, to get out of bed or anything, ive been to the doctors they say i dont have depression, so its not that... but anyway, i need help to get me back on track before i competely ruin my life by not doing well with my vce... its important that i do well as my parents have spent over $50,000 for my education... i have to do well... there is no question about it... please help me be motivated... help me make it through the year, i had thoughts of killing myself, they were that bad, that after making attempts of my life and still waking up i felt like s*** i couldnt believe that i was alive and i still wanted to die.

							I thought I'd be happier,skinnie, prettier, more fun by now. Im almost 20 now and my life is just slipping by. I can help but think I should die. Ive been dealing with this since I was 16. I never imagined that I'd be such a loser. I have no friends, Im just ugly, and I wear terrible clothes. I cant even get a decent guy to pay me any type of attention b/c I am worthless. I wish I were better looking. I hate going outside. I hate looking in the mirror. Im just ready to end this. I ready for it all to be over. I just live in constant pain and depression. Life sucks. Im not saying it should be perfect. But the days just run into eachother. Nothing even remotely good ever happens. Im always waiting and looking and trying to find some way to change but it never seems to work. I dont know what to do anymore. Im in college and Im honestly just tired of going. I do my work I get through my classes but its becoming incresingly difficult to get out of bed in the morning. I have nothing to look forward to. I dont have a major, I dont have career goals. Im beginning to think I have no talent. I dont know what Im here for. Im tired of it all...I want to be happier and appreciate what I have but I dont know how.

					Dont want to live anymore....
				","

							I've come to the conclusion that my life has been a pointless, meaningless series of events, strung together only for the sheer entertainment of others to laugh at me and watch me fall. I don't want to do this anymore. I'm tired of living. I'm tired of people telling me that's how life is, how its unfair and I just need to suck it up and deal with it. Everyone around me seems so harsh, their words like acid to my skin. All they're interested about is telling me to deal with it. They don't care about my pain. They don't care about me. I don't know the point of this post. But that shouldn't be surprising since there really isn't any point to my life anyhow...

After all I've helped him out thats what he tells me. that was my only friend i had here in this city. now, i just want to die. My life is going absolutely nowhere right now, i can't find a job, i dont' have a boyfriend or any friends here. Seriously there is no reason to live. i tried to strangle myself with ap hone cord and almost passed out. I'm ready to take things to a more serious level.

Recently I've been waking up in tears because i dream of people who i love whos lives ive ruined with my existence. The more i think about my life the more I notice I am nothing btu a burden to anyone I love and care about.The one person I still care about is I dont even know how far away.

I keep trying to force myself to be happy and forget about everything, but I just can't. Everyday I hardly to get out of bed in fear of what the day will be like.

							I just feel like total crap right now and I need a place to talk and vent.  It seems like my entire life has been a complete waste of time.  Just when I think things in my life are starting to look up, everything that I look forward to is taken away.  I'm always depressed.  People always come up to me and say, ""why do you look so sad for?"" and I just pause for a moment not knowing where to begin, but I always end up telling them, ""I'm fine"" just so I won't be hastled.  And it's true I have a permenant frown on my face, even when I seem to be happy it's there.  I don't have any friends to talk to.  When I try to make new ones I scare them away or they move or something.  I've always been so alone in this world, thinking there's got to be someone here I can talk to.  But there's not.  Just myself and I'm going crazy.  What's wrong with me?  I have no purpose in life.  If things don't change I don't want to be here.  Words can't even described what I feel inside right now.  I'd rather die than feel this way.

					SUICIDE.....
				","

							last night, i took a giant step, and told my mum that I've had suicidal thoughts. we had a long discussion, and i red her my journal where I had talked about killing my self, and how I felt about it… she cried, and I cried, but she told me that she always feared that I would have those thoughts, she didn't know why, but she had a feeling because of things that I have gone through, that I would have them. But anyway, she told me shes going to get me some help, and that shes going to be with me the whole way. I wanted to tell you guys, because I know there are a lot of people in the same situation as me, and I want them to know that they can get through it.

This pain could have many sources, a break up, devorice, death of a loved one, stress from tests in school, job stress, and just genral stress in life or a number of other things."

					4 years
				","

							Well where do I begin, I am 22 and when I was 16 I got my first real girlfriend, we were young and silly together it was a good time, the best time. Well after 2-3 years things got tired and I broke it off, I thought at the time it was the best thing for both of us as we were both beginning university. Anyway within a week I missed her alot so I thought mabye her feeling the same would get me another shot. I was wrong, she had already hooked up with some guy from her work and I was dropped altogether. I went through a phase of constantly emailing her begging to get her back and even bumped into her once on a bus when I proceeded to journey with her all the way to her workplace where we agreed to be friends (this for me was just a way to get back in to the fold). Anywayher promise of friendship was never manifested and she basically made it clear I was not wanted anymore. This killed me at the time a huge pain was born and I wanted to die. Anyway I had some steady friends and I managed to soldier on applying a mask of sanity. We've not spoke for 4 years unti last week when she suddenly felt guilty for still talking to her new ex (the guy she left me for) and not speaking to me so now we're firends? I played it cool for 6 days then e-mailed her suggesting a quiet drink to catch up and she still hasn't replied meaning she wont. I also found out today that after her last breakup she had some sort of one night stand and this was a new killer blow, the climax of the tragic movie where she runs back to me after seeing how bad things are without me didn't happen. She done the right thing and evolved into a notch on a bedpost. None of this would be a problem were it not for the constant numb pain and the ill feeling everytime I see or hear from her. I still live with my parents but I now see three options. End the pain using the most definite methods, leaving the country or........no make that two options. My only question is, is 4 years a natural term of breakup pain? I expected to have moved on long ago yet I still pine and think of her everyday. I would appreciate opinions.

							My wife and step son moved out about a year ago, because she said she couldn't handle my anger and mood swings any longer.  I seem to get angry at the drop of a hat about the most trivial things.  Since then I have become extremely lonely and isolated.  I grew up as an only child and it is very hard for me to socialize with others.  My wife keeps telling me that she loves me and will come back if I get a handle on my anger and mood swings, but I don't seem to be able to."

					I could die tomorrow.. but how is that different from today?
				","

							I don't understand this anymore. All this mess seems as if it were made for me. I hardly know why I am writing this, perhaps it is to try to make someone care for me, anyone. For when there is no one that listens to your cries, your pleads, there is nothing left to move on or prove. I have nothing, thereforeeee I am, nothing. In this world of violent decay and rancid blood pouring from all our lies, what am I to love or cherish? What am I to believe in? What is there here? I will be dead in 60 or less years, we all will. There is nothing to save us, we are all like the stars, we are alone in the universe, there are others there, we are afraid just floating in our empty vaccuums of time, then we shine so vibrantly, but only before we die. It is a world, and what a world. A world where you can slit your wrists, and carve your skin, only to see the next sunrise. The sun rises red with the blood you have shed upon it, and it hates you. Everyone misses the sun, but you or I will not be missed. Faith is never enough reason to believe everything, or anything will be okay. Nothing in this world ever changes, everyproblem is always replaced with a new decay. Whilst all the while your vacant heart smoulders from the fires of hell  you have placed in, within a world, within nothingness. Broken, tattered, shamed. The only reason we are here is to die. The only thing I have is death, so tell me, someone in this forsaken earth, tell me... how can anything be okay again... what is wrong with me... what is happiness... why should I live? For the many hours and days that passes me by, all these deceiving seconds turn into minutes and years, I get older, but as I do I fear I am closer to my end. For who really cares whose stupid life is lost? There is nothing here to miss me. I can kill myself now.. because I'm dead in the eyes of this tainted world.

							The possibility of failure is too much for me; I really don't want to live anymore. I've been deluding myself with grandeur visions of law school, or grad school when it's not going to get any better. I might transfer to a different school, but it won't matter much. I just don't want to try anymore, I don't want to acknowledge failure any further. I don't know if I will be able to do it, but I know I don't want to live anymore. I think I need help, although I don't know who to talk to. No one really understands me. It is a selfish act because my family would be devastated, along with a few friends, but I really don't want to live. Typing this is simply an acknowledgement of my recognition of failure, frustration and feeling of dejection. The only way I will be content with life is if I have a challenging and satisfying job, and by the looks of it, I'm not even sure if I'll make graduation. I just want out. It may be a narrow view, but only if I can turn my life around can I be happy and I'm not sure if I can do that. I've tried in the past and it didn't happen; the probability for future success is just as slim. I want out.

I can't do a job  because I'm much too afraid of getting fired, or learn how to drive because I'm afraid of failing. I want to be an actor, but I'm also a writer. I've even written a 132 page movie script. All my mother does is yell at me. I only leave the house about twice a week. I never know if women find me attractive because I'm too afraid to even talk to them. (I'm 6'1, dirty blonde hair, hazel eyes. If women find this attractive, they sure have a funny way of showing it...by not doing anything at all). So I feel like my life is absolutely cruddy. My closest friend doesn't even want to hear about it when I'm depressed and ends up not talking to me for a few days. I feel useless and good for nothing. All I have are my books, my music, my movies..but the things I want the most, a loving relationship, the ability to do what I love doing and get paid for it, happiness, independence...it all seems so out of reach with every passing day."

							All my life there's been something wrong. As a child I was tormented in school, sexually abused, and had extreme verbal abuse and some physical abuse at home. My marks were strait a's. I would come home and all my parents would say is that I could do better. I was never good enough, no matter how hard I tried. In grade 9 my parents decided we were all going to move, for no reason either. My dad wasn't going to switch jobs or anything, and there was nothing this new place could offer but a ""fresh start"" as my mother put it. Some fresh start- my whole life restarted pretty much. A new home, new school, new friends, a new life; I had no say in the matter what so ever. In the months before the move I became anorexic, trying to grasp at least one thing I could control- my weight. My best friend Kat helped me through it and I began to realize I had feelings for her that exceeded friendship. She introduced me to God which helped me through all of this....the pain went away. My faith is what saved me here. "

I just wish people would consider what an impact they have on the community around them. The first kid didn't just affect his own friends and family, but everyone who knew his friends and family, and everyone who had any ties to the other kids who committed suicide. It has been extremely depressing to see my entire school and community in mourning. It's awful that these people felt so alone, because maybe things could have been different if they had only known just how many people cared about them."

							I dont know whats wrong with me..I have a boyfrined a good family enviorment and friends. Its just i feel like i havent actually got ne one to talk to or rely on. What ever my boyfriend does i find a way to have an argument. Whats wrong with me. when im in a car i often find myself wishing we would crash  and i would die. I constantly ache and cant bare the pain i feel ne more im not mad just sad. I always have had difficulties with my boyfriend people accusing him of cheating etc and also my bestfriend has and does lie to me so this doesnt help. I hate myself too.....i think im fat and ugly and although no one knows i often dont eat for days, just so i dont out on weight i hate eating cos i can feel myself becoming more and more fat. I hate my life and wish more and more everyday that i was dead.

					Why is it so important to everyone for me to keep living?

							Why does everyone want me to keep living whenever so much hate for myself and life.I have no life whatsoever.I havent been seeing my friends much lately,Ive never had a gf or any girl relations,im failing out of school because of depression and the fact that i hate going to school to see stupid teenagers day after day again.I find no point in my life.What is there to live for?I have tried to commit suicide before because i sa no point then either.My family is screwed up and i always get yelkled at by my mom for strange reasons.Mostly what i do is stay hours on end playing video games all day long whenever im not doing things with my friends.Girls ahve called me ugly and i have had no girlfriends which makes me think that i am ugly.My friends constantly put me down and make fun of me teasing me too.I have no life i am a loser.I constantly suffer from depression and im bi-polar which makes it worse.I am not good at anything.Not even these games i play hours on end.People constantly beat me on games and i have never been good at anything.I always have some friend who is a lot better then me.Can someone give me one good point to me living that is good about me??Cause i cant seem to find something good out of my life.

							my favourite quote at the moment is ""well im gona die sumtime, y nt make it now"". nobody in my life has ever taken me seriously everybody thinks im just an attention seeking fake. it hurts. ive bin a self harmer for 2 years and a drug-abuser for 6 months now. in the beggining this stopped the pain but my pain is becoming to powerful and overwhelming that i dont know what to do anymore. i told my friend that i felt like dying, i told her i think my existence is slowly fading. i brought extra drugs the other day, i was gona take them as an overdose but i bottled it. i really regret it now i want to die so much i  actuly get an adreniline rush when i think about it. i have nobody to talk to in this world and im completely alone. if there is any1 out there that feels the same please talk 2 me. i need to know im not alone..........please

							Here I am once again. I think the last time I posted on this board was over a year ago and that was about a relationship of mine that went terribly wrong. It's been more than a year since then and to be quite honest, nothing has improved, it's only grown worse since that time."

					Why is it like this...
				","

							I can honestly say that if it wasnt for the fear of the pain of dying, i would be dead right now.  Nothing in my life goes right, im currently in the process of applying for college, and i feel so much pressure from my parents to do well and to make something of my life that it alone is driving me crazy.  That isnt even close to the worst of it  thought, the worst part is my relationship with a girl who i met this summer.  I met her and i quickly fell in love with her but it was at camp so of course after it ended we had to go back to our own homes.  She lives many hours away and i almost never get to see her.  I recently took a trip down, and sitting in the movies just holding her hand i have never been happier.  Ive never had a girlfriend ever and she is the first girl i ever even loved but because of the distance she believes we cannot commit to a serious relationship and i see her point.  The whole situation is killing me and i dont know what to do or how to get over it.  All i want is to be with her, and i just cant have it, and with all the other pressures on me like school, work, family, and college,  i just cant take it, im lost looking for a point to my life but i dont even know if one exists.

					Prozac linked to suicide -- warning
				","

							Today in school we were having discussions about current events going on in the world.  We started talking about how water over in the UK drinking water is contaminated with the anti-depressent drug known as Prozac.  A large portion of people in the UK take Prozac ( I think around 30% of the population) and the water and sewage treatment plants do not recognize Prozac so they do not try to take it out of the water (although they are now going to star upgrading the facilities).  If you drink enough water you will feel the effects of the Prozac.   Also, since Prozac hasn't been around very long, doctors are just finding out now that when younger children take Prozac it causes them to have suicidal tendencies ( I dont know how young they mean.. teens? preteens? younger?)  There have already been lawsuits against Prozac by families who have lost their children to suicide related to the drug.  I dont want this post to get lengthy so I'll just finish up.  If your pregnant you might not want to drink the tap water (drugs are bad for the baby), and if you're young you might not want to drink it either.  Buy some bottled water      I hope this helped some people and brought knowledge to others."

					Looking for some answers... hopefully
				","

							Hey, this is my first time posting on here. I'll just get straight into things. I often suddenly go into a mood of depression for no aparent reason and when I do it is serious depression. I have attempted an O.D before by taking 48 pain killers at once. I heard 20 of them would do so I had to make sure. That day at school was very emotional. I survived and was ill for 4 days with what my parents believed to be food poisoning. I become very lost in my own thoughts wondering what I am going to do with my life and whats the point in doing anything when we are just going to die? All this could not be worth it. Everyone says things will get better. Yeh they get better for maybe a day or a week, then a big 2 months of utter depression and suicidal thoughts comes and steam rolls them happy times and always unbalances them. Also I often think about very bad depressing things like what I would feel like if my mum was to die or I empathise with people and then feel their pain and suffering which drags me down even more. I lie awake at night for hours on end thinking about everything bad under the sun, thinking how can it all end, what do I need to do before I go. This doesnt help as I only get 2-4 hours sleep a night so the tirdness adds on again to the almost monitinous pile of things that is wrong with life. I can't turn to my parents as they will most certainly not take me seriously and I do not think I would have the confidence to say anything to them. Some respondance fast would be very helpful. Even just an insight into why I am like this. I have thought that I may have real psychological problems but then again I also think that it could be a case of me just reaching out for some attention which frustrates myself even more because I can't stop myself feeling like this. Well thats it...

							ok so i have used this forum for my own needs. trying to get back my ex whom i thought i needed soooo much. well, last night or rather 3am on sept 15th i got a rude awakening. I was trying to sleep in my room when my dad hollered for me to go into the kitchen. my parents who i am staying with temporarily had been having a dia=sagreement for the better part of the night but, seemed to be keeping it mildly toned. i was not prepared to walk in to a room where my dad is asking me to have my mother ""tell me"" what she has swallowed because she refuses to inform him. he is holding her in his arms she is barely able to stand yet she is trying to push more pills into her mouth. not a very easy attempt considering my dad is bear hugging her. so, i start asking she starts refusing. my dad asks her to let him drive her to the hospital. she starts saying that she just wants the pain to end. it gets foggy to me here..... but all i hear is her say that it is her personal choice to do what she wishes with her life. you want to know my answer to that? ok well, i'm making a personal decision to pick up he phone and dial 911 instead of try and talk a not so mentally stable person into going to the hospital. i'l llet the paramedics do that. how am i able to sit here and type this? dont ask me maybe its because im in shock that my mom would do this and i havent quite let it sink in. who mind you at 25 really wants to deal with their mother trying to quit on life? a little discussion could do me good right about now. i dont think when a person sets to ending it all they realize that they arent just ending it all for them. someone loves them unconditionally and even if they dont see it they need to be aware of it. i make no apologies for my actions. and it was extremely hard to look  my own mother , whom i love more than i love anyone, and tell her i made that call. i wont back down on it. because while my dad was trying to negotiate extremely crucial time was going by. ok anyone thoughts??????

							I dont see the point in this, why feel something fake? I constantly feel suicidal and depressed for a number of reasons i have explained before. But to force emotion is to lose identity and life. You know that there is something to live when you feel, its wen you feel nothing inside as i have experienced when you are really low. And even  then you should never take medication to fix things, you either get through it and live or cave into it and die. that is life, how we die.

Luckily a friend talked her out of it and she dropped the knife. She cuts almost every night just hoping that she will one day cut too deep, though she doesnt cut on any major veins cuz if her parents find out she will be sent to a hospital. She is such a wonderful person and I just want to know what to say to her! I tell her she has so much going for her but she just doesnt see it. I tell her people love her but she said she doesnt care if she hurts the ones that love her when she dies. I just dont know what to do and immeidate response would be nice because I'm really scared.

							this is for all of you that want to kill themselves, i know what you are going through. i wish i was dead to... or at least i did because i just lost my girlfriend for good and she was the only thing i had. but anyway think about this before you do it, picture that you really did die, think about how you would feel never being able to see your friends, or maybe someone that you love. think about that, suicide wont get rid your problems you will just lose everything you have or see. just yesterday i overdosed on amphetamines because my girlfriend broke up with me, luckily i didnt die and now after thinking about what i just wrote i dont want to kill myself. I just cant think about never seeing the people in my life again, it makes my stomach upset. just think about the things you do before you do them... i learned this the hard way.

							Well don't worry I've never caused myself any injury and I don't plan on it....but the thing is I find myself contemplating suicide a lot. I just play out the scenario in my head...how, where I would do it..but mostly I think about everybody's reaction to it. When you know someone well enough you can predict their reaction to many situations. Most of the people I don't want them to go through the pain I predict they would have...but there's sometimes where I want some people to feel it. I want them to feel guilty. One scenario I figured leaving a note telling a certain someone it's their fault, so they would be left with the guilt."

							So why is it that several times per year it seems I find myself in the same situation? When I climb out of it and put it behind me I feel temporary happiness which is just that, temporary. The cause every time thus far has been the opposite sex. Not that I've had bad women, quite the opposite, just that every complication that I couldn't have imagined has become my life. I've just now finally realized that women are the same as cocaine, expensive and make you feel great, but not permanently and coming down is much much more painful than any drug I've come accross. Women aren't the sole cause, they just end up escorting me to rock bottom once you pile on the realizations that people are selfish ignorant garbage as a quick generalization.  "

							I feel like I'm drowning in my everyday. I'm 29 years old and a single mother of 2 sons, 10 and almost 5. I have been through my father dying at a young age, dropped out of HS to get prego and go on welfare with my alcoholic husband that I kicked out several years ago. I then rebounded and had another child. I'm now living at my mother's house for past year and a half, going to college for past almost 4 years and only have about 6 more months to complete my BS in Public Administration. I have my AA in Criminal Justice already but I have no idea why I ever went into school. I'm many thousands of $'s in debt and can't so much as afford shampoo let alone a bill 'cause I can't get any hours at work. I'm a writer and for years have been trying to get published with no avail. I'm having issues with the state over child support with the kids. One dad's trying to get $ from me even though I have our son 75% of the time. I have been drinking more and more lately    and have eaten potentially 1800 calories worth of food in the past 6 days and nothing tastes good to me anymore. I was cornered by a friend of mine 2 days ago because of my depression. He took away my keys to keep me from going out to drink more so I proceeded to hit him enough that my arm and knuckles hurt now. He called my sis and bro in law and had them come to get me. It was humilliating. That only taught me not to tell anyone close how I really feel. I met a man 3 months ago whom I fell in love with and now with no warning, and supposedly because his ego won't let him allow me to pay for things when he's broke, he broke up with me via email of all things. I have been given a never-ending supply of anti-depressants from my DR., about 7 months ago, but have stopped taking them. I have Multiple Sclerosis and have stopped taking my weekly injections as I can't do it myself and missed seeing my friend who does it for me last week. I believe the only thing in my life that's kept me from suicide many other times are my children. There's no one else for them but me. I still make last-second decisions every day to avoid swerving my car  ](*,) into on-coming traffic. OMG, help me please..........

Then as usual right at the wrong time turns up LOVE. me n a guy called James started hangin out together he knew about my problems but he didnt mind i was so happy that for once sum1 wasnt judgin me for it.   but i fell deeper and deeper w/ him and i love him soo much then he sees sum of the cuts on my wrists and gets all patronisin sayin stuff like ""u dnt need to do that u only do it for attention coz u want sum1 to pity u"" That night i cried so much and cut again.we made up but jus recently hes told me he doesnt love me any more and just wants to be friends i dunno what ive dun. all i konw now is that the only 2 ppl i have ever trusted in my life have let me dwn they wernt there wen i needed them the most and now i c no point in livin and really want to die but i dnt no how to do it coz everytime a pills goes nr my mouth i wanna thro up    how can i put myself ut of this misery

							I recently had my beautiful fiancee end our relationship after four years of being together.     Well, it was entirely my fault, I never appreciated how wonderful she was to me, and didn't realize what I was doing until it was too late.  Two nights ago, I tried to end my life with a megadose of Ambien, Tramadol and alcohol.  I ended up vomiting all over the place and sleeping for about 36 hours, and making her even more angry at me.  The amount of stuff I took would have killed anyone else.     It sound ridiculous I know, but the loss I feel is incredible.  We have a home together, with three kids (all hers) and two cats.  I have lost my family, and don't know where to turn or what to do.  I know that when I move out, I will lose her forever.  But if I don't get away from her, I will drive her away more.  Everyone keeps telling me that I am not alone in my pain, that many others have gone through the same thing.  But you know, that doesn't really make anything feel any better.  I just feel like trying to kill myself again.  I can't stop crying, and it feels like there is no hope for me anymore.  I will never enjoy another Christmas (our anniversary), never enjoy going to the beach again (that's our place), all the happiness is just gone from everything.     From anyone who has been through something similar, how do I make the pain go away?  How do I make it better?  I am so lost...

							everyday i plan out a new way to kill myself, each time i become more efficient and come closer to carrying out the plan.  i want to die, i do not enjoy life in the slightest way.  nothing is enjoyable for me, except this one girl, but since she is in love with my best friend i gave up on her.  i dont know what to do, im never happy, i cant remember the last time i laughed without having to physically and painfully try.  i am happy when i am around the girl, but that only makes it worse because when she leaves i remember how she does not love me the same as i love her, i feel like a wuss, i often cry myself to sleep, i often scare the crap out of my friends with sudden outbreaks of rage or sorrow.  its ruining my life. im 15 and i weigh around 90 pounds, i havent had anything to eat for three days now.  im not anorexic or anything, im just not hungry.  i cant sleep at night.  i hate humans.  they all just have so many problems.  nobody wants to be around me because im always so melancholy.  someone.  please.  anyone help me.

							i'll be 17 in about a week...ive been depressed i guess for the past 3 ish years. in and out of eating disorders. major problems with confidence and never a stable family environment. doesn't seem like it will ever get better. i wish i would stay b/c im so in love with my boyfriend of over 2 years. but at this point there is really no point to me being here. i even picked a day that i would do it, wrote letters, but yesterday was that day. the reason i didn't do it was because our community had a suicide a couple days eariler and i wanted to give people time before they dealt with another one. (itll be the 3rd this year). so yesterday i was kind of mad at myself for not going thru with it, and cut myself. (im a cutter occasionally, usually when im numb) i picked a new day. May 26, 2004. those numbers equal 17-my age. i know i sound crazy, but what's the point of being here if im always gonna be upset, and my friends are too caught up in themselves to reach out. i dont want to tell my boyfriend b/c i know id scare him. he already has too much to deal with. but im hurting, and i dont know whether or not to tell anyone. i dont know if i for sure wanna do it, but it feels like the only way. i just want out. what should i do? yes- i already see 2 therapists (one in school, one out) no i have not even hinted to my suicidal thoughts. dont want people to know so they try to stop me i guess. i dont know. help.

							Hi.  I'm not accustomed to telling my story to such a wide audience, so I may ramble just a bit.  I'm 17 years old and living a a fairly good life.  I make straight A's, I'm involved with the Boy Scouts as a vollunteer (love it) and I tutor some.  Great, right?  Aside from my textbook over-achiever life, I'm also gay and depressed about it.  I have no desire to be a homosexual, I never asked to be one, and would gladly trade it in for some other horrible defect.  However, I am stuck with it.  This is a problem, because my entire life focuses on two major goals: be active in Scouting and have a career in education.  I can't do either one in my current state.  Right now, consider yourselves quite privleged because you know more about my sexuality than even my parents do, and I really can't bring myself to tell them.  For the past few months, I've started thinking more and more about really killing myself.  I have perfect access to a gun, and I have also considered mixing aspirin and a few other things.  I'm not prepared to face the remainder of my life, which could be quite long (I don't have any foreshadowing illnesses) as a gay man with no direction in life.  I want to either achieve my two goals or forget about them and die.  Am I shutting out my options?  What AM I doing?  I can consciously talk about this problem, but I don't even know what it is that's bothering me so much or how to go about solving it.  All I know is that death would rid me of all these things.  If I'm wrong, tell me so.  I could use the information.  I don't mind email, but replies are better.  Any response would be appreciated.  Thanks.

					I just wanted to be loved...that's all.
				","

							I am 31 years old and I just don't want to be here anymore.  Ever since I can remember I have been praying to die.  I have been abused in every possible way by the people that were supposed to love me the most.  Now that I am married I thought that I could put all of that behind me.  My husband treats me badly.  He hits me the way my father did.  Choking me around my neck slamming my head up against walls.  He verbally abuses me to.  He cheated on me and he acts like he is very proud of it.  He told me that he knows he can do it again and I will never leave him.  He and the women he cheated on me with are still in contact.  They call me and  laugh at me because I am hurt and he says so what get over it.  He also tells me daily that he does not want to be with me he wants a divorce.  He has the resouces to get one but wont.  I am believing that he says this to hurt my feelings.  I really dont want to get divorced because I love him.  Maybe I am stupid.  I don't trust him or anyone else, because when I do people always end up using me and treating me badly.  I am a good person with a good heart and I always treat people with respect and love.  I just wish someone could love me.  That's all I ever wanted was someone to love me.  Love me not for what they can get from me or what I can do for them.  I have some many times put people ahead of my own needs only to have them spit in my face.  Maybe God does not want me or want me either that is why he hasn't answered my prayer.  I was a little girl praying for him to take me away and he never did.  He made me go through all that pain and now I am hurting again.  I would be lying if I told you that I have not attempted suicide.  I am thiunking about it right now.  I am tired of people using me and yelling at me and treating me as if I have no feelings.  My husband said that he has better things to do than worry about my stupid little feelings.  Maybe my father was right..I was never gonna amount to anything.     I should just end it myself and make everyone happier.

					Got laid off, lost girlfriend, now losing house!
				","

							I got laid off the week before Christmas from a very good job that I thought would be safe. Got some severance pay, but it's all gone. Part of it was spent on helping my long-time girlfriend pay for her car repairs. Well... a couple of weeks ago, she dumped me - saying she needed to have her ""self-esteem"" back. It was a total surprise. I suspect she is dating another guy - she works at a store where she meets lots of guys. It hurts like heck, but I have no desire to find out. No desire to cling and beg either. I am too tired to deal with that crap, I have so much trouble focusing on finding another job. And then, with her gone, the house will soon be gone because I have no income. Unemployment is a joke and will run out very soon. As far as the job search, the competition is intense. I've been invited to only one interview so far, and it was a dud."

Im sure this kind of thing gets heard every day...well, I dont really care I guess.  Im a nineteen year old college student, and I should be a happy, outgoing, person..like I used to be not so long ago.  Three months ago (give or take), I began to experience strange feelings I had never felt before, I didnt want to leave my dorm room, i shunned my friends, I began withdrawing in general.  There was no reason for these things to happen, they just did.  I was the type of person I suppose most people in this kind of state despise.  I was the quarterback jock in high school, very popular, always ready to party and hang with friends.  Now, one year into college, I am on the brink of ending my life, for what reason I have no idea..all i know is that I have a pain inside of me that grows with each passing day, and no amount of medication, drinking, smoking, or partying will make it go away.  My thoughts have been increasingly suicidal to the point where I wrote a six page suicide note last night.  "

							It doesn't help though. It just makes me more sad to know life is unfair to so many people.  I am so tired.  So emotionally tired.  I wake every morning in pain, going on only because I have to for my kids.  I pray every day that today the hurt will stop, and it never does.  It just keeps getting worse.  In my mind I understand depression, stages of grief, yada yada....but that does nothing to help my heart.  I thought, once, i had found the answer, i had found a happiness i could keep.  Now i just feel like the butt of Go's jokes.  I feel like I am being punished.  Every move I make is wrong. Every attempt I make to heal only causes more pain.  I am so ready to give up.  I pray for death to take me while i sleep.  I can't find the answers.  People tell me they are within me...but i have looked, tried, they are not there.  I am alone in the world save those two kids.  They are the only reason i go on...and sometimes (and it only makes me feel worse) i resent having to go on for them.  It's worse because I see those who hurt me go on to be rewarded with happy lives.  They can go on and I am stuck...lost....trapped in my own grief and hurt and unable to fight my way out.

There was maybe one year in my life where I was happy and I had friends. It was like a year after I started taking my anti-depressants. But I was so stupid then and my friends weren't really into the whole girl thing yet. Now I still hang out with those same friends (like sit at lunch etc.) but I never talk now. They see me as some loser. They're always asking me 'would you hit that' and I always answer yeah. If they knew I was gay, it would be so much worse. I don't know if my parents know I'm gay. Sometimes I get the feeling they do. My parents are split up though. I live with my Dad and his girlfriend. I have a sister, a brother and a step brother. I don't really get along with any of them. Well sometimes we joke around but I can't actually hold a real conversation with any of them. Not even my Dad or his girlfriend. I can't hold a conversation with anyone actually. I'm always scared and when you scared while you talk, you can't think of anything to say. I have a really bad social anxiety disorder. So anyway, I've never had a girlfriend and I guess I have no friends either. I don't talk to anyone. All my teachers say I'm quiet and when they put the spotlight on me, I get so nervous. I hate going to school because I'm so ugly. I hate walking around where people can see me. I'd feel more comfortable wearing a paper bag over my head. I've tried to look better but everytime I try (to loose weight) I always fail. It never works for me. I have no job either.  I spend most of my time on the computer. It really makes me angry when people tell me I have to try harder, get out more, go explore....i wish people would just realize that it's not that easy.  There are so many things that will just end up stopping me from doing that.  I've tried it. I'm scared now because I don't see myself going anywhere in the future. I hate when people say ""do you plan on having a family' and I can't have a family. I'm gay. Even if I decide to have one, nobody will accept it. And plus...how could I ever have a family being as anti-social and ugly as I am?  So I think about killing myself a lot. Right now, I know deep down I wouldn't do it now because I'm afraid of death but I'm afraid that something is going to fuel me to really do it one day. The combination of problems I have isn't a good one. I mean sometimes I wake up and say to myself 'today I'm going to have a great day and change everything' but then you realize...what's the point? If I fix one thing, there are going to be so many things that I'll never be able to fix. EVER."

					Is death the answer?
				","

							Life just sucks for me. My parents just yell all the time and never listen to what i have to say.  life out side my house is so lonely even though someone of my so called friends ask me to go out i just feel like sitting at home feeling bad.  i just sometimes want to kill myself but dont have it in me but i have so much hatred with in myself.  i hate my life and i hate everyone around me.  it seems my goal in life is to make everyone miserable around me. the other part is the question about god, does he really exist? Or is he just something that we can hold on to have hope that there is something after death.  feel so alone....like one can feel the sadness the way i do...

							Hi, all:"
"
					I want to kill my stupid life.
				","

							First i need to let everyone know what started my depressionl and i will do just that.  I had a girlfriend i met on the internet about 5 years ago. Ever since then we've always saw each other every 4 months. She was my first girlfriend, my first love and i lost my virginity to her        and the same goes with her too. I was her first everything. Things were going great up until july the 18th when she broke up with me. I begged and pleaded her not to and that i loved her with all my heart and soul. but she didnt seem to care. So 2 weeks goes by and i havnt really talked to her so i get this crazy idea and sell all my stuff and had my friend drive me to see her in arkansas. She then took me back and said she was impressed to see i would drive all the way to see her. So i stayed there for a month and my friend drove home back with his girlfriend that went with us. so on october the 5th i go home.November the 17th she tells me she wants to break up because of things arnt working out. before this 2 weeks she met this guy at this dance club. and has been hanging out with him. after the break up 1 week later she is going out with him....she tells me she is alot happier now that she doesnt have me in her life....ever since the breakup ive had feelings of     guilt,depression,anger and suicide. I'm not doing very well at all. I'm always depressed and sad....i try to make friends with girls but they dont like me      no girls like me im very ugly and sick looking.  I dont have a car or anything so i can never go anywhere     my whole life is crap. i have nothing going for me and i really hate myself for letting this happen...in which i mean letting her breakup with me. Its all my fault i let this happen and i just feel like punishing myself and try and kill myself for what happened. Now i cant be happy    how could i be so stupid and let the best thing walk out on me? im very stupid and i hope i die real soon.

							Lastnight i was talking to my friend and i could tell something was wrong cause he wasnt acting like he normally does. I asked him whats wrong n he said nothing,so i was like ok and we talked for a little longer before i asked him again if he was sure nothing was wrong.He said he wasnt so i asked if he wanted to talk about it and he said maybe...not,but then he had to go.So i was talking to him again today and i asked if things were better.Of course,he said nothing was wrong,but i knew something was.He eventually told me there was,but he wouldnt tell me what it was. And then he got mad at me becuase i kept asking him to talk to me about it cause i care about him. Well he changed his name to ""Sometimes I cant take this place,sometimes its my life i can take"". This isnt the first time this has been his name.About a month or so ago was the first time i saw it. I asked him to promise me he wouldnt do something so stupid and he said no. I started to cry n asked him if he was seriously considering it and he said obviously.He wont tell me whats wrong,and he doesnt want to talk about it with me...what am i supposed to do?!If i dont know whats bothering him then how am i supposed to help. I dont want to bug him about telling me cause what if i make him mad and he kills himself,but i dont want to back off cause then he might think i dont care,and i do. Can someone please give me some advice on how to deal with this,and how i can help him get through whatever hes going through?I would appreciate it so much.

					I've been having suicidal thoughts lately
				","

							Lately I've been depressed and have been having suicidal thoughts.  Overall my life is good, I live on my own, I have a job and I'm going to school so overall life is good.  The problem is that my love life is horrible.  I'm 26 years old and ive never been on a date in my lfie and nver had a girlfriend.  I'm too shy to approach girls and I look like one of those guys on ""Average Joe"".  I am losing my hair, skinny, wear glasses and just feel like no girl would ever want to go out with me.  I can't even look a girl in the eyes anymore.  I have no self-esteem, no self confidence in myself and every girl and I mean every girl that I like and want to get to know more has a boyfriend and I'm getting to the point where i think that God created me to be single all my life and to never be in a relationship with a girl."

					Husband and Daughter having thoughts of suicide. Overwhelmed
				","

							Feeling very overwhelmed with family problems.  I feel like I'm trying hold up this huge weight all buy myself and if I drop it the family is going to be crushed.  I'm a 35 yr old female with 4 kids.  My husband is 38 and was diagnosed with 40% ptsd back in 1995.  He can be a real bear most of the time.  He has really bad outbursts when stressful situations arise and he can be really mean.  Last month he threatened to kill his self.  He took his gun from our closet and took off for 2 days.  He was so mean about it.  It wasn't like I'm so depressed I'm going to kill myself, it was like ""I'll show you and you'll feel bad for the rest of  your life"".  He even hand wrote out his will and gave it to me.  I managed to get him home and calmed down and he seems o.k. but not better.  He doesn't want to seek counseling for his depression because he doesn't like the fact that when he goes to the VA hospital and gets assigned a counselor that he only has that one for only 4 months and then they change counselors on him.  He then has to go through his whole life story again and he said he's sick of it.  "
"
					what's the point of going on??

							*sigh*"
"
					I'm running on empty
				","

							I'm 25 yrs old and I'm not really sure what's wrong with me. Every doctor seems to have their own diagnosis. The most recent is that I'm bi-polar with post traumatic stress. Another noted schizophrenia with pyschotic features. The Army disqualified me for being narsisistic. The only thing they all agree on is that I'm depressed and have been most of my life. I have a history of abuse in all it's forms,originally by my father,and later by foster parents. I've always felt like an ousider and still do. I'm constantly being judged and manipulated by people that dont/cant/wont understand me and have their own agenda,my interests not being part of it. I'm on medication that helps some days,but most not. I've never succeeded at anything despite my sincerest efforts,and my attempts at relationships all end the same way,with me driving/scaring people away. I'm sick of hurting,of failing,of not knowing when the depression is gonna hit. I'm thinking about killing myself pretty regular now. I've got a few family members that claim that I dont have the ""right to do that to them"",but I think that it's only about them. If they didn't have me to push around and take advantage of,they would have to actually get lives of their own. I dont believe they honestly care. Outside of them,I have no one. I dont matter. I'm not sure what keeps me hanging on,bull headedness perhaps,but that's about gone. I'm sick all the time now,I sleep too much because I dont have anything to get up for,and I no longer enjoy old pastimes. I'm desperate.

							I have exhausted all options professional help , medication etc and yet nothing seemed to work. I have a feeling that it's only a matter of time before i resort to something in which i will end up in a whole heap of trouble eg resorting to drugs and that will get me into a lot of trouble with the authorities and my future will be forever ruined with a criminal record and i wil be physically prevented from killing myself in detention as well even though i want to do it desperately and police brutality is something that i have consider as well while in detention. I know very well that things are not gonna change and it is a sign of incompetence and stupidity when u give yourself a chance and see everything blown up in front of you eg i will be an idiot if i think positvely about the future when it is so overt that things are not gonna change. i dont think i deserve to be in this world for being so stupid either and i cant live with that coz i know very well that i am not and i think it's time to be smart and resort to the inevitable solution given all the possible scenarios. Some of you guys may perceive me as stupid for wanting to do the so called stupid and cowardly thing but it is really up to you i dont feel like disclosing some information about my background either

					I'm just a body of diseases.
				","

							Hi, I'm a new member here.  I guess I'll give a little intro of myself.  I'm 18 and am posting in this particular forum for obvious reasons.  It's amazing I've actually not killed myself yet.  In elementary school, I was always alone and wanted desperately to die.  I started starving myself way back then.  I still starve myself.  The first time I tried to kill myself I was 15 in Germany on a foreign exchange trip.  I tried to overdose but just ended up passing out.  Last time I seriously attempted was 2 years ago.  I tried to starve my body to death.  I went several days with no water or food and was simultaneously working out every day.  I'm not sure why it didn't work because I honestly don't remember what happened.  A little over a year ago I met this ""great guy"" and was quite happy ... for a little while.  It was only a few months before my depression came back.  Then, I found out this guy wasn't as great as I had thought.  We're no longer an item, but because of that, I'm in terrible shape.  He was the only person I could talk to.  I have no friends at all.  I make small talk with people at work, but that's the closest thing I have to an actual friendship ... actually any sort of relationship whatsoever."

					I hate living
				","

							I sit down here to write and I wonder why I am doing this. My life is a tragedy. Some people are just born with tragedy in their blood. The only reason I'm still alive is hope. I hope that things might get better. I don't know what is happening. My head just doesn't work right. I have never been happy. I wish I was happy. I am nothing! I try so hard to find happiness. I know I should be happy with what I have, but I hate living. I just don't want to live no more. The bitterness and anger inside me has made me hate everything. I destroy everything I touch. I can't eat. I can't sleep. I feel like I'm made of pain. My head is exploding. My brain is on the point of bursting to bits. I'm sick in the head. I feel like crap."

I tried for a while to stop for the sake of others, but...I've lived for, through, because of others for so long that it's like I'm not really here, like everything I do feels wrong. I'm trying harder and harder to only use my knife on places that my parents won't see. I don't give a f___ if the guys see them. Because of not being able to cut on my wrist (the easiest place for me to make bleed, the first place my parents look for cuts) I cut more often and in bigger numbers. I feel like if they would just leave me alone, my cutting would almost disappear. There's no way they'll ever understand how much of a hell they've made for me."

							Hi, my name is Lucy and i have posted here before. Well.....the problem is that I want to commit suicide more then ever now and I am only 18 yrs old. I can't focus, everything in life is so blurry, I haven't accomplished anything, I don't really have many friends, and i can't trust anyone anymore. I don't feel much of anything except for extreme sadness and depression. I really, really want to die. I have prayed several times to God to end my life during my sleep, but my prayer isn't being answered. I don't want to do it myself because I will go to hell if I do even though I have not been a religious person in a while. I also am extremely unhappy at home and want to get out of here. I have tried given life a chance a couple of years ago, but right now I wish i didn't. This awful pain is killing me slowly day by day. What should i do? I am at the brink of doing something.

							I once posted a message here reguarding that I have never been with a woman, even at 42 years old I still am a virgin well as my last message before I leave this planet I would like to say that the advice that was given was wrong that is what has led me to make this decision I guess after tonight I wont have to live with this on my shoulders any more. If you were one of the people that gave advice I hope you never have to give advice to some one again when some one asks to be listened to do it and dont offer suggestions on how to fix it because thats not were looking for. I struggled long and hard about what I am about to do my  mind is made up so as I end this life just a suggestion if you see some one in despair listen to them and dont offer remedies we arent asking for that so long and see you in the next life

							Hi all.  I found this forum today simply because i was bored and i typed in : I just want to die.  And i found you guys.  I dont know what to do anymore... I am 23 and a nobody, doing nothing with my life, i keep running into dead ends.   I am a single mother (the father ran off to become a heroin addict, bum, and ) and ive been through three abusive relationships in a row (and the one im currently in is being worked on, but its livable).  I live with my father and we are extremely poor, and he is an alcoholic and does drugs, and i cant stand having my son around it, not to mention all he does is rage and scream all the time.  I dont know what to do.. I cant get an apartment because i have a warrant for my arrest and i have bad credit and rental history... Ive tried soooo many times at complexes AND through independent renters, and to no avail.  All I want to do now is straighten my life up but there is no way to climb out of the hole i am in.. i got a car but i cant get a license because of the warrant, and i cant pay it off, and im afraid ill lose my son if i go to jail.  He is the only thing other than my boyfriend that keeps me somewhat sane.  I am also diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and have an eating disorder.  I think the best thing to do is just end everything, but then im afraid of what will happen to my son.  There is no way out for me, and im hopeless.  Ive tried government agencies, who just laugh at me basically... i dont want to go back to being homeless on the streets, not with my baby.  But i just cant stay here and i have no options anymore    I just want to die.  Thanks for listening.

							I am a 26 yrs old man but there is absolutely nothing for which I can love myself. I have learned that everybody has some quality in him/her self. But I could not find any in myself. Even if I have anything, that is not of much to talk about. I am physically not much strong and always suffering from some kind of physical problems…sometimes from cough & cold, sometimes from anal fissure, sometimes from flatulence. I am also not very energetic. As far as quality is concerned, I have nothing much to talk about. I cannot play musical instruments, neither  I am a good singer, I am not good in sports, I was a always an average student in my school and college, I don't have any artistic skill, I can swim but not a good swimmer. Even I don't know what exactly my hobby is and which career choice is best choice for me. Whenever I try to make a choice, everybody says that I am wrong and don't know anything. Finally either I succumb to their pressure or end up doing nothing."

							I am turning 19 on sept. 29 and not sure if i want to live to see my birthday. There is too much pain in my life and i don't care to feel anymore. All i feel is agony and pain. My heart is already shredded into little pieces and there is no cure. My mom is emotionally unstable because my dad is still cheating on her. She constantly yells at me and my brother. My dad is just a psycho that don't bring much money home because he is taking care of his other family. My mom doesn't want to divorce him. After i moved because of my mom not working because of my dad, i have left my old neighborhood and my friends. My best friend had to move away to florida because she has a baby. i have been with the same guy for almost 3 years, the only thing that keeps me alive so far. We haven't been in a very good relationship for a year and a half and argue constantly. We also had done things that hurt each other (not intentionally). My boyfriend already has his life set. I feel like a burden because i feel i am slowing him down and i know sooner or later he is going to leave me again. I love this guy to death though. i feel as though i have nobody and is being punished for something. basically, i have no friends, no family, no soul mate, and no future (didn't finish highschool). I am also dillusional and i keep thinking that i am not in my own body and keep thinking that i had a body switch or something. Please don't laugh, this is some serious stuff. I feel as though i am going insane. i am always nervous, anxious, fearful, and depressed. i hate myself, i hate my family, and i hate everybody almost. most of all i hate my mind and my so called useless piece of nothing life. i seriously am considering about suicide. i have throughout the summer, and my mental image of everything is basically psychotic. i want to jump off the roof and land on a car to show everyone the pain i feel. i don't even know who i am anymore anyway. i know i belong in a mental institute and actually don't mind going. but with what money? if god can only take my soul from my body and let me die a peaceful death.

							Ok i'm back. Some people is wondering why i am thinkin about doing that. Well i have tried to kill myself 2 times by cutting my wrist really deep. But it never happened. But here is why i wanna do that. 1. because my dad never comes around and i feel like its my fault because i was a bad kid. 2. because in the past 3 years i have had 2 friends and 3 family members die. 1 of my friends shot herself in the head. because she was on drugs real bad and she didn't have no other way out. 3. because i got kicked off the softball team and the person that told was one of my good friends. 4. because i think i'm gay 5. because i just hate my life and i don't wanna be here no more. When i was in 1st grade my teachers would send notes home asking my mom if when of my pets have died because i look so sad all the time and i think its because i'm depressed. I thought after i move to another school and make new friends that everything would be ok but its not. i just don't know what to do anymore so somebody please help me "

							yeah, can't say i ever actually wanted to be alive, no particular reason, i'd just rather be dead, (really i wish i hadn't been born, but that's a little trickier to accomplish) anywho, i don't understand the problem so many people have with suicide.i mean i understand that someone would obviously miss a loved one if they died, but yoou should try to understand, that that's what that person wanted/needed.that person may feel they are a particularily selfish,ignorant,negative,unpleasant,etc. person, and don't want to be the one who's slowly but surely destroys not only themself, but the lifes of everyone they care about through their negativity etc."

							i often feel like there is no point to my life. that i would be much better off dead. and i am so bitter about everything: past relationships, how my parents talk to me. i constantly vow that i will never fall in love again. and i cannot talk to anyone about this. my parents would freak out. the counsellors and psychiatrist i see would call the police. and well, friends are non existent. my only solace are these piles of books in my room that i don't read and dvds that aren't even out of their original packaging. anyway, my point is, there doesn't seem to be any point to my life. i am very much alone and any efforts i do make to relieve me of my loneliness is usually interrupted with school. i try to volunteer for things, and no one needs me, or the schedule is different from when they need people and when i get time off from school. i try to get some exercise, and homework needs to be done. anyway, i see no point in living anymore, and i often wake up depressed before the day has even begun. i pray to god and chant to buddha and nothing seems to come of anything i do to help myself. i often wish that i was dead, so that i wouldn't have to feel so alone and sad anymore.

To most people I have a great life, friends, nice house, parents are together, and don't no anything about how I really feel. "
,"

							Yup just as it says, I dunno if I wanna live anymore, don't really feel like. I don't really know what's keeping me from commiting suicide, but if I saw pills I would swallow them all and if I had a gun, I would put it in my mouth and pull the trigger already. I did try to commit suicide, but that was a long time ago when I was 12 b/c kids use to picked on me the whole time and one time two of them almost beat me up. That day I overdouse myself, luckly I made it. Now more than 8 years later those feelings are starting to come up again. I get nothing but bills, exams, getting step on sometimes over again, and the worst is that my girl and my first, only love, was everything to me, leaves me for the same dude, a loser."

							Hey well i do have an active account on here but there is some things i dont want my old friends to know. Well see i am suicidal and at this very moment life seems so unbearable im about ready to give up. I have spoken to only one person about just how bad it is, just one person. But still i cant open up to them. Im so scared of getting hurt, im scared of even my very best friend who is like a sister. I dont trust anyone. My friends have told me they no longer even try to talk to me because they no i wont tell them anything. One of my great friends told me that she can only joke when shes around me or talk about her problems because if we get to close to my life i just put up some sort of wall. Which is true. Im making others feel like failed friends and no matter how bad that makes me feel i still cant talk to them. My cuttings getting worse and i know that soon i'll give up if i dont get the help i need, yet how can i get help if i wont talk???? Please does anyone have an ideas on how to get over this???

							I just got a call about a half hour ago from my ex-girlfriend that just broke up with me this last week. One of our friends we haven't seen in a year came down this last weekend when I went up and got him and he had a blast this weekend. He tried calling me tonight, but I was on the phone and I ignored it like I do to anyone that interrupts an important call. I got a call from my ex-girlfriend and she told me I needed to call him right away. That he was balling and crying like she had never heard before, and she couldn't even understand a word he was saying. I called him and he was in really bad shape. He had just punched out a window and cut his hand on the glass, I made sure it was okay and not a severe wound and it wasn't. All I could hear him say was ""I'm so scared of what I might do to myself, and I really dont want to."" He comes from a family whose father walked out on them and whose mother was very abusive. He lived down here in the cities and that's how I met him. He had to move back up north because of living expenses that he couldn't come up with anymore. He's so bent out of shape, because people are telling him to give up and that he's not worth anything, and anything he does is a waste of time. Mind you, he hasn't been suicidal since before he met me and my girlfriend - he told me we are basically his only family."

							Well, it's been over a month since I've last taken my medication for depression. The initial shock of quitting cold-turkey aside, I actually feel better not on the meds than on them. I had been taking Effexor XR for around two years. Initially, yes, I think they helped. I became more active, organized, and suicidal thoughts were pushed from my mind for a while. I believe that during the final six months on the meds they actually increased my thoughts of suicide and added deranged thoughts about homicide. I remember day-dreaming about strangling people. I remember envisioning a knife held by my hand sliding into another, watching their life drain from their eyes."

							At the age of 8 I grasped the concept of suicide and realized that that would bring the relief I so desired.  ""Clinical depression"" the doctor said.  From 8 to 14 I practiced writing suicide notes on and off and trying to decide the right way to do it.  At 14 I chose to consume a half bottle of acetaminophen thinking that would do it.  God I was stupid.  I did my research and at 16, I took a full bottle of prozac, a bottle of welbutrin, a bottle of buspar, a bottle of trazadone, as well as lacerating both wrists.  I wrote, ""I can't take it anymore"" on my bedroom floor with my own blood as the world started turning gray.  I succeeded only to be resuscitated."

I exercise a lot but yesterday, at the school's fitness center, I ran into the girl I became friends with last year, fell in love with, was bluntly rejected by, and soon after hated by.  I am hated by everyone there now too - a place I have to attend for two more years.  They all look right through me as if I am not there.  Elaborate thoughts of how to end my life occupy my mind.  If I were with a therapist, he or she would ask me if I had a plan (just as their manuals tell them to ask), and if I were to be honest with them, I would say yes.  I would say a closed vehicle, carbon monoxide released via the combustion of coal.  I would say that detectors with three digit digital readouts are readily available at any hardware store.  The problem is that such detectors have only three digit readouts and I would have to take readings from outside the car and produce some sort of algorithm by taking measurements over time to predict how long it would take for the inside of the car to have 6800 ppm of carbon monoxide so that I would fall asleep in less than 30 minutes.
