0,"i cry everydayIs that normal? Do more depressed people do this? Whenever I'm alone, I cry. I'm alone a lot. As i'm writing this there's a tear rolling from my cheek. I've always been a bit of a crybaby but it has never been this much. Multiple times a day I'm crying. I cry myself to sleep everynight. In the beginning my family would notice but I think they stopped bothering. Either that or I'm really good at covering it up.",
1,"So depressed I can’t cry.It’s been a rough few months. Nothing in my life was going wrong but I had weened off of my antidepressant (on/off SSRIs for a number of years but didn’t feel great so thought I’d see what I was like off of my low dose SSRI) and was just feeling a constant depression/anxiety with anhedonia and hopelessness. Things got bad about a month ago to the point that I felt suicidal, so I stopped drinking as drinking always worsens my depression. Didn’t get much better and, a week after that, an old friend committed suicide. It was a very notable suicide for reasons I don’t wish to state and his death and funeral have been covered extensively by local news. Just constant reminders daily. I got a little choked up at the funeral but didn’t actually cry and that’s when I realized I can’t cry anymore. This is the most depressed I’ve ever been in my life and I think it is different from past lows as I’m so low, i would not ever describe it as sadness. I’m not sad. I’m completely empty and it’s a far worse feeling. I would love to cry and feel some sort of release. Just trying to hang in there until my psych appt in a few days. Wondering if anyone’s experienced the same kind of thing with crying (or lack thereof)?",
2,"I can't cry.Last time I cried a few years ago. And if I sometimes want these emotions to flow out, I can't. Anyone of you have a similar experience?",
3,"Im always sad but i cant cry anymoreLife is so tiring and everything makes me so sad but I can't cry about it. I just sit there and give up, at least crying was a good release. Now I just sit in numbness",
5,"I can't cry anymore.18 M. It's been a few years being in and out of hospitals, trying many different kinds of medications and such. I've put so much stress on my family and their time, it doesn't feel right. I know it's not something I can help, but it's still frustrating for everyone when I can't show signs of improvement. I'm wouldn't say I'm sick of it, just tired is all. I just want to die. I want to get out of this world so badly, and I can't understand it. I'm scared, but I don't have any other choice. I was 15 when this all started, and I've lost 10 pounds in 3 years when I was still supposed to be growing. The doctors say I am at an unhealthy weight for my height, talking about anorexia problems and such. I've lost the desire to eat. I haven't talked to many of my friends since graduating, and I haven't been to any graduation parties I said I would go to. I just can't care. It doesn't matter if I see them again. It just doesn't matter. I've always wanted a girlfriend, always waiting for that special somebody to come by, but I'm not capable of being a boyfriend. I want to spend time with somebody, but this world feels so empty. They say longing is the joy of being sad, so I guess I shouldn't call it that. I'm just waiting. I know there are people who will make this world feel full again, but I don't think I even want to be happy anymore. I just can't see it. I want to die. I want to die so badly, please. I don't want to feel this pain anymore, I can't take it. I dont want any comments telling me to get better, just Please tell me some painless options I can take. I don't own a gun. I'm looking for something to make this all go away. Please tell me what to do.",
6,"Sometimes, after a terrible day, i’m just in my shower, here beteween; i want to cry and please can i be in my perfect imaginary world? And... i just can’t. i can’t cry but i can’t escape reality ethier so i just stare a nothing, thinking about nothing... do you know what i mean?",
7,i cant cry...everyone says a good cry will help but the trouble is that i cant cry... a couple tears will come out and that's it! i wish i could cry! i wish i could let it all out! but i can't!,
10,"I cry myself to sleep every night because my baby was born with Down'sThere are so many emotions. This is our first baby and my husband said it will be our last because our son was born with Down's. It was something we never tested for because we weren't considered high-risk and it doesn't run in the family. I feel guilty for so many reasons. Like I let my husband down, I did something to cause this and that I probably would have had an abortion if I knew. But I love this baby so much and he's mine for better or worse. I feel angry because I'm being robbed of a normal parenthood. I drink so much that I blackout and sometimes have these dreams where my baby is born with no defects or wake up HOPING to God it was all a nightmare. &#x200B; EDIT: People who say he's a gift are the same people who said ""congrats"" when I was pregnant to ""my sympathy"" when he was born.",
11,"I cry during sexIdk what's wrong with me but often while I have sex with my boyfriend I cry. At the beginning I thought that was because I didn't wanted it but I couldn't admit it to myself but no that's definitely not it,I really want and like it. I tried searching online the answer to why would I do that, but the results were cringe, I just want to know am I the only one? I think I enjoy it, the crying, I think it's because I'm really submissive and I started seeing it as a part of the role play, but I hope my boyfriend doesn't notice this, like ever, that would be weird... Does anyone else do that ever?",
18,"[Question] Where can I cry late at nightNot close enough to my roommates to talk to them about lots of my problems, and midterms and family/friends stuff is getting to me. Just need a place a guy can go cry in peace without getting weird looks.",

25,"Does anyone take 40mg? Started at 10 a month later 20, month later 40. I feel like I’ve never been sadder but at the same time emotionless. I cry for a minute or two then I just lose emotion. No weight gain, sexually I’m horny almost 24/7 it’s annoying 😂. I have thoughts of wanting to die everyday",
29,"I cried on my first run this morning.I’ll get straight to the point. 18 months ago I had a massive stroke. I’m a 26 year old male who got diagnosed with SLE lupus when I was 21. This basically led me to having a very weak immune system. This this then led contracting the shingles about 14 months ago, which infected my brain and caused it to swell up leading to a stroke. I woke up one morning not been able to move my entire left side. Through a lot of hard fucking work and intense physio sessions I got back near total use of left side. I have been doing IF the last 6 months with tracking my calories and lost about 16kg (sorry Americans). I have been doing boxing sessions the past few months twice a week. I have always had a huge admiration for people who got up early to go running. This morning I said it’s time I did exactly that. Set my alarm for 7am to the annoyance of my girlfriend, stretched, then off I went. I had no exact plan of how far I would or could go. I knew at some points I would need to stop and walk. All I had was my ‘Map my Run’ app. When it stopped my music and said to me I had ran 2km without stopping I broke down in tears. I couldn’t walk 18 months ago, now this. In the end I ran for 3.6km in just under 30 minutes with stopping to walk for 5 minutes. I’m sorry for rambling, my girlfriend is asleep and I text my parents with excitement who are also asleep so really needed to tell someone and I hope you strangers can appreciate how happy I am right now. Edit : for the couple of people who messaged and anyone else wondering, when I say boxing it’s strictly bag and pad work, no sparring. I think my brain has been through enough lol. Also my first ever awards! Thank you so much kind strangers!",
30,"My greatest fantasy is to be tied and whipped till I cry. When that’s done, caged till my master wants to use me again. I want to be a bitch that’s collared and naked who is plugged up in all holes including my urethra. Mittens that bound me so I am helpless and at the mercy of my master.",
31,"Why can’t I cry?I never cry, I will get so sad and upset at myself to the point I’ll plan out my suicide, I’ll wish the world away. I will be so depressed it hurts my chest and stomach, but I never cry. The tears never come. I want to release this sadness. I want to cry and finally be able to express my emotions, I currently feel like I’m going to puke from holding everything in but I don’t know how to let it out",
32,"I have nothing now but praise for my life. I’m not unhappy. I cry a lot because I miss people. They die and I can’t stop them. They leave me and I love them more, What I dread is the isolation, There are so many beautiful things in the world which I will have to leave when I die, but I’m ready.",
33,"Everyone always tells me that it will get better and you’ll be happy someday. That’s a fucking lie.

34,At McDonald's yesterday there were two Karens hosting a baby shower and they wanted *only women* to serve their food for them. They screamed at a boy to make sure *only women* were allowed to serve. Apparently a bunch of people were going to show up but it was only them. I laughed so hard I cried,

36,"In highschool, after finding a photograph by William Klein, I decided to make a painting out of it. My art teacher got so frustrated with me that she told me art wasn’t “my thing” and I cried in front of the class.

37,"You have to read this! Elders sent me this email. Hahahaha I cryHere's the email: \---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear Timothy, We observe that you are really bothered for 8 months with the validity of 1914/1919 doctrine, and that it has affected your life and your relationship with Jehovah. Yesterday I talked with both br. Jonathan and the coordinator, Tom, who loves you very much, as his grandson, as his child. The opinion of all of us, and also of our elder physician, Dr. Duke, is that you have a serious problem with obsessive-compulsive behavior. Many extremely smart people like you have a characteristic or if you want a uniqueness in their brain function. They are totally focused on specific issues. So much of what goes on around them goes unnoticed. And this helps them to deal with complex issues in depth. A ""side loss"", however, is the frequent obsessive-compulsive disorder (one such case being the well-known Albert Einstein). For this reason, I ask you to reconsider in a positive way the advice given by Dr. Duke, that is to ask for help from a qualified psychiatrist. The relief you’ll feel I think will be impressive. Do not allow stupid mindsets (of the type ""you say I’m crazy now ?!..."") and the fact that you have been isolated for a long time from the congregation to prevent you from dealing with your ""practical wisdom"" problem ... (Proverbs 18: 1) It saddens me that you are so much bothered about the 1914/1919 doctrines. Does it really matter to stay away from Jehovah for some dates? But because the writing is cold, I would like we have a chat in person. On Friday I will go to Orlando to take care of my grandma. Would you like to come and have a coffee? I love you and I really want to help you. Your friend, Dimitris. \------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

43,"Why can't I cry?Background: Age: 38 Sex: Male Race: White Height: 65 inches Weight: 220 lbs Location: USA Medications: Omeprazole; Fluoxetine; Ropinrole; Buproprion; Doxepin; CPAP Profession: Attorney; combat veteran (Iraq; Army) In October, I lost four members of my family to murder-suicide. Two weeks later, my wife was raped. Two and a half months after that, my mother-in-law took her life, and my father-in-law tried to ""follow her"" (as he put it) and was in ICU for several days. All day, every day, I feel like I'm about to break down. I can *feel* the tears behind my eyes, but I just can't cry. The last time I cried was my brother's funeral almost four months ago. I want to get rid of this feeling behind my eyes. I want to cry, if that's what it takes . . . but I can't. It's maddening. As odd as it sounds, I liken it to being constipated. What can I do save for watching *Schindler's List* on loop? EDIT: Since some have asked about the antidepressants, I've been on fluoxetine for about a decade and buproprion for a few years. I also have PTSD and a traumatic brain injury from my military days.",
45,"I cry at everything now that I am a parent.My daughter is soon to be 16 months old. I have never experienced the intensity of love that I feel for her. It almost scares me! Something else I've slowly noticed, and weirdly enough it steadily intensified along with my bond with her, is that I'm crying at everything now. Pre-kid it would take a lot for me to get emotional but now, not at all. I was home on veteran's day watching daytime TV, some lady and her kids won a trip to see their husband/dad, I sobbed for 5 minutes. Before I would have been like ""Huh. Good for them, they deserve it"" and flipped the channel. I ran across that clip of Steve Irwin going on and on about his daughter, I bawled. I am constantly getting this way seeing sweet or sad stuff on TV, movies, songs, etc. Can anyone relate? I have never been one to be comfortable showing intense emotions so this is a learning experience for me but I don't mind it. It's added a depth to life I don't think I would have experienced pre-kid and I'm thankful for that. I have to laugh at myself and what a 180 this seems to have caused in the emotional part of me. Edit: Oh my gosh this blew up! Here I was on this Monday morning reflecting on how much I've grown over the past 16 months and how thankful I am for my daughter. What an absolute blessing she is... it takes my breath away. I have no idea what I did to deserve this precious little girl. Sometimes I can't believe this is my life and I took to Reddit today feeling a bit overwhelmed over it all, honestly, wondering if I'm the only one who feels like my heart is about to burst every day, all that emotion has to come out somehow and it ends up being tears for me a lot of the time. :) I had no idea I'd get this kind of response. I've smiled, laughed, cried, and done it all over again today reading through all of your responses and experiences. Thank you all! It's been such a joy coming back throughout the day to read your comments. I guess the consensus is, lots of people can relate to this, and what a beautiful ride parenthood is!",

52,"Everyone on my family believes that my depression and anxiety is part of my personality since my mom died, so they say that when i cry and try to express my feelings its just me craving for drama and attentionIts hard because one of my family members heard i was in therapy when i was a child and this person took it as a joke and “proof” that I’m actually crazy",
59,My husband got me into fishing but these were hand painted for me by my 85yo FIL. I can’t tell you how much it means to me that we get to share fishing. He gave them to me for Xmas and I cried. Not your normal fishing post but I thought you would appreciate it.,

61,"My toddler laughs when I cry or am in painMy 2.5 year old (almost 3) laughs when I show visible signs of pain or when my husband fake cries to show that my son hitting or throwing things at him hurt. Instead of showing guilt or compassion, my son starts to laugh or smile. Should I be concerned or is my concern an overreaction? How did you teach your child empathy? The reason why I feel a little more sensitive about this these days is that my son recently threw a toy at a kid (because the kid didn't want to share his toys) and the kid's nose started bleeding. Although my son looked somewhat startled and scared because the kid glared at him in response, my son still had a little anger in his eyes (he did say sorry though, upon prompting). I chalk his anger up to his language delay and being a toddler, but it still worries me. Thank you for reading!",
63,"I really cant process this one. I feel like i lost a family member. Everytime i wake up the first thought i have is ""kobe is gone"" and its the last thing i think about as i cry to sleep. I cant function like this man..i guess I just want to know theres others on here who feel like i do rnI'm 28. I remember the very first time I saw Kobe play. It was 1998 and when my older brother pointed him out to me while we watched the Laker game with my dad. He basically explained to me hes a very young player around the same age as him, and as he said this kobe had a sick breakaway dunk (one of those dunks where the ref blows the whistle but the player still dunks it on a fast break just for crowd reaction) &#x200B; I was instantly hooked. &#x200B; I was there for every moment after. The three peat, the rape case, the breakup with Shaq, the smush/kwame/mihm era...the climb back to the top with Pau. Every clutch shot, every kobe moment, every interview i tuned in...i followed him religiously. My cousins and friends would often tease me for being such a huge fan of someone i never met. &#x200B; &#x200B; I fucking cried like a little kid when he tore his achilles. But this just feels like a knife to the chest. I feel empty inside, man. And im a grown ass man but idgaf! I feel what I feel. I cant say this to family or friends but i can say this here...I feel fucked up...like i lost a real life friend or relative. I cant sleep but all I do most of the time once i get home is curl up in bed. I dont eat much, I dont give a damn about any hobbies i have. I really dont know if ill ever keep up with the nba again. Basketball is dead to me rn. &#x200B; My family or friends dont understand irl, but this man was my childhood. I cant believe this happened. What a horrible tragedy. And to have his daughter go with him? This is the worst tragedy in the celebrity world to me &#x200B; This life is some bs. Life really is a bitch. He didnt deserve to go out like this man. I really cant believe kobe is gone.",
67,"Is it weird that I cry when I dont understand homework sometimes?Like if I run into a problem, I will get mad and immediately start searching for help or answers online. When I cant find any of that I start to cry. For example if im doing math questions and I don't understand one, I cry because I dont want to move on to the next question until I get that one. I refuse to leave a question blank and go to the next one. Yeah I could ask professors or tutors for help but that takes a bit of time, and I usually want help right away. I dont want to schedule an appointment with a tutor because then I have to wait and like I said I refuse to move on until I get the question im stuck on. And then if im waiting, I refuse to do the homework so now im wasting time doing everything else but homework",
68,"Why do I cry when I worshipThis is a question I have asked, for I can’t quite help myself, and my answer is revealed throughout the Bible, yet I’m going to share with you Paul’s message to the Church of Ephesus. In Ephesians 1 lies a revealing of why tears come. It is because in Christ are we set free, having been **redeemed/purchased** by his blood, and so we have forgiveness. This redemption **reveals the wealth** of God’s grace, which he has so fully and freely lavished on us. God let us know His **secret purpose, the mystery of His will**. This was what God wanted and planned to do through Christ. His goal was to carry out his plan, when the right time came that **all things in heaven and on earth would be joined together** in Christ as the head. In Christ **we were chosen to be God’s people**, we were chosen so that we would bring praise to God’s glory. When you heard the Good News you believed in Christ. And in Christ, God put his special mark of ownership on you, His Holy Spirit. And that is but a down payment of His promise, of what we will receive from God until He gives full freedom **to those who are His**. This is the promise to all of God’s people, the saints. For a greater understanding has been put into our heart so we will know the hope to which He has called us and that we will know, to know how rich and glorious are the blessings God has promised His holy people, the saints. We will know God’s power is exceedingly; overwhelmingly great for us who believe. This is the promise to all of God’s people, the saints. For God’s people are a collective group “the saints,” and not some landmark on the ground or authority. We are those given the power to see God and hear his Word and praise Him. Many have eyes and do not see, they have ears but cannot hear, for only the chosen people of God get to know the power of true worship and praise, overwhelming or exceeding thankfulness, it’s real, it’s hart felt and it heals from the inside out. So this is why I cry, for how can I not when I have been been purchased from the bonds of sin, when I have been revealed the truth and given a promise I am not worthy of. For God chose a wretch like me, and made me into a saint.",

Once i’m somewhat “calmed” from controlled breathing, the second i feel relieved, i immediately go back to crying and being upset.

100,"My girlfriend (23f) and I (26m) have been together for 2 1/2 years and she cheated on me 3 days ago.Edit 4: final update. As you can guess by the previous two words, things didnt go well. We managed to get through a couple therapy sessions and they seemed to go well. The therapist herself said we seemed like a good fit for one another but it seems it was too little too late. She claimed she couldn't handle feeling like she did over what she had done on top of her sadness. She said I didn't try to fix things when she told me something was wrong and she wasnt happy many months ago, despite her telling me the same thing then as she did now which was that she didnt know what was wrong or how to fix it. She said she believes I could make her happy again but that the relationship we had isn't the kind she wants to have forever. Which means, her words not mine, she wants a country guy who lives a country life. She wants to hunt, fish, ride horses and do whatever it is ""country"" guys do. It's not enough that I've done and enjoyed many of the things she wants to do (though not at all with her because of where we live/our schedules and not having easy access to that kind of stuff). ""It's not who you are"" so she doesn't want to be with me anymore. I didn't want to post this because I didn't want the naysayers to know they were right. It's bad enough I've lost who I thought I'd be with forever, I don't want people telling me I told you so too. If anyone has any advice on where to go now, I'm all ears. It has been a month and 10 days since she broke up with me and I'm struggling to get by emotionally. Music makes me think of her, seeing places we used to go together a lot reminds me of her, and because of our situation she's still in my life to a small but relevant enough degree that I still have to talk to her a few times a week. I'm not sure what to do to help myself get over her. I care about her so much despite what she did to me and I want to let that go. What can I do? Edit 3: I never imagined I'd get this kind of response, I was just hoping to get it off my chest and see where that left me but I appreciate everyone's comments, especially those who shared similar experiences and how they've handled it. I know some may think of me (if we're combining all the insults and jabs at me) as a spineless pushover doormat horse, but I've decided for the time being to try to work it out. She has agreed to counseling/therapy to help find the cause of her unhappiness. Whether it's something we've already guessed or something as bad as clinical depression. She has also agreed to open, and complete honesty. No questions unanswered, nothing left hidden, no more communication with the guy at all, and to start on bettering her communication skills. She knows she's bad at communicating her thoughts and feelings about love and relationships, that's something that has changed since she had been so down as we used to be the happiest couple you could ever find. Once we determine the cause if the unhappiness or if this ends in tragedy before then I'll return with an additional update. I'll do my best to get to all the comments I deem helpful. Sorry guys telling me to dump her and move on, your comments are a dime a dozen so I'm not going to spend my time answering them all, even if they are what turns out to have been the best idea. I came here for help and advice in making it work. To those who came and have offered advice and their take on the situation I sincerely appreciate the response and hope they help me in some way. Thanks again for everything, see you soon hopefully with good news. Edit 2: It seems that I have left some stuff out, so I'll address it here. All the statements concerning Trickle truthing are wrong regarding how far they went. It ended as I said it did I have both confirmation from her from him as well as the fact that her storylines up until a few minutes before I showed up at his house because I felt something was off that night. And as I pulled into his driveway (which wraps around his and several other houses and let's out onto a side street) and drove around behind his house I saw her car pulling out onto said Street. There was only 3 to 4 minutes unaccounted for. Plenty of time for what did happen but not enough for what people believe happened. As they both texted me around the time she left. I'm sure I forgotten something again but if I think of it all edit a third time. Edit: Thank you for responding, everyone. We've been talking back and forth all day and while I've been constant on wanting to make things whole again she has even back and forth about if she thinks it's even worth fixing because she doesnt know how. I'm not sure what to tell her. What would be the first steps? I'm not sure where to even begin, as the weight of it all is finally hitting me. My girlfriend and I have been dating since March of 2016. We hit it off and things were amazing for the first year or so. Little things popped up afterwards when we moved and she began to get homesick, she moved 2 hours from where she's lived her whole life a little over 4 months before she and I got together, and things started going south. After some rough patches, finding out she wanted to move back home through messages to her friends (without specifying she wanted me to come with her) we talked about her happiness and she said she wasn't as happy as she wanted to be, living where we live now and expressed some concerns she had with my part in the relationship. I've since worked on those issues, I spend more time with her, less with games and help out around the house more than I used to. I've always been bad with dishes and laundry but am now usually the one taking care of them (we do laundry together) while she cooks most often. The other night we had made a pot roast and she took some to a friends house because his fridge had broken overnight and they lost all the food they had in it. I was worried something was going on because of some behavioral things I'd picked up on the previous nights when we had all 3 been at the gym together. I asked her what was taking so long for her to get home (he lives only 5 minutes away and it had been almost an hour. She told me she stopped to get gas, talked with her crazy friend on the phone for a bit (who called her because she didn't respond to a Snapchat message fast enough) and had to wait for him as he was in the bathroom when she arrived. I've had trust issues in the past, both in previous relationships and with her because of her lying about wanting to move away and being happy with me. I asked her about it and expressed my concerns. She showed me a receipt for gas as well as her call log showing that her friend did in fact call her during the time she was gone. I let it go, blaming my own paranoia and fear and we went to bed. This morning ( these events happened this past Sunday evening) I went through her phone (I know, it's bad, don't do it, you're breaking her trust, etc. etc.) before I could stop myself and I saw messages saved between her and this guy. I'll skip the details of the messages, needless to say I confronted her and she admitted to making out with him and to him having his hand down her pants. She cried, I cried a while after and am unsure if I've stopped since. She's at work as I write this. I've since asked her if she would have told me if I didn't find out, and she said probably not. She followed up by saying she didn't know when I asked if she would have let this happen again and get further. She's said that she wants to make things right but doesn't know how, that her unhappiness has made her into something she's not. But she doesn't really know why she's unhappy (beyond not living back in her hometown with her friends). I'm at a loss myself as to what to do. I love her, even after this, whether that's a mistake or not remains to be seen. I want to move past this and forgive her but I know it won't be easy, for either of us. She has said the same to me, that she still loves me, doesn't know why she did it and wants to try and fix things. What should we do? What are the most successful options? And what can I do to ease this pain.. Any help or advice would be appreciated. tldr: girlfriend cheated, expressed remorse and we still love each other but the trust is gone. How can we bring it back and make things between us better again?",
101,"After a year of a DB, found out my wife saw another man in the weekend.Occasional lurker, first time poster. Throw away account for obvious reasons. Me and my wife have been married for just shy of two years. Prior to that, we had been together for about three. The last 8 months we have had sex twice, and any attempts to make the first move has always been met with rejection. Y'know, just your classic tale of DBs. Anyway, last night I found out she had visited a man she works with the day prior, and lied to me about it. A bit of backstory (cue Scooby Doo timewarp SFX); When we were still dating, we moved in together. However, this didn't last long as I found out she had been sleeping with a guy from her work. Naturally, we broke up. Long story short, a number of months later, we worked through it and started dating again. Trust from her was built gradually and I regained that sense of ease in your heart that comes with it. Flash forward a few years, we got married. Things were great. But as anyone who's ever been cheated on before knows, there's always that small voice in your head telling you to be on the look out. Apologies for the long post, but I'll try to cut out as much junk as I can. Around the time our sex life started to wane (probably not long after we got married if I'm being honest), I did what any man probably does - tried to figure out what the problem was. Unfortunately, it got to the point where I just gave up trying to initiate. You can only take polite rejection so many times. I became withdrawn from her. I began to resent her. I was unhappy. I couldn't look at her naked anymore because doing so was heartbreaking. Here was my beautiful wife...whom for all I knew, didn't want me - her husband. I wanted intimacy. I started to forget what she looked like naked. I tried to bring it up with her, but it was never the right time - or a good time. She was too tired. She was too busy. She was out with friends. It was always something. On Saturday, she tells me she's going to visit a girl friend to do some shopping. Cool. Okay. No biggie. She leaves, taking the car, and is gone about two hours. Now in hindsight, I guess I started seeing familiar signs before she left. She was acting very close to me. Wanting long hugs. The tone of her voice was just ever so slightly off. The little things that make your brain just go ""Hmm"" (cue C&C Music Factory). But at the time, I didn't take too much notice. I mean why would i? She's gone about two hours and returns. She tells me about her trip. Later on that afternoon, I head into town, taking the same car. As I pull into a park, I notice a receipt sitting on the passenger's side. Which isn't surprising, as I tossed it there a couple of days ago. But what did catch my eye was the fact that it A: hadn't been moved for her friend to sit there, and B: wasn't crumpled from someone sitting on it. Again, my brain goes ""hmm"". But no biggie. The following day, while she's sleeping, I decide to check the dashcam. Just to be... certain. Sounds paranoid I know, but my instinct was just tapping me on the shoulder and I had to listen to it. I see the video from her leaving our garage. The car travels to the end of the driveway, then bam - the video shuts off. A small movement as though the cable was pulled from it. It resumes when shes back in our town, at the supermarket. Right now alarm bells are going off. I did something pretty sneaky next, but I had to know. I opened up her laptop, and looked at her Google map history. Sure enough, she didn't go anywhere near where she said she was. In fact, I recognize the location. It was a work colleague of hers (whom I've give a ride in the past - hence why I know the location). I confront her with this information. She initially tries to lie about it, but her face is pale white. Eventually she can't dispute the facts she's presented with (and I keep telling her to stop lying to me). She tells me how this guy at work has developed feelings for her. That she went over there to 'talk'. How he was becoming 'inappropriate over the course of their friendship. Of course, I didn't believe a word of this. Why would I? The more questions I asked, the more she would clarify things. To cut it short, I'm about 75% certain she's telling me the truth when she says nothing happened. Just from piecing things together and the timeline of events. However, I'm relatively sure this is the first time it's happened (if you ignore past events), but I'm unsure of whether or not I happened to catch this just before things *were* to happen down the line. However, it doesn't change the fact she lied to me and tried to deceive me. Again. We talked until the very early hours. To bring it around to the topic at hand - DBs - I mentioned my feelings towards this. She knew it was an issue. She told me how she has lost that 'urge' in herself and doesn't know how to get it back. The sensation for intimacy just isn't there for her, she said. I told her that's fine. That it would be something you normally work out with someone in a marriage with the goal being to get passed it and move on. However, considering what she has now done (again), I looked at her and said, ""But now - now you have turned a barrier into a wall."" TLDR; DB for over a year. Caught wife visiting another man she works with. Again.",
102,"My ex-wife’s friends tell her how happy she looks with her new bf, but they have no idea that she cheated on me.I want so badly to tell her friends how horrible she was to me. I won’t do that, but I’ve got to tell someone. I need people to know that she is not who they think she is. Seeing her friends (some of whom had also become my friends) comment on how happy she looks in pictures of her and her new boyfriend has wrecked me. That alone has been harder to deal with than the actual divorce. I don’t think they would be saying that if they knew she had cheated on me with an ex-boyfriend. I wonder what they would think if they knew she was emotionally manipulative and abusive. Anything they’ve been told about the divorce has probably been an outright lie, or at best, a misrepresentation of what really happened. It’s also taking an enormous amount of will power to not reach out to her new bf and warn him that she is a narcissist who comes from a family of emotionally controlling people. So, instead, I just sit here, an emotional wreck who cringes at the thought of dating again even though it has been over a year. My ex, on the other hand, was plastering a new relationship all over Facebook within a few months.",
103,"My girlfriend cheated on meI am so angry, disappointed, upset and frustrated all in one. Just feel like throwing my TV out of the window and then myself with it. I caught her about 6 weeks ago messaging a guy from her work talking about wanting to do sexual things with him and I saw a load of pictures she had taken of herself naked/in her underwear on her phone but couldn’t find any evidence she had sent it (even though I knew for sure she did). Obviously she denied this. She said that she never did anything with him and it was wrong but harmless. I was furious but I wanted to believe her. I told her if I ever found anything like this again I wouldn’t even give her another chance. Anyway I noticed she changed her password on her phone so alarm bells were going off and she was acting weird. She fell asleep tonight with her phone turned on so I took it and had a browse. All of her messages on WhatsApp etc are all deleted, even between her and her friends. Had a look in her pictures and saw more nudes/underwear shots again but this time I saw a picture of someone’s dick in between the nudes and a load of screen shotted messages with that guy saying how she wanted him to fuck her and how she wanted his dick in her mouth. All of this stuff is dated a couple of weeks ago. I confronted her about it and kicked her out. I’m so angry and betrayed right now. I know more has gone on but she will never admit it Edit: We were together for 5 years",

I will continue to fight the uphill battle of nofap.,
105,"My [24M] girlfriend [24F] cheated on meThrowaway for obvious reasons. My girlfriend and I have been together for over a year and moved in with each other back in June 2019. The beginning of the relationship was amazing (honeymoon phase) but over the past 2 or so months, things have kind of taken a turn for the worst. It didn't feel like we were really dating but more like roommates with each other. We had tried having conversations about it but things didn't really change. Cue this past weekend she was with some friends while I stayed home to hang out with a few of my friends. She comes back from the trip on Saturday and things definitely felt more off than they used to. She felt even more distant and came to me crying and wanting to talk. We probably had one of the best conversations about our relationship that day with us understanding each other's points of view and where the both of us could put in some work to moving forward with the relationship. She did bring up she had shared a bed with one of her male friends but in a platonic way. After that conversations things were by no mean fixed or in happy land and she went to stay the night with her friend. Yesterday she confronts me and tells me she has something to tell me. While on her trip she made out and blew one of her friends but never told me that when we had our conversation Saturday night. She only told me a partial truth of sleeping in the same bed as him. I love her and all Saturday night and during the day Sunday I felt like shit and hoped her and I could move forward with our relationship, but with this new information, I'm no longer sure. She's back to staying with her friend as I told her to figure out what she wants because it doesn't look like she wants me if she's willing to cheat. My question for this sub is how/if am I supposed to forgive her? This is one of her friends from her main circle. How am I supposed to show my face to her friends or her family? Is there any way that trust can be rebuilt? Edit: I want to add that she said they were both drunk. I know that should not change things but I would like to be transparent on the details and not leave anything out.",

It’s been a month and I already found another guy and we are in a relationship. My ex I guess stalked my social media and messaged my boyfriend threatening him to stay away from his girl and said all the sexual stuff we did together. He told me that guys are very possessive and he wants to still be in my life. That I need him to make me happy. He called me one day when I posted that I was with my new boyfriend. He called non stop and said it was an emergency. I ignored him and he showed up to my house. I am under the process of getting a restraining order. He acted like he didn’t care our whole relationship yet now he’s acting like this. How should I handle him? Why is he doing this now if he cheated the whole time?",

113,"GF(30) cheated on me(30M) and is pregnantIn order for this story to make sense, I'm going to have to give you a little background. My girlfriend and I have been together for years. She works in PR, but her last job, though the pay was pretty good, had no room for growth. She was there for probably 4 1/2-5 years and she quit a little over a year ago because our son was due in mid December and she thought it would give her the perfect amount of time to bond with him and find the ""perfect"" job. After about three months, I noticed she's not really happy staying at home and interviews she has gone on for higher level jobs (executive, etc) aren't really going well. So I encourage her to take apply for a job at a place relatively close to our house, making a lot less money, but a ton of growth potential. She reluctantly agrees and gets offered the job on the spot. She comes home and tells me she still isn't sure this is the right place for her and she thinks it's a step back. Again, I encourage her until she finally takes the job. She ends up loving the job. She made new work friends right away and over time, they became real friends. One of them is a 24 year old named Steve (not his real name). They'd call and text each other a lot (same with several of her other work friends), they had a work group chat, would hang out some weekend nights for dinner and drinks (all her co workers who were friends). About four months ago, she starts getting really distant and weird. I tried to talk to her about it, but she tells me it's just work and she has a lot on her plate. We had sex with each other once in the last five months. I try to support her, but it ends up backfiring in my face and causing arguments about petty stupid stuff. Our son's first birthday was right before Christmas. We celebrated it the Sunday after. She again is weird, moody and distant. She ruined his birthday. All our friends and family were there. She ends up leaving telling me I'm hounding her and she needs air. I don't know what to do at this point. I let her go. I tried calling and texting her for hours. Nothing. Her parents and siblings. Same thing. No one can get a hold of her. Finally at around 11 pm (this all happened around 3-4ish in the afternoon) she comes home and tells me it's just not working out anymore. I'm dumbfounded and start asking questions. She again tells me it's all my fault and I'm making her crazy and this just isn't working and she's going to her parents for a while. So she leaves. I let her go figuring she needs time to cool off. I'm able to figure out from talking to her mom, she's not really there. The next day I call and text her many times throughout the day and hear nothing. At this point, in my mind I think something is going on, but I don't think it's cheating. I think she's either in danger or having a break down. About a week passes with every little interaction from her, just to drop the baby off with her mom so she can see him because she doesn't want to see me. I tell her parents I'm worried about her and think something is going on and they agree. I'm assuming she told them before telling me, but long story short after about two weeks of this crazy stuff going on, she agrees to meet me at a coffee shop. I immediately ask her if she's ok and if she needs help. She proceeds to tell me, she's been sleeping with Steve for months and she's pregnant. I was in complete shock, walked out, and cried in my car. It's been several weeks and I still feeling completely devastated by this and I think she's living with him. I'm trying to co parent with her, but I hate her. I don't want our son in his apartment. I know I need to contact a lawyer, but this is all so new to me. Anyone have advice? I'm hoping this is clear. I'm crying as I write this, but it also feels good to get everything off my chest. So if you have any follow up questions, I'll answer to the best of my ability. Also, sorry this is so long. **TL;DR: Girlfriend cheated on me and is pregnant by her co-worker. I don't know what to do next. We have a one year old.** &#x200B; Edit: I'm overwhelmed with support. Thank you for the tips and love. It means a lot to me and is making this bad situation a tiny bit better.",
114,"*UPDATE My(51M) ex-wife(50F) who cheated on me and lied to destroy me in divorce just died of cancer, and my 2 girls are upset with me because I refused to sit in the family and friends section during the funeral with my ex-wife's family who hid her infidelity and helped her lie against me in courtHello. Earlier this week I posted, but my thread was eventually deleted because I broke the rules for my name for this sub so I had to make a new account with the ThrowRA prefix. Below I have included the entire text from my previous post as a recap. I apologize to the Mods for not reading the rules thoroughly before posting. As far as an update, I received very good advice from many people here to wait at least a few weeks, and possibly even a few months before I explain to my girls why I had so much difficulty sitting with their mothers family at her funeral. Looking back at it, this is the obvious course of action, but when my girls confronted me about it, a flood of emotions came back and sort of short circuited my thinking a bit. I basically sat down with them this weekend and told them ultimately I may have been wrong, but I have very good reasons for why I felt that way and that after things have calmed down and everyone is done mourning their mother, we'll have a good long talk why I felt the way I did. They understood and there was no further drama after that. It may be a while but many people asked me to update them after I explain everything to my daughters, and I will. But it may be a couple of months. Thank you for your support and help. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \*\*Previous thread > 15 years ago, my wife completely betrayed me and began an affair with a childhood friend of mine. When I found out and confronted her, I came to realize she had been preparing to divorce me for a very long time. She had all her ducks in a row and completely railroaded me. After I confronted her, she left to stay with her family. During that time she withdrew all the money from our joint accounts and took all the emergency cash and valuables we had in the home safe. While I was spending the week trying to negotiate with her to go to a marriage counselor, she was leading me on while simultaneously hiring a lawyer and filing for divorce. > >I was shortly served papers and removed from the family home. She had claimed domestic abuse not only against her but against my 2 daughters as well. This was a complete lie. The police only allowed me to take my personal papers, a bag full of clothes, and my car. > >I was completely decimated in the divorce. I lost a portion of my retirement, she got the house and all our assets other than my car, motorcycle and my personal effects that were still at the house. On top of this I had to pay spousal support for 10 years and child support until the girls were 18. I lost custody of the girls and was given supervised visitation for a year and then after that I was only able to get them one weekend a month, and then for a couple of weeks in the summer, and no holidays. And she only agreed to let me see the girls in this capacity if I agreed to everything else above. > >I spent 2 dark years living in my parents basement trying to recover both financially and mentally. Had it not been for the support of my family and friends I might have ended it. It took another 5 years to save enough money to get out of the efficiency apartment I was living in and into a small town home. My relationships with women were damaged for years after this, as I had severe trust issues and would never commit to anyone. It has only been recently that I have been able to work past these issues and give my most recent girlfriend the trust and love she deserves. No body is perfect. I wasn't the perfect husband. But I was loyal, kind, and worked hard to provide for my family. I in no way deserved to be destroyed like this. > >During the divorce her family had lied on her behalf claiming they had seen me fly off into rages, which was complete bullshit. I also found out in the following years they knew she was cheating with my friend for at least a year before the divorce. They, especially her mother hid all this from me, and helped to destroy my reputation. I lost almost all my longtime friends because of the lies they spread. > >Fast forward 15 years and my ex-wife has died of pancreatic cancer. Out of respect for my 2 girls I attended the funeral, but I could not bring myself to sit up front in the family and friends section. I would have had to sit among people who had betrayed me and destroyed my life and my family and who never apologized or tried to make amends. I quietly sat in the very back near the door, and when the time came I passed the coffin, said goodbye, and forgave her. Now my girls are upset with me that I refused to sit with them with the rest of the family. They are claiming I was being petty. My girls do no know the extent to which their mother and grandparents harmed me. I swallowed all of it to protect them and their childhoods. > >But now I feel I have the right to defend my honor and position. My girls are adults now with their own families, and are mature enough to understand I should hope. I need advice on how to approach the subject with them both in such a way that I can explain myself without hurting them. I still have all the evidence and access to witnesses that prove their mother and her family were cheating on me and was viciously planning on wrecking my life. The friend of mine who my ex-wife was cheating with even came to me begging for forgiveness many years later. I don't want my girls to live the rest of their lives hating their mothers memory or their grandparents, but I also don't deserve to continue to be questioned and criticized when I am so standoffish when it comes to what happened to me in my past.",

116,"GF [24F] cheated on me [25M] with a friend [30M] whilst we were on holiday and saw him afterwards behind my back. What do I do?**EDIT:** Please read the update at the bottom of this post before telling me to leave her. I have, as of yesterday evening. Hi folks, I'll try not to ramble too much but hard to figure out what to do right now. Please take the time to read the whole thing. I really need some advice and I don't know who I can actually speak to. Started writing this on Sunday after this started to unravel. I'd always told myself that I would never give a cheat a second chance but its a lot easier said than done. On Sunday my girlfriend of almost 4 years admitted to sleeping with a friend of ours whilst a dozen of us were on a group holiday. He wasn't a close friend at all, in fact it was only the second time we met him (first time was on another holiday two years ago through the same friendship group) GF and I had a good relationship I think. I'm quite a tactile and affectionate person, GF isn't so much as she has low self-esteem issues and doesn't often feel confident expressing herself like that. She is confident and outgoing with friends she just doesn't see what people see in her. The holiday was around three weeks ago. She'd been quite quiet and mopey over the last few weeks and we hadn't had sex at all. I'd kind of chalked it up to January blues and switching contraceptive pill. On Sunday we had sex for the first time in a month but I could tell she wasn't happy afterwards. I confronted her and asked her what was wrong. After a bit of coercing, she initially said that she kissed this guy whilst on our holiday. When I asked her if that's all they did, she said no and admitted to sleeping with him. She also confessed to kissing him again the following night. I was in shock and didn't really know how to react or feel. For the rest of the evening, GF was very honest with anything I asked her, which I appreciated. The evening in question that started it, she had been very drunk. I don't use that as an excuse and neither does she. We're firm believers that whilst drink reduces inhibition, you're still in control of the choices you make. We'd got back from a night out and as we were walking up to our Airbnb as a group, he kissed her. Apparently it was fairly brief and no one saw. We all went up the flat and carried on partying for a bit. At some point they went and had sex in one of the bathrooms. It wasn't immediately after getting into the flat. I don't know who initiated that, I didn't ask. This is extremely hurtful, but in some ways the following evening was more hurtful. I'd picked up some very flirty vibes from him towards her over the previous couple of days. He's single, good lucking and in your face. My GF is very attractive and doesn't realise it, so I'm used to guys flirting with her. But he was sitting next to her whenever we went to a bar etc. I quietly spoke to her on the following night out (far more sober), saying that I was picking up strong vibes from him and that she should maybe put some distance between them. I felt guilty even saying it, I'm not a jealous guy but I knew he was interested (didn't know it was too late at this point though). She said OK, and didn't admit anything at this point, not even picking up on the vibe herself His best friend [30F] who we'd never met before had been quite flirty with me at the beginning of the trip (she didn't realise I was in a relationship initially) and my GF then spoke to me about this and I agreed that I picked up that vibe from her. I'd been feeling guilty over the previous couple of days for being flattered by the attention as the female friend was also very attractive and my own self-esteem isn't that great. Anyway, later that evening we all wanted to find a takeaway and the group (about 12 of us) split up a bit to look for somewhere. I was drunker at that point and hadn't realised that GF had gone off with him, but wouldn't have been too concerned even if i had realised now that I'd spoken to her about it. Whilst they were away from the rest of the group, they kissed again down a side street. That really pisses me off. To go and do that when she was far more sober and I'd already voiced my concerns was a slap in the face. GF admitted she hadn't decided before Sunday whether to tell me or not, wondering if she could just move on if she kept it a secret (context will follow) but couldn't lie to me when I put her on the spot by asking what was wrong. She's said that she didn't do it because anything was lacking from our relationship (she described me as perfect and the best thing to ever happen to her), it was just selfishness that arose from feeling validated from his attentions when she doesn't see herself as being desirable. I'm not sure that our relationship not being the cause actually makes me feel better. If there was an issue between us, at least there's something there to work on and resolve. I'm also not sure I believe her anyway. She has a bit of a fucked up history and I'm not sure she quite realised it until we spoke this evening about why this happened. She doesn't use any of them as excuses, for which I'm grateful. I told her that whether we try to make this work or not, she needs counselling/therapy. I think collectively those issues have damaged her more than she realised and may well have contributed to her deciding to fuck things up so much. However, the following morning I pushed for more details about what contact they've had since then. She admitted that they had been sexting, trading nudes (she's not sent me a nude in years as she's quite self-conscious) and that they'd been getting to know each other, which starts to sound more like emotional cheating too. She also confessed that the weekend after NYE, she spent the night with him in his home city under the pretense of seeing an old school friend. She couldn't even promise to cut him off whilst we work this out. The idea that if I hadn't put her on the spot she might not have told me so that she could ""figure it out for herself"" in her words but would most likely have kept seeing him makes me feel physically sick. In a month we were due to go on a night out in another city with a group of friends including this guy. It would have been her birthday on that weekend. Again, the idea that we would have taken a train with him up to a night out and she most likely would have tried to find an opportunity to hook up with him again behind my back makes me feel sick, humiliated and angry. I love her and I did believe that she was truly sorry and loves me too, until she couldn't commit to cutting him off. When I got upset that really pushed her over the edge. In her own words, she's a person who likes to plan and be in control but she never thought out the consequences in this situation and never meant to hurt me. I don't have any close friends and the vast majority of my friends are all part of this same social circle. She asked me that if it doesn't work out, would we still be able to be friends and share the same group of friends who we all met through a uni club. I said I don't know, but I'm not giving them up when she chose to do this and I introduced her to them. I've spent the last two nights at my mum's. I'll be seeing her again this evening to talk. I don't know what she will say, but anything short of a heartfelt 100% dedication to making it work won't be enough, if I even choose to accept it. I don't think she'll be able to make that commitment. If I cant be with her, I want to make her realise how much pain she's caused and the consequences of her actions and that shit like this will prevent her ever having a stable long term relationship. I love her and I want her to be happy, despite my anger and sadness. **TL;DR** GF cheated on me and I then found out it continued into an 'affair' which I'm not convinced she ever would have told me about. I don't think she even realises the betrayal she's caused. Can we make this work and if not, how do I at least help her to be more mature and responsible in the future? **EDIT:** Thank you all for the very direct and blunt advice. When I posted this this morning, I was feeling sad and self pitying but was trying to tell myself that maybe we stood a chance. I realise now that there is no chance of reconciliation after her refusal to stop contacting him. I will be seeing her this evening and finishing this. It will be difficult as our flat is rented in both our names until june/July and neither can afford it without the other really, but I'll figure that out. If anyone else has any more advice or suggestions, please keep them coming. **UPDATE:** So I have broken up with her. We have a lot to sort out because of our shared flat, but I'm glad that it's been said. Now I can try and begin the healing process",
117,"Girlfriend cheated on me and is pregnantIn order for this story to make sense, I'm going to have to give you a little background. My girlfriend and I have been together for years. We're both 30. She works in PR, but her last job, though the pay was pretty good, had no room for growth. She was there for probably 4 1/2-5 years and she quit a little over a year ago because our son was due in mid December and she thought it would give her the perfect amount of time to bond with him and find the ""perfect"" job. After about three months, I noticed she's not really happy staying at home and interviews she has gone on for higher level jobs aren't really going well. So I encourage her to apply for a job at a place relatively close to our house, making a lot less money, but a ton of growth potential. She reluctantly agrees and gets offered the job on the spot. She comes home and tells me she still isn't sure this is the right place for her and she thinks it's a step back. Again, I encourage her until she finally takes the job. She ends up loving the job. She made new work friends right away and over time, they became real friends. One of them is a 24 year old named Steve (not his real name). They'd call and text each other a lot (same with several of her other work friends), they had a work group chat, would hang out some weekend nights for dinner and drinks (all her co workers who were friends). About four months ago, she starts getting really distant and weird. I tried to talk to her about it, but she tells me it's just work and she has a lot on her plate. We had sex with each other once in the last five months. I try to support her, but it ends up backfiring in my face and causing arguments about petty stupid stuff. Our son's first birthday was right before Christmas. We celebrated it the Sunday after. She again is weird, moody and distant. She ruined his birthday. All our friends and family were there. She ends up leaving telling me I'm hounding her and she needs air. I don't know what to do at this point. I let her go. I tried calling and texting her for hours. Nothing. Her parents and siblings. Same thing. No one can get a hold of her. Finally at around 11 pm (this all happened around 3-4ish in the afternoon) she comes home and tells me it's just not working out anymore. I'm dumbfounded and start asking questions. She again tells me it's all my fault and I'm making her crazy and this just isn't working and she's going to her parents for a while. So she leaves. I let her go figuring she needs time to cool off. I'm able to figure out from talking to her mom, she's not really there. The next day I call and text her many times throughout the day and hear nothing. At this point, in my mind I think something is going on, but I don't think it's cheating. I think she's either in danger or having a break down. About a week passes with every little interaction from her, just to drop the baby off with her mom so she can see him because she doesn't want to see me. I tell her parents I'm worried about her and think something is going on and they agree. I'm assuming she told them before telling me, but long story short after about two weeks of this crazy stuff going on, she agrees to meet me at a coffee shop. I immediately ask her if she's ok and if she needs help. She proceeds to tell me, she's been sleeping with Steve for months and she's pregnant. I was in complete shock, walked out, and cried in my car. It's been several weeks and I still feeling completely devastated by this and I think she's living with him. I'm trying to co parent with her, but I hate her. I don't want our son in his apartment. I'm contacting several lawyers tomorrow to see where to go from here. Anyone have advice? I don't know how to move on from this. I thought she was the one. &#x200B; Posted this in relationships and was told by a few people in the DMs and thread this might be a better place for support.",
118,"Wife cheated on me with her guy friendSo my job and some of my hobbies require me to travel, 6-7 weekends a year. This past weekend i was gone for work, came home and something was off. Sex died immediately after we got married, anyways opening her phone to turn on the google lights, i see a list, of her sexual partners. Which are more partners than shes told me, ok ok, whatever not concerned. So i check out her safari history, adultery shows up, going back to the “list” one guy shes adamantly told me shes never slept with. So i check out his text message to my wife. At 12:05 AM he sends her an address, im not dumb here. My hearts coming out of my chest Ok ok, i put the phone down. I wake up my wife and tell her i had a horrible dream she cheated on me. She doesn’t answer at first but 15 minutes later reassures me, shes never cheated. She falls back asleep, i check her google maps, theres the address. Check the text messages, she deleted it and the list. I feel awful going through my wifes phone but im here now, im hurt, what do I do.",
119,"I did it!! I got over my 8-year girlfriend after she cheated on me!! I feel amazing!This sub was such a safe haven for me over this period of time, but I can finally say that the pain is gone. ITS OVER. I am overcome with thankfulness. I never thought I’d be okay. But the last bit of feelings seem to have finally sorted themselves out. Note: I was not able to do this while still holding my positive regard for my ex. She treated me pretty poorly, and facing this helped me work through my breakup and process my feelings. I don’t personally think exes should be friends if the relationship was intense and strong at one point. That’s just me, though. And, guys, this took me NINE months. Like almost an entire year to let this go. So bear that in mind when you’re feeling hopeless.",
120,"My husband cheated on me with a friend of mineI really don’t have anything else to say. I am dealing with a million emotions and now I have to go to work and pretend I’m ok. I know I have to end this relationship, I’m really sick about it. I haven’t reached the point of heartbreak yet and that scares me; I still don’t believe it. Waiting for him to tell me the truth felt like I was bracing being shot in the chest. Now that I know I’m numb. EDIT: Thank you everyone for your encouraging words you guys helped me get thru this work day. I’m off work now and being home is honestly the hardest part. I’m going to curl in a ball and possibly eat a whole pizza pie and tomorrow I plan on removing everything that is his or remotely represents “us”.

122,"Gf(21F) cheated on me(21M) and still thinks it's okay to text the man with who she cheated on me withThis happened a few weeks ago after finding out from one of her close friends, that she went on a date with one her guy friends she admitted to have a crush on in the beginning of our relationship. She regularly texted that guy and flirted sexually. And when asked about that she just shut me down by saying it's what she does with all of her guy friends. Few days later she said that she kissed that guy but that didn't mean anything to her and she loved me. I don't know what to take of it ( felt shattered and numb) . She literally begged me to not leave her for just a mistake on her part. I knew I can't trust her anymore but, told her never to text that guy ever. A day ago I found her texting that guy again. I just can't think of anything to do. I just wanted to know how to break things up in the worst way possible . Edit: Thank You everyone for those amazing advices ... Just wanted you all to know that I just took the high road and sent her a text attaching all the proofs that I had, saying it's done. After that I blocked her from every social media and phone. She came over to the place I stayed and literally begged me falling to my feet.. but I couldn't embarass myself anymore, so I just told her to leave and shut the door. Thought I had to share this with you all.",
123,"Wife cheated on me, is threatening me, I feel lost.I caught my wife lying about being somewhere when she was actually at a hotel.

124,"Just found out that my wife and mother of my 2 children cheated on me.I found a wayward text on her phone, and I put all of the pieces together. She’s been acting weird since last summer, and now I know why. Making up “excuses” to be gone after 7-8 PM: Needing to return a library book, needed to go grocery shopping and take 2 hours, being at the gym from 8 PM to 11 PM (no one works out for that long!), going over her “parent’s house”, etc. There’s probably more that I’m forgetting. It wasn’t just at night either. Anyways, she actually admitted some things to me. She had sex with someone that I don’t know named “R”. Don’t know his full name. Claims it happened “once”. Ha, sure. I have no idea who this person could be. She’s never dated anyone whose name starts with an R that I’m aware of. It’s driving me crazy, but I guess it doesn’t matter at the end. Her reasonings were brutal: •Not enough sex, affection and “intimacy” from me. I’m not a touchy feely person, so she cheats. •Bored with her life, marriage and motherhood. Don’t get that one? At all? She has an amazing life! •I don’t make her finish ever, apparently. I don’t listen to her when she tells me what she wants in bed. •Bad sex life. Makes me feel terrific. I don’t know. Not enough reasons to cheat, IMO. I WOULD NEVER CHEAT ON HER. I’ve never even thought about it, except maybe a random time with a coworker (nothing happened, even though it could have). This was just a vent, so I’m rambling. Not sure if I can move past this, but we have 2 young kids together.",
125,"GF [33F] cheated on me [33M] after 9+ years, because I was unable to show love or affection. In need for advice. I've been living together with my girlfriend for almost 6 years now. We've been together for over 9 years and have been through some difficult times and stuff in our lives together. We're both 33. At the beginning, I was the one working while she finished her last two semesters of studies. After that, we both worked and lived a pretty happy relationship together.Ever since childhood, however, I have been unable to express and show my love. Unfortunately - also towards her. I would not be able to return the love she sent out toward me. I neglected her, although I felt I was a prisoner in my own mind. One side of me could see her suffering for not returning the love she sent out to me, and the other side was trying to protect myself from being hurt again, as I had been hurt in the past. (Although, as I've mentioned, we lived a very healthy relationship for about 3-4 years or so.) Marriage was always something which I knew she wanted, but my point of view in regard to marriages hasn't been the best (Went through a divorce as a kid, when my mum left her second husband and ever since felt that it was something I needed to stay away from). Apparently I ignored her over such a long period of time, that I neglected her completely. Only did, what was good for me and not necessarily for us. I always felt love for her, but could never show or express it. About two months ago, she confessed to me, that she has been cheating on me with somebody. I told her, that we could work it out. Even went on vacation together for 5 days and had one of the most harmonic vacations in a long time - wonderful sex every day and evening - it was great. Problem is, I've been studying for 1.5 years and we agreed that she support me through my studies. So now I'm seeing myself in this situation, where I have to live with her in the same flat, and have to see her go every weekend, so she can stay with the other guy. I cook for us every second day and keep the house clean, go grocery shopping and all that. I've been working on myself as a person over the last weeks and realize, that it's a process, that will take more time but I also don't want to lose her. Yesterday she told me, that in the end her reason will win in the end, and that she will return eventually. She always expresses more attraction towards me, whenever I signal her, that I'm over her and show her the cold shoulder... I don't have the finances for moving out - I can barely support myself while living together with her. Will NC help me in this situation? What shall I do? I'm absolutely clueless... TL; DR: Me \[33M\] been in a relationship with my gf \[33F\] for 9+ years. She cheated on me, because she was looking for love, caring and affection, I couldn't express or show. I don't want to give up on it all, what should I do?",
126,"My girlfriend cheated on me two days before we became “official”Just found this out today, a few hours ago. Totally heartbroken and don’t really know what to think. Basically I decided to date a girl I’ve known and had a crush on for the past decade. We grew up and we were super close. Our family’s were close as well. Last year we decided to date and we broke up due to wrong timing for the both of us. This year we decided to try again. I have been very good at protecting my energy and really careful on who I catch feelings for. And she’s a girl that I genuinely loved and cared about. Still do. But with her I felt a connection that I haven’t had with no one else ever in my life, probably due to all the history her and I have. So I decided to follow my heart and chase her. We had been talking for months before we made things official. We were basically in a relationship without the title. She said she was committed and so was I, things were perfect. On New Years she came over to my apartment and spent the night with me, we had sex and decided it was time to make things official and put that title on it. But today she told me she slept with someone else two days before we did that. The dude that she slept with is an ex type figure, but not really. He was just a fuckboy that viewed her as a sex object, and she even knew that. But she has an “emotional attachment” towards him. I was aware of him the entire time her and I were talking and she told me they don’t talk and she’s focused on me. A week before they slept together, I even mentioned something about it bothering me she still has him added as a friend on Snapchat, and she said she’ll remove him. But she didn’t. It was a lie. She told me she asked all her friends if she’s a shitty person for sleeping with someone else when her and I had a thing going on. They said no because technically she was “single” when she did it. Which yes we were technically single but at the same time, we weren’t. She wanted me to stay loyal to her and to act as if we were in a relationship and she’d do the same. Like I said we were basically in a relationship without the title. Should I drop her off completely or get over it and still be with her because yes, she did it when we were still “single” Thank you for taking the time to read this and responding. I just feel like I need to vent cause the pain in my heart won’t end",
127,"My First Serious GF cheated on me in her first DAY of collegeSo this is the story of my first GF which happened to be in high school. We met my freshman year while she was a senior and I was a freshman. We eventually started having sex and our relationship became somewhat fueled on sex. (Pretty sure she was a nympho) Anyways, throughout our entire relationship she may or may not have slept/sent nudes to guys, to this day I don't know if she did or not tbh. So basically the relationship was toxic and we got to the point where she was going to college. I wanted to break it off because I knew she would cheat but I ended up not doing it because she convinced me that shed stay faithful and loyal. And being a dumbass 15 year old I believed her. Anyways I went to help her move in and she seemed okay, a little sad that we wouldn't be able to see each other anymore (keep in mind we had spent the whole summer together like all day everyday). I got back home and we FaceTimed she again seemed fine, I told her that I loved her and that id see her in the morning. &#x200B; The cheating: I woke up in the middle of the night to a snap from her I opened it up and it just said ""Im so sorry"" me being confused I immediately factetimed her. My calls didn't go through. I tried again and like on the fifth time she picked up. She picked up and I heard loud music and another guys voice. She tried to play it off and I, now at this point crying, asked her if she had cheated on me and she said she had and then I heard the guys voice although it be muffled. She was obviously drunk or high but she hadn't hung up the call... pretty soon she was moaning loudly and saying shit like harder and cum in me. I was scarred and still have like PTSD from it. I later found out she had been past around and fucked in the ass by like an entire frat party from one of her friends. &#x200B; Now: Im 17 now and a junior in high school. I have a new GF, and all seems to be well. I still have ptsd from that night and I have to say that it changed me and desensitized me. I think overall it made it better. Im still confused though. on her motives. Why did she do it? Im not being egocentric but I was the best bf she had ever had. Im not ""small"" by any means and our sex was great.

129,"My mom took in my ex boyfriend that cheated on me and has been treating him like a son ever since.Backstory: My first puppy love was my high school ex. We dated before either one of us had a car so my mom would drive to pick him up and let him come over to hang out at our house. He would check my text messages every time we saw each other. It would make me mad but I wasn’t hiding anything so I brushed it off. One day I asked to see his phone while he was going through mine and it turns out he was cheating on me. We broke up and he wasn’t very nice afterwards. My mother stayed in contact with him. He began calling and texting my mom asking for advice and help. I told her it bothered me but she didn’t care. Eventually, she let him move into our house for some years, even when I began seeing someone new. At this point my ex had starting calling her “mom”. It made me sick to my stomach. My then boyfriend would be over all while my ex was living there. I referred to him as my God brother so that I wouldn’t have to explain the weird situation. He was always breaking things and the room he was in would stink. My ex had already moved on and had a child by this time. He confessed to my mom at some point that he thought me and him would end up together and that I would have been the one who had his child. My mom has been helping him financially for years and invites him to family holidays. I’m not sure if my entire family realizes he’s my ex when he comes to holidays or if they’ve forgotten how we know each other in the first place. My mom got married and now my step dad also treats my ex like a son. The only person who seems to understand my frustration is my new step sister. My step dad told my step sister I should just get over it even though I never got a chance to heal because he’s never left the picture. My step sister has heard how my ex talks about the money my mom and step dad have given him and she doesn’t like it. Not to mention, my ex tried hitting on my step sister and my step dad supposedly encouraged it (just to add to how weird all of this is). My mom has forced me to have my ex in my life and she acts as if he’s her son and I should be okay with it. I absolutely hate it. My ex has even “told” on me to my mom when I didn’t respond to his voicemail as if I’m required to and he apparently calls her more than I do. My mom has also told me she is irritated every time she talks to me and I wonder if she feels the same way when she talks to my ex, but I doubt she does. She has chosen him over respect for me and it hurts. We are not related and dated briefly in high school which ended due to him cheating on me. I haven’t looked at him in that way since and we really don’t get along, not even as friends. My mom just feels bad for him, but what about how I feel... Am I wrong for wanting their relationship to end? I know it won’t, but I don’t feel I’m in the wrong for wanting it to. I would never invite him to my own wedding or future family gatherings and I can see my mom getting upset about it. What do y’all think? Has anyone else gone through this? Should I just ignore it and continue not including him in my personal life or perhaps avoid certain family get togethers if he’s going to be there even if my mom gets upset about it? Side note: I’m in my 20’s (he’s older than me, maybe 30 I’m not sure) and if she hadn’t kept him around I would have 0 contact with him. The fact my step dad is now in on it too makes it even worse. Also, just want to point out one of my mother’s ex boyfriends tried contacting me to be part of an event he was putting together and I ignored his message out of respect for my mother (he cheated on her). Unfortunately she can’t say the same for me.",
130,"My first fuck after husband cheated on me. [F23] [MF]So long story short just before XMAS my husband had to tell me he got some girl pregnant he met on tinder. I won't go much into that but this story is about me fucking the first guy after my marrige fell apart. I work in a normal office environment, and worked my way up from entry level to being one of the assistants (6 of us total) to my boss who is a VP. We have always had a flirty relationship, I have always also been a flirty girl. He is probably mid 40s, in good shape, tall. My husband has met him at company parties and such and hated how flirty we were. The Monday before new years I had known about my hubby for more then a week. I had been a zombie in life, just making the motions but not really there. 2 of the other girls took me to lunch. During our lunch we had some wine and the girls told me I needed to go out and have fun. 3 glasses of wine later I returned to work slightly tipsy. When I got back I ran into my boss (M). I asked if he had time for me later in the day. M regularly works late, he stays till 8 or 9 most nights. So it's not unusual for me and him to be the last few people on the floor if I stay late. By 630 almost everyone was gone. I don't know if I had made up my mind of what I was going to do, but I certainly had an idea. Finally I approached his office and knocked on the door asking if he had a minute to talk. I was wearing a normal white blouse, nude color bra, a pencil skirt that went a little past my knees and a black thong. M obliged and I walked in and closed the door. With the door closed you can still see in part of the office through a window but it obscures most of it. When I closed the door M knew something was off. I asked if I could talk to him and asked if he wanted a drink (yes the bosses have small bars) he said sure and I poured both of us a scotch. Mine was really more like a double or triple, which I downed quickly almost in one shot. M ""shit, I know what you want"" Me ""I don't think you do"" M ""your putting in your notice, I will be sad to see you go you have really done well. I was hoping you would make a career here. Maybe finish college and move up"" While he said that I was drinking. Me ""I am not quitting"" M "" Really? The late night talk and the drinks. I just kinda assumed. You don't need that much liquid courage to ask for a raise. You have earned it I should have done it before the end of the year"" Me ""I am going to hold you to that next year but that's not it either"" M ""so why the talk what's up"" That's when I stood up from the chair and with my whole body shaking started to unbutton my blouse. Me ""Well maybe not a talk so much"" M ""oh what a going on is this a weird prank. Your married"" Me "" No I am not, he knocked up an Applebees waitress"" I took my blouse off and dropped it to the floor. M "" really? Still I am your boss, this isn't appropriate in the current climate. I really can't be doing such things with girls I work with."" I unzipped my skirt and let it drop to the floor also. I took my bra off and sat back down. I put one of my feet up on the corner of his desk. Me ""hmmm, You think i am going to sue or something. Okay then I guess you will just have to watch"" I started touching myself through my thong. Playing with my tits and rubbing my body. I touched myself more and more and was set instantly. M sat behind his desk just watching with his mouth half open. I pulled my thong to the side and rubbed my clit, and touched myself. I lightly licked some of my juices off my fingers. Me ""your really going to let me do this all alone."" I heard M unzip his suit pants. Behind his desk I could see he was obviously stroking his cock. I continued to touch myself. He watched while a gave a light moan out as I slipped a finger inside of myself. It wasn't long maybe 2 or 3 minutes when he called out to me. M ""come here"" I walked around his desk taking my thong off as I did. He turned his chair toward me and I saw his rock hard cock. It was much larger then by husband's. But I don't think it is actually that big. My husband while being very good looking was not well endowed. He was actually self conscious about it. M ""get on your knees"" I quickly keeled down and took his cock in my hands. I started stroking it while looking in his eyes. Then I put my head down and started sucking on him. With my free hand I continued to touch myself off and on. M moaned and growled a little. It was very sexy to have my boss in my mouth like this. I proceeded to give what I think is a very good blow job,lol. M ""I can't tell you how many times I have thought about this"" Me ""me too, I have made myself cum several times thinking of you"" M ""God your good at this, better then I expected from someone you age"" ""fuck your going to get me in trouble"" I kept at it for a little while longer. Twirling my tounge and taking care of his shaft. M ""fuck I am going to cum if you keep this up"" ""I want to taste you"" I stopped, stood up and hopped myself into his desk. I opened my legs and layed back a little as he got down from the chair and put his face between my legs. Oh god did he ever too. He was very talented, knowing exactly what to touch and where. Me ""fuck,fuck,fuck,fuck,fuck. Oh god, oh god, oh god, don't stop, don't stop"" lol. M slowly started working his fingers into it as well. Within no time he had two of them inside me, while still working my clit with his tounge. I came in no time like this. Shaking in pleasure and squeezing his head between my legs. M ""that was faster then I thought"" Me ""don't fucking stop"" M ""wow, never thought of you as so dominant"" Neither had I but I wanted more. M went back to work, fingering me faster and harder and burying his head in my soaking pussy. Before long I felt a finger of his gently probing my ass. Me ""mmmm hmmmm"" M ""Are you Sure?"" I laid back on his desk head hanging off the other side. I felt the pressure then the relief of his finger penetrating my ass. I let out a slight squeal, then another finger slid back in my pussy. Then his tounge back on my clit, I moaned so loudly I know if anyone was outside they heard me. Finally M stopped, stood up and started taking off his tie, then his shirt, finally his pants came off. Exposing a very good body for any man let alone one his age. I sat up on the desk watching him strip. Touching myself while he did it. M ""We are on so much trouble"" Me ""might as well enjoy it then, sit down"" M ""aren't I the boss?"" Me ""not right now"" M sat on his big office chair, naked with his cock rock hard. I got off the desk and moved my way on top of him in the chair. I was dripping wet, so it took little effort as I let his cock penetrate me. I let out a moan as I took him in inch by inch. He layed back as I started riding up and down. He grabbed my hips and ass for support but I bounced up and down on him for a few minutes while he played with my tits, kissed my body. He told me to get off finally and I hopped off. He flipped me around and bent me over the desk. Then he started fucking me from behind. He smacked my ass and pulled my hair. I loved every second of it. He fucked me harder and harder until I came again. Then he went right back to fucking me. It wasn't long before he flipped me over and had me on the desk again. Fucking me and touching my clit at the same time, my legs open farther then I thought they could go,lol. I came again screaming loudly. He fucked me like that for awhile longer. M ""fuck I am going to cum, where?"" Me ""I don't care babe"" M quickly pulled out of me, grabbing a leg and practically throwing me to the floor. I quickly took his cock in my mouth, but he pulled my hair yanking my head back. I looked up at him while he finished himself off. It took only a couple strokes and he started cumming. I opened my mouth for him but he obviously want to cum on my face. Did he ever,lol. He shot cum in my mouth, my face, my hair and some even landed on my tits. When he was done he sat back down. I stood up put most of my clothes back on and headed for the door. M asked where I was going to which I said the bathroom. I opened the door walked out onto our office area to notice I totally forgot the cleaning crew comes in about 7pm. 3 people looking back at me with grins from ear to ear. My face and hair covered in cum. Me ""fuck"" M ""forgot about the cleaning crew?"" Me ""yep"" M ""they work for the building not us, they probably don't care"" I went to the bathroom and cleaned up. I came back to he office and M was dressed and getting coffee. Me ""Well that was incredibly fun"". M ""you need to choose something. You can keep fucking me in which case you have to be transferred or quit. Or we can never talk about this again"". I grabbed my bag and headed home, weak knees and freshly fucked. I couldn't believe I just fucked another man, my boss. I didn't see M again till after the new year. We haven't spoken about that night since. I did put in for a transfer on the 2nd though. H.R. is looking for a slot for me. 😉",
131,"AITA For Telling Everyone My Gf Cheated On Me?I'm M23 and my gf is f23, been together for 2 years now and she went to a Halloween party few weeks ago and admitted to going home with a guy. She didn't even come clean to me, one of my boys who was at the party saw them making out at the party then leave together and told me. I confronted her about this the day after and she started crying and admitted it and I dumped her ass. Since its been a few weeks basically all her friends, my friends, her parents, my parents, her boss (who lives beside me) etc know that we broke up. And they've been texting asking what happened or running into me in person and asking what happened. I tell them why I dumped her and they are shocked as it was out of character for her. She contacted me today and basically went off on me for telling everyone our business and making her look bad, she was especially mad that I told her parents and her boss. But her dad called me and asked and her boss who's my neighbour saw me doing some yard work and asked about her etc. I didn't want to lie to them or anyone so I told her that I just told the truth to everyone and she deserves to feel embarrassed. She called me a huge asshole/douche and said that she's contacted the police about it for some reason. &#x200B; AITA?",
132,My (m21) gf(f21) cheated on me.I shouldn’t have snooped on her phone. But I did and now i regret it. Im writting this shaking and with one hand because im cuddling her atm. She’s asleep atm. I found an old text with her boss talking about how she had sex with one of her co workers during a night out to drink. That very same night i left my house at around 1 in the morning to pick her up after her night out. Reddit Im very confused. I want to leave right now in the middle of the night. I din’t want to break up with her because i really love her. We are in fact planning on getting married soon. I don’t want to forgive her because even now i feel like an idiot. I don’t even know how to bring it up. I really don’t know what to do.,
134,"My husband cheated on me with my best friend. Can a cheater change? Should I give him a second chance?My husband and my best friend. Should I forgive him? My husband and I met 16 years ago in grad school and we have been married for 12.5 years. We have two kids. 10 years ago I met this woman at work and she became one of my best friends. Her husband became my husband’s best friend. We hung out together as families and our kids played together. She has a history of depression and I was always there to support her through her tough times. My husband, myself and her also worked at the same company. My husband and her were in the same project for a few years and they were also good friends. 4 years ago both my husband and her switched jobs for unrelated reasons. Our friendships remained as strong as before. Her life was stressful the past few years due to her being in and out of hospitals due to her depression, finances, kids and marriage. Two weeks ago she was depressed and asked to meet me. I had made plans to see her that Friday night, but never heard back from her. My husband told me that he also got the same message from her as I did and he was worried about her and went to check on her that Friday afternoon. He said her husband came home from work at that time and became suspicious seeing the two of them in the house. He told me that he has also been meeting her to help her with work and her depression the past few years and he did not tell me since he thought it might be misunderstood. I did not think much of it since I knew my husband was her friend too and I trusted him blindly. I told him everything will be alright and I will talk to her husband and clear things up. I couldn’t sleep that night and I decided to check his iCloud. I was shocked to see that he has been meeting her for lunch frequently since they both switched jobs 4 years ago and she was his best friend more than she was mine. I did not see any incriminating messages but I saw a message from a year ago where they talked about switching to Signal (encrypted messaging app) and I don’t have any messages after that. At this point I felt betrayed by both of them and I called her. She admitted that they have been very good friends the past few years and they have been having an affair since she got out of the hospital in October 2019 for about 3 months. She said she was suffering, he was there to support her and they both were so involved in their own world that they did not think about the consequences. My world just collapsed under me at that moment. My husband is begging for forgiveness and second chance. He says they were just friends all of these years and the affair started due to a spur of the moment lapse of judgement and he felt very guilty every time and tried to stop multiple times. He says he is committed to regain my trust and will do every thing to prove that he is committed. He says there was nothing wrong in our marriage or me and what ever happened is due to his selfish ness and curiosity. He says he did not think about the consequences, thought he will end it, get away with it and it will never come out. He says he wanted to end it the first time they had sex, but she did not want to end it and kept initiating contact and he could not stop. He has given me all the details of the affair, blocked her on his phone, promised to see a therapist to figure out what led him into this path. How can I trust him again? He was at her house just two weeks back and if her husband did not come home, none of this would have come up. The future he is promising for us with his version 2.0 is too good to be true. However, all these lies, manipulation and betrayal is too much for me to handle and I find it hard to believe a single word he says. If he loved(s) me and the kids so much, where was I in his mind when they first kissed, first had sex and then continue to have sex? He says he was guilty each time, and did not want to do it, but still continued to do it 5 times. I am absolutely heart broken and moved him to the guest room. My thoughts are all over the place and I now see all the events that occurred in the past 10 years with a different light. I don’t know what to do. I am 38 years old and my husband is my first and only love. A month back, we were planning our retirement accounts, kids college funds, our next vacation and I thought I had it all and life can’t be any better. My husband and I had our share of fights in the mid years of our marriage but figured our way through. Is it possible for a cheater to change? Can his selfish nature change if he worked on it? Though he denies it, what if he has an emotional bond with her and was in love with her, but wants to be with me just for the sake of kids or society? What if she makes contact again and he gets drawn towards her again? I am at a loss and have no clue how men think and feel like I have been living with a stranger.",
135,"WIBTA if I told my recent ex's dad that she cheated on me?I'll try and keep this short. Girlfriend (now ex) cheated on me multiple times, I tried to put it behind me and she claimed she wouldn't do it again every time. Found out around 2 months ago that she still was keeping in touch with that guy and even met him. She never gave a straight-up confession and always trickle-truthed. Basically, the entire relationship was filled with lies and manipulation. She is just a very selfish person. For slightly more details, you can read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/efuz77/when_does_the_pain_stop/). In between the relationship (when I thought she had been clean for a long time), her parents came to visit her (they live pretty far away in another state). She had me meet her parents for dinner and they really liked me. Me being a local here, the next day I drove her and her parents and showed them around the city, from morning till night. Her dad even gave me a wallet as a gift and invited me to visit his state someday, saying I could stay with them and they would also show me around the entire state. I admire her dad for he is a man who reached a very good position because of his own hard work despite him coming from a difficult background. He is a man of principles and values. We have kept in touch occasionally since then over texts. Now, she being the person she is, she would never tell him the truth as to why we broke up. And I think he should know why. He should know why I am not going to be a part of his daughter's life anymore. I'll be honest, one motive of me telling him this is because I want her to fall down in his eyes. I want him to know that his daughter whom I so dearly loved and wanted to spend my life with has hurt me bad. And he would understand the pain because he has dealt with infidelity in his marriage in the past. So, WIBTA if I did that? # Edit: Another reason for wanting to tell her father that I left out intentionally was that she is not going to change as a person unless she faces repercussions for her actions. And her dad coming to know of her actions can be a big catalyst. I left out this reason from my original post because I figured it is not my place to want to change her as a person anymore as I want nothing to do with her anymore. I think I'll refrain from telling her dad after all, after reading all your replies. Damn, that was tough to go through.",

139,My (27m) wife 28 (f) cheated on me with mutual friend (25m)So to begin me and my wife have been wonderfully married for 2 years now. Everything has been great and we have a amazing 3 year old boy. So one night we decided to have a few friends over. So we had some alchohol and were getting pretty drunk by the end of the night. So I said good night at about 1 am to my wife and my mutual friend (Eli) so for the night I was sleeping. I woke up quite early (around 7am) and went downstairs to make myself some coffee. Typically when I go to sleep before my wife she sleeps on the couch because she hates my snoring so I didnt think anything was unusual . But when I walked downstairs I still saw eli sleeping on a separate couch. Again nothing unusual he was way to drunk to drive home.anyway. but I saw a use condom in the trashcan when I went to throw away a plastic cup. I flipped out. And immediately confronted them. They didnt bother denying it and apologized refusley. I told eli to get the fuck out and he hurried off. So now I am at a dilemma do I file for divorce and play the custody battle with my wife over our son or do I go to counseling and try to make up. Edit : taking a paternity test on the kid. Hoping he is mine and will proceed from there,
140,"I am divorcing my wife because she cheated on me and I cannot forgive/forget is this wrong?Me and my STBXW were together for 6 years total, married for 2, no kids, no house. I am divorcing my STBXW because she fell in love with someone else and had a relationship with them for 3 months last year. **Is it wrong to not be able to forgive or forget an infidelity even if the other person shows remorse and willingness to change? I just cant ever trust my STBXW. I think she will cheat again.** I want to hold her accountable, and move on with my life and have a marriage with someone who didn't betray me. All the advice about infidelity seems to be about repairing a relationship, not about moving on. Does anyone else feel that no matter what, things will never be the same? **MY STORY:** I am divorcing my STBXW because in January of 2019 she left me for another man that she fell in love with and had a relationship with him for 3 months last year (2019). I got on my knees and literally begged her not to leave me, but I ended up moving out of our common apartment during this time and filed divorce papers. After she expressed a ton of remorse, she and I then got back together in April 2019, and we lived together. During the time we tried reconciling, she was telling me how she missed the other guy, and how she was depressed, and how she was worried she wouldn't find another relationship like that again. I finally got fed up and kicked her out in September of 2019. I have since then tried to reconcile with her at least 2 more times - each time it has failed. She has been doing everything she can to win me back, but I just cannot forgive or forget. After I found out she went on a date with a dude from Hinge, even though she claims it was platonic, there is just no way I can trust her - it is the last straw. I just left her for the final time this weekend, letting her know that there is no way I will ever forgive and forget.",
141,"My [29M] girlfriend [28F] of 5 years emotionally cheated on me with an autistic guy who calls her ""little rat"" and uses behaviorist techniques to manipulate her**tl;dr**: My girlfriend of 5 years has been emotionally cheating on me for a year. She was in an abusive relationship with an autistic guy who calls her ""little rat"" and uses behaviorism to manipulate her. She went along with it and has been leading both him and me on for a year. I asked her to leave our apartment and I'm thinking what to do. I'm going back to therapy tomorrow. ---- She met this classmate when she began her master's degree a year and a half ago. For at least the past year, they've had an emotional and abusive relationship. He tells her how to feel and what to do, and she obliges. And she gives him hope that they might be together someday. But it gets a lot worse, and a lot weirder. He's a high-functioning autist, and suggested she is an autist too. In fact, he informally diagnosed her, despite not being a doctor at all, and she apparently believed this quite quickly. They became closer and closer as they searched together for an official diagnosis of autism for her. He'd tell her which doctors to go to, and even went with her and kept constant contact with her psychiatrist throughout her tests. He and the psychiatrist would talk for hours about her case, and he constantly tried to push this diagnosis onto her and the psychiatrist. He calls her ""little rat"". She says she didn't like this nickname at first, but she never stopped him. He kept using it and eventually she started calling him ""little rat"" too, and together they were ""little rats"" who do things like ""have little rat coffee"", which was meeting at a coffee shop to talk. There were some common phrases he used like ""little rats help each other"" to keep them together. He also called her a ""silly little rat"" when she did things he didn't like, or a ""runaway little rat"" if she distanced herself from him even a little bit. She never complained about this name calling. If she behaved how he wanted, she was a “smart little rat” or an “assertive little rat”. He would talk about behaviorism sometimes. I know all this because I have all their texts between March 2019 and now. She gave them to me after I confronted her with a few questions. It began with me asking how she’d get to the psychiatrist for her final diagnosis, and she answered it was by boat. This is highly unusual. I asked her how she went there last time, and she said her autistic friend took her. I said I felt upset that she hadn’t asked me to go and support her instead. Later, I asked why the autistic friend hadn’t been at an important academic event for her that I had gone to. She confessed that it was because he liked her and didn’t want to be in the same place as her boyfriend. I asked her if she liked him, and she said no. I asked a lot of questions. I got partial truths or outright lies at first, but as I kept asking, she revealed more and more. She thought of leaving me to be with him. She thought about what it’d be like to kiss him, and to have sex with him. She admitted that she emotionally cheated on me. After this admission, I asked her “did you cheat on me?” and she said no. I explained that she had just admitted emotionally cheating, and asked again. She said “I don’t know”. I explained more and tried once again, and she said yes. This is how a lot of the questioning would go. She says they never kissed or had sex, but this is irrelevant to me at this point. She had her part in this too. She let herself into that relationship, and kept it going. She invited him to do a Psychology undergrad together for 5 years after they finish their master's, which hasn't happened yet. This was so they could follow their master plan of diagnosing her, working and researching together, creating apps and games for autistic children and having a successful company in the autism space, particularly in diagnosing. He promised her a job and a MacBook Air. She played him just as much as he played her, promising a future together. He'd tell her he liked her and they had to find a solution to their problem (me), but she led him on, always telling him they’d figure something out eventually. This past year, she’s been depressed a lot of the time and suicidal for a few weeks. I was her suicide watcher for several days, as she had she had a fantasy of jumping out of my bedroom window. This was a terrible time for us. She was adjusting her medication, and, meanwhile and unknown to me, he was telling her how her depression wasn’t that bad, her suicidal thoughts were nothing, her suicide watch was unnecessary, and telling her which medications she could and couldn’t take. Initially, I told her we’d work through this together. I asked her not to contact him ever again, and to be completely honest with me from now on, and hide nothing. The next day, she hid something else from me. She threw a little piece of paper he had given her in the toilet trash, along with a rat origami he had given her (called Sam). That day, I was reading their texts (over 20k messages total) and happened to stumble upon them talking about a “Certification” he had given her, and one she had given him. I asked her about this, and she told me she had trashed it earlier. I started going through the trash and she came over to help me. She found it – it was carefully wrapped in toilet paper so that I wouldn’t find it – and I read it. It said: > “The Federal Council of Little Rats confers this certification to [her name], in recognition of her constant effort, intervention and kindness throughout the year of 2019.” She had given him one too. It was about how he was the first person to recognize her potential. This stung very deep, because I was always extremely supportive of her and worked so hard to help her reach her potential. After a few days of asking questions and gathering material, I asked her to leave our apartment, which we just rented together. I asked her to give me time to think, but she’s been messaging me. I thought she was showing interest in keeping our relationship together, but now I fear that she’s just trying to manipulate me into staying. He has been messaging her too, and, while she hasn’t replied, his messages to her are very similar to her messages to me. They both apologize, show impatience, make subtle criticisms, offer distance but admit they weren’t able to give space, say they didn’t mean to do this, invoke good memories, mention their own suffering to appear as a victim, impose feelings onto the other person, and magnify their problems. It’s hard to see all this from a person I’ve been with for 5 years, and whom I’ve loved so much. I knew she was talking to this guy, and that he had suggested she had autism, and that she was taking tests, but that’s all I knew. I had an intuition something was wrong, but I trusted her. I'm going back to therapy tomorrow. I'd also like to say that I have nothing against autists, and what happened has little to do with autism in my opinion. It's actually about abusive and emotionally sick people. He'd tell her what to expect from the autism tests, and they'd discuss strategies on how to bypass the ""bias detection"" that might catch her in *wanting* to be diagnosed with autism. This is one of their conversation after she finished a test: >Him: Were you “good”? >Her: I think I was a little rat >Him: Then great 🐭 When I asked her about this, she admitted that ""good"" meant displaying autistic traits.",
142,"AITA for not wanting my husband to go to his 15 year high school reunion, because the woman he cheated on me with will be there? I’ll call my husband Kyle and his ex Chelsea. Kyle and I met when I was 19 and he was 21. We are now 33 and 31. Kyle and Chelsea were high school sweethearts and early college sweethearts. Kyle and I met shortly after he and Chelsea broke up. I think they always figured they’d end up together. But Kyle and I got together. About two years into dating Kyle, we moved in together (bad idea. We were too young and too dumb). We treated each other poorly, but Kyle cheated and had a few month long affair with Chelsea. I was always... insecure, I guess?, about Chelsea. Part of it was how they broke up, how quickly we got together thereafter, part of it was probably my age. It was an ugly moment when I found out he was cheating with Chelsea. We broke up and then were on and off for about nine months after - I’d want Kyle and he’d go to Chelsea, then he’d want me and I’d go out with someone else to hurt him, then he’d go back to Chelsea, etc etc. Yes, we were still living together and yes it was as awful as you could imagine. Shortly before my 23rd birthday, Kyle and I split up. I accepted a job two hours away (near his hometown, actually! But it was fine, he said he never wanted to go back there so it was Kyle free), and we didn’t speak for two years. He still texted me on my birthday. I never responded. On my 25th birthday, I ran into Kyle at a bar. Turns out he moved to where he said he never would. We started catching up and laughing and chatting. He texted me that night saying he’d love to hang out. I refused him for awhile. A long while. Finally, I agreed to see him, but said no sex for three months, figuring it would show me if he was really interested in me. He stuck around. We got married a year later. I’ve never doubted Kyle since we got back together. He’s an amazing husband and father and God bless the broken road and all that. Kyle was just invited to his 15 year reunion. Spouses aren’t invited. Chelsea found him on facebook and messaged him asking if he’d be there, she’d love to meet up. I... really don’t want my husband going. I absolutely trust him. But it makes me uncomfortable. I know he wants to go though. He swears nothing will happen, but the idea of him being there, with her, just doesn’t feel right. AITA?",

144,"Do you think he cheated on me? Am I paranoid? Did I make the right choice? I left him and I regret it, help!It’s kind of a long story so I’ll simplify it as much as possible. I would love to hear everyone’s opinions and insight on this. A month ago I saw a cum stain on his shirt, it could have been from me however he weren’t having frequent sex and when we do typically sits before bed and he doesn’t wear shirts- it led me to look into his boxers and a few had cum stains on the front inside of them! He dismissed the shirt saying it was from me and he had pulled it out of the dirty laundry, I dropped it and never brought up the boxers. A few weeks ago I caught my boyfriend hanging out with a girl in the loft he works out of (he’s a designer) this girl posted videos of herself wearing his pieces and also took videos of pieces he was working on. She looks kind of like a party girl, very loose posts pictures with men often and also seems to be a rapper groupie ( the type of girl who takes pictures with her middle finger up holding a bottle of patron or a blunt and posts it on IG). The day I saw it I initially confronted him, he said he did not cheat on me and it was innocent. I have an 8 year old son that he’s helped me raise, his father passed away when he was 4 so my boyfriend is all he’s ever known as a father, I also pay majority of the bills, I work very hard and I own two cars- one of which he drives because he does not have the money to afford his own considering he makes 15,000 a year if he’s lucky. The night he hung out with her he was watching my son while I worked and dropped my son off to his sister at 7pm to go do some “work” at the loft, when I was texting him regarding money issues on his end, he told me to leave him alone because I’m annoying and distracting him from his work. I tried to drop the situation with the girl and get past it but the story of how she got there in the first place seemed to change, first he said he doesn’t even know her she came with one of his friends, then it was she’s an old friend direct messaged me on Instagram and came by to see my work and lastly he said they ran into each other in person and she came by to see his work. He apologized told me he loved me and wouldnt cheat on me, he said he shouldn’t have had her at the loft. A week of thinking about how I knew something wasn’t right and I had a bad gut feeling like he’s lying to me because from what it looks like he’s known her since 2015. I asked him finally to show me the conversation that took place between them before she came to his house, he refused to show me it. He claimed “it was not an ill minded conversation I don’t need to show you”. I thought about the situation for a week before making any firm choices. I asked multiple times to please see the conversation. Finally I gave him an ultimatum because not only was this girl an issue I was having but his lack of money has been an issue along with his lax lifestyle. I told him either show me the conversation or you have to move out, even if he did cheat I would rather move forward knowing the truth.He refused to show the conversation. I did not cave I told him he still had to leave, he picked his things, gave up on our relationship and called an Uber. Yesterday we were still sharing locations on our iPhone and he stopped sharing his, I didn’t want to un share mine because I wanted him to watch me. I figured my ex would look at my location and I was hoping he would obsess over the fact that I wasn’t home. He was very controlling and didn’t like when I went out or hung out with anyone. The next morning I unshared my location with my ex. Today I texted him to see how he’s doing because I don’t think he took the breakup well either, and he is completely ignorining me. I love him so much. I just want him to understand what I’m going through and how I feel... My son keeps asking if he’s coming home or if he will see him again. I’ve been texting him and asking him why he’s ignoring me when he is the one who caused this whole situation to unfold. I want him to grow up and change because I know he loves me, my son and our dog. I know he’s mad because I kicked him out however I feel I had no choice, I needed to put my foot down because he doesn’t seem to respect me. If you weren’t cheating wouldn’t you just show the conversation? What do I do?",
145,"Just found out that my wife and mother of my 2 kids cheated on me.Looked up “wife cheated on me” and here I am. I found a wayward text on her phone, and I put all of the pieces together. She’s been acting weird since last summer, and now I know why. Making up “excuses” to be gone after 7-8 PM: Needing to return a library book, needed to go grocery shopping and take 2 hours, being at the gym from 8 PM to 11 PM (no one works out for that long!), going over her “parent’s house”, etc. There’s probably more that I’m forgetting. It wasn’t just at night either. Anyways, she actually admitted some things to me. She had sex with someone that I don’t know named “R”. Don’t know his full name. Claims it happened “once”. Ha, sure. I have no idea who this person could be. She’s never dated anyone whose name starts with an R that I’m aware of. It’s driving me crazy, but I guess it doesn’t matter at the end. Her reasonings were brutal: •Not enough sex, affection and “intimacy” from me. I’m not a touchy feely person, so she cheats. •Bored with her life, marriage and motherhood. Don’t get that one? At all? She has an amazing life! •I don’t make her cum ever, apparently. I don’t listen to her when she tells me what she wants in bed. •Bad sex life. Makes me feel terrific, BTW. I don’t know. Not enough reasons to cheat, IMO. I WOULD NEVER CHEAT ON HER. I’ve never even thought about it, except maybe a random time with a coworker (nothing happened, even though it could have). Now I guess I won’t turn down sex from coworkers and acquaintances! I won’t have any chance with the girls that I want sex with because they’re all terrified of my wife. Genuinely terrified, they’ve told me so. This was just a vent, so I’m rambling. Not sure if I can move past this, but we have 2 young kids together.",
146,"My ex told me exactly why he won’t cut off his best friend (aka the one he cheated on me with) TW: (rape and sexual abuse/assault)Soooo. Last time I was here, my ex was talking about reconciling. I told him I’d be willing to if he cuts his friend off, and he said no and instead graciously offered to never talk about her in front of me. I said no. Well, turns out, she’s going through a lot right now. Her dad’s a fucking pervert and is peeping on her when she sleeps. Masturbating to her. She caught him in the act and has solid proof that it is happening. She’s currently staying with another family member before he tries to take it further. Mind you, my ex is telling me this and showing me texts they had since November about what’s going on, so in that instance, I can believe him when he says that. Now here’s where I feel conflicted. I don’t believe in the notion that anybody deserves to be raped or feel uncomfortable. I am genuinely happy that she is not in that situation anymore because as a woman who was peeped on and raped by an ex boyfriend in high school, I can say that literally NOBODY deserves that, even if I don’t like her. At the same time, I still feel some kind of way about it because yes, she does need support, and I’m glad my ex is offering her that support, but it still kind of rubs me the wrong way that he’s talking to her and will continue to do so if we were to reconcile. I’m not saying she doesn’t deserve support. She deserves all the support she can get because that’s a fucked up situation. I just have this weird twinge telling me that I’m wrong for not being supportive of my ex being there for her if we were to reconcile, if this makes any sense. My ex has his heart in the right place and he cheated on me, but he’s not a bad overall person, so it makes sense she’s coming to him for support. I just feel like I both can get behind him being there for her and can’t get behind him being there for her. It’s weird and I’m not honestly sure what to think or feel about what’s going on. I just feel like an asshole. Idk. Help",
147,"I (25F) discovered today that my bf (30M) cheated on me and I'm scheduled to go on a trip with his entire friend group in a few weeks.After the ball dropped, I ubered back to my boyfriend's place and found out from his (30M) roommate (30M) that he told him we were open and has taken full advantage of that status over our last few months of dating in our 1.5-year relationship, at least one time in their own home with the roommate present and I'm assuming more outside of the house. I travel a lot for work and we've had trust issues so this is unsurprising but extremely validating of the many hours I spent in the mentally draining cycle of suspicion/guilt. Ironically, I always told him that I'd be fine with an open relationship, as long as we communicated, but he didn't seem to like the idea. He likes to spin tall tales, is extremely insecure, and has been accused of cheating in past relationships. I told roomie (30M) that I would not list him as my source because they go way back and I appreciate him telling me. The friend also was a little odd in his delivery and touched my knee while telling me and alluded to us being together in a very vague sense. Despite this creepy behavior, I trust him and what he told me because we've always looked out for each other when it came to my boyfriend. We're both self-hating empaths and tend to get caught up in situations like the one I'm describing. I'm scheduled to go on a 12-person vacation to New Orleans for 5 days, all 12 people being his friend group who we also celebrated NYE with. While I get along with everyone well, I only have one person's number (a non-organizer of the trip). BF purchased the tickets and I already venmoed him for mine and have yet to venmo more for the lodging. I need advice as to next steps, because last night when he returned home, I was shaking hard, drunk/high, and having a mental flood of relief/disappointment from the news to even move or speak. TL;DR: My boyfriend cheated on me, as verified by his roommate. I need advice on how to back out of the now awkward vacation with him without listing roommate as my source.",
148,"Husband cheated on me with a prostituteI need your support and wisdom. We are in our thirties. Dated for 11 years and married for 2. On Feb 5, after I attended my evening class, my husband told me that he cheated on me several hours ago with a prostitute. I have cross posted because I need more support...I don’t know what to do We haven’t had sex lately, and I wondered why he didn’t why but he’s just been gaming nonstop after work everyday. He says he is stressed at work and gaming helps him destress. I did catch him once masturbating to porn a year ago, and in retrospect I realize I should’ve seen that as a red flag then. Back then he told me that even though he watches porn he reassured me that he would never “cross the line.” Well, here we are. He says there is “no strings attached” because she’s a prostitute and it’s his “first time.” He is begging for me to give him a chance to make things right. I don’t have the strength yet to even ask him how long this has been going on. He says he has “resisted temptation” for many weeks prior so even though the physical cheating happened on Feb 5, the emotional cheating (sexting probably and who knows what else) happened way before. I’ve lived more than a third of my life with him. I’m just very lost. I’ve just been crying all day yesterday. I didn’t eat a thing because I had no appetite. He made me eat something as he took a day off yesterday to apologize and whatever. He was my best friend. And he just single-handedly destroyed our marriage with his selfishness and greed and lust. We will get STI testing. He says he wants to do it together so he can “prove” to me he’s clean. I, if not us both, will definitely need therapy. I just don’t know where to go from here. I don’t even know what I want. Reassurance that you’ve survived this and is now working out? Wisdom to leave now before he does it again? We have no kids so it will be a relatively “easy” divorce. But I can’t even think about divorce yet. I can barely process what happened to my life and my marriage overnight. Please help me...",
149,"My(M24) gf(23) cheated on me every Friday with a guy that she invited out every Friday for a month with her co-workers.Quick background, I work from home she works in the city and we've been together for 4 years and have know each other for 5. We also have lived together and still do for about 2 years. She just started her career this October and I found out that she has been cheating on me every Friday in December with the ex bf of her best friend(F) . She would message him in snap chat and invite him out to drink with her and her coworkers and I found out they would kiss but allegedly nothing more. He would walk her to the train station and I would pick her up when she gets into town. I am utterly heartbroken, I don't know if they did more, I can't sleep or anything. I almost left her new years eve, I had my bags packed, I just couldn't go through with it. She said that she did it at first because it was exciting and new and she found the guy very attractive. She said she loved the attention. I love her and I don't know if I should try to make it work, I have love her unconditionally since we started off as friends. I can't sleep, I can barely function at work without thinking of her kissing this other person and within an hour kissing me when picking her up at the station. I don't know what to do and right now I'm on my way to happy hour with her co-workers for the first time. I am truly lost please anyone help.",
151,"Posted once before and it helped me remember my worth massively. Today I found out that my ex who refused to commit to me after 4 years, has bought a house with the girl he cheated on me with after only a year together. But fuck ‘em. I get to go travelling in New Zealand soon!",
152,"AITA for kicking my room mate out of my apartment because my girl friend cheated on me with him?So I've lived in my apartment with my room mate since December of last year. We weren't (And still aren't) really friends, but I never had a problem with him. Until yesterday, that is. Yesterday I found out that he and my gf had been in a secret relationship. One of my gf's friends that we hung out with sometimes told me, and that's how I found out. Me and her were chilling in my room in my apartment watching youtube and playing video games and she told me about how my gf had told her that she was breaking up with me soon, and that she'd already found a replacement. I decided not to freak out about it, at least at first, and after another hour or so she left. Then I went down and confronted my room mate. I told him to get out and that he could go live with his bitch, and I called her and told her that her boytoy was on his way. She keeps trying to call me and she sent me a couple texts calling me an asshole. My room mate told a few of my friends that he has on his contact list that I had thrown him out for no reason. Now they're calling me and asking if it's true. I'm calling and texting people making sure they know the full story, but a few people that are friends with my room mate and gf are saying i'm an ass, I should have handled it differently, I should have let her explain herself, etc etc. I honestly think I didn't do anything wrong, but I'm starting to question it. AITA? Edit: My gf (Ex now) admitted to cheating in a text. She asked to explain herself because it 'wasn't how it looked.' Edit 2: This is my reply to a comment. It gives some additional info. Here it is: ""He isn't on the lease. I talked with my landlord and he said it was okay for him to live there, as long as I pay for any damage or damages done to the building that my room mate is responsible for, if he were to cause damage to the building, that is. I wrote up a contract. It was really simple. He gives he $100 every month to pay rent, and he can live there. (The rent is $350 a month.) It also said that I could kick him out at any time, if I so pleased, the only condition being that I had to give him a week minimum to get all his things out, and he didn't have to pay his share of that month's rent, if he hadn't already paid it."" Edit 3: My gf had been acting weird not long before this, which made me suspicious already. I had a talk with her and we discussed loyalty and cheating. She seemed nervous during the talk, but I didn't want to jump to conclusions. My gf actually canceled on me once and it was the same night that my room mate went out. When I heard that she had cheated on me from a reliable source, I didn't question the validity of the claim. I didn't want to overshare information, because it's my personal life after all, but I see that it will probably help if I gave this information. Edit 4: (PLEASE READ) A lot of people seem to be confused on whether the eviction was legal. I've been looking into it for a few hours now and from what I can tell what I did was perfectly legal where I live.",
153,"My (23M) Fiance (21F) cheated on me. Idk what to do anymoreMe and my fiance have been together since May. She told me in the beginning she didnt know if she wanted to be in a relationship. She said she always fucked it up but liked me so much she wanted to put a label on it. We went through hell in our first couple months together, I got her pregnant in the beginning.I stood by her side and helped her with everything. Whatever decision she wanted to make I would stand by it, the pregnancy turned out to be ectopic. I helped pay for everything, found out she had a cyst in her ovary and held her hand as she got ready for surgery. I spoon fed her ice when she was out. She was my goddamn world, she made me feel like I was the only person in the world. When she looked at me she would smile and start tearing up saying she doesnt deserve someone like me in her life and she feels so lucky. I sat her parents down and asked for their blessing and they said yes because I was the first guy to make their daughter a good person, and communicate with them again. Reddit when I say this girl was the one I fucking meant it. I never met anyone like her in my life, she seemed like she would die for me if I asked. We went 4 months without a single argument. It was heaven. We were together for 7 months. One day I wake up and my penis hurts, it gets swollen and we think maybe it's a uti. I was going to the hospital that day and she hugged me and told me she loved me and Hopes it's nothing serious. The doctor told me it was ghonnerea. My whole world shattered. I ended up calling her asking her if she cheated on me and she stayed quiet for 10 sec and said ""did you cheat on me?"". She texted me after cus I had to drive and said she didnt want to be with me for awhile. She said she loved me ""in the beginning"". I asked her what she meant and she said the first 3 months... I gave her my car reddit. She drove my car to work everyday and she drove it to go have sex with someone without a condom in my car after work, while wearing my goddamn wedding ring! Then she texted me that day and told me she cant wait to come home and cuddle and kiss. She came home and kissed me and told me she loved me like it was a normal day. She cheated on me a month ago. A couple weeks ago I almost broke up with her because I felt like something was different and maybe I didnt make her happyx she begged me for 6 hours to not break up with her. 6 fucking hours she begged me. She told me she cheated because it was easier to break up like that?????!?!?!?! Why would she say that and then never tell me she cheated what's the point? She hurt me. I would give anything for this to be a bad dream, I havent slept in 21 hours, I took a 10 min nap and dreamt this situation, when I woke up I thought it was a dream and looked over to see if she was next to me so I could hold her and then I realized I'm back at my moms again. I just want to hold her. Her personality changed like a switch. I felt like I was talking to a stranger. This is the same person who told me she hated cheating, she said what's the point of cheating if you dont want to be with someone break up with them. Sorry for the rambling. Shes the best liar I ever met. Idk how to get over this... Edit: She was at a party while I was at home crying. My friend said she was drinking all night and having a good time. Her dad texted me this morning and said she never came home. She left with someone else. Tl;dr: fiance cheated on me. I found out cus I tested positive for ghonnerea. I have no idea how to move on, I feel like my world has been ripped apart.",
154,"Girlfriend cheated on me, I couldn't care less.Last night my girlfriend came to me in tears saying she cheated and that she'll never do it again. Throughout the whole conversation I just didn't feel anything, it was like she was asking me what kind of coffee I liked. Afterwards I started making myself dinner. She's been hardcore tip toeing around me ever since, doing favors, being nice etc. I think she expects me to just explode on her. This got me thinking. Have any of you been cheated on by significant others? What was your reaction?",
155,"My wife cheated on me 5 months after getting marriedHello everyone, here's my very long story. Thank you in advance for reading it. I think it's the longest and most honest and heartfelt post I've ever made anywhere. I hope it makes sense and isn't incoherent. So here goes: I met my wife (we're both 32) at the end of 2008 in my freshman year at university. I was 21 by that time and never had a girlfriend before. We got closer, became very good friends and eventually started a relationship in 2011. In 2013 I moved into her apartment. Things were really great, we traveled a lot, had great sex, supported each other during our studies etc. Things weren't always good of course, she kept nagging me a lot about things I should be doing, like putting back cleaned laundry, emptying the dishwasher, taking out the garbage.. stuff like that. Small things. I've always been a very laid back dude and a master of procrastination, and those things annoyed her a lot. We had a lot of discussions over the years, I always promised change would come.. but after some time I'd go back to my habits and we'd argue about the same things again and again every few months. I also get angry very easily, at small things. Not at her, but i.e. stupid people in traffic would get me super angry. Maybe I need anger management, I don't know. At the end of 2017 after she got her doctors degree we both decided to move to a different city and both get jobs there. I was unhappy with my job back then and there weren't many IT job opportunities there. We moved (only one hour drive away) and left everything behind. On her 31st birthday in September 2018 I asked her to marry me and she said yes. We got married last August exactly 8 years after our relationship started. On our wedding day one of her work colleagues she invited couldn't bring her boyfriend, so she brought another guy from work with her. Let's call him James. My wife was happy that he came and introduced James to me as her walking buddy. The three of them always take walks during their lunch break. October and November were really busy months for her, she had to go to a lot of IT fairs, conferences, meetings and stuff. She had to do a lot of work after coming home. We didn't really spend that much time doing stuff together. She had to work while I was sitting in front of the TV. We kinda lived next to each other, not together. In November my wife and James had to go to a fair and when they came back he stayed the night over because he lives a lot further away from their workplace than we do. The next day they had their work Christmas event, so I drove them there and he slept at our place again that night. Around one month ago at the beginning of December I finally told her that our relationship was completely broken and wanted to talk about how we could bring things back to how they were. I suggested doing a few weekend trips to spend some more time together. She was sad, but agreed and life went on. She still had lots to do for work which she apologized for and said things would get better in the new year and that she couldn't wait for the holiday break to come so we could spend more time together. Well, two weeks later I come home from the gym, take a shower and I find her in bed looking sad. I asked her if she was ok and her answer started a huge avalanche. She said she had spent those two weeks thinking about our relationship. She hoped (yet again) that I would finally change after getting married, said that getting married was probably a mistake and that we should take some time off and figure things out. She hates that my fits of anger went over to her and that she's never been this way before. She couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, lost 10 Kg in those two weeks. I was devastated and don't quite remember what I said to her. We both decided we would spend the holidays like planned and shouldn't speak to our families about this. One of her oldest girlfriends was the only person she had told about all of this. She asked if it was ok if she went to her friend from work for the night and told me she would spend the next day (Thursday, her first day off work) at James' place and would return in the evening. After packing a few things she left. She didn't come back until Friday morning. That day we were invited to a wedding, so she came home, took a shower, got dressed and we went on our way. After the wedding we drove to her mother's place. The weekend was weird, we didn't really talk about the issue and I tried my best to pretend everything was completely normal. By accident I noticed a fingerprint prompt on her phone when she opened Whatsapp and got skeptical. Later while trying to check something on her phone I noticed that neither my fingerprint nor her usual pin code wasn't working anymore. It hurt, but I kinda understood why she would do that. On Monday, December 23rd, we met up with a few friends (the girl she confided in was there as well) at the Christmas market in town and that's when I, again accidentally, glanced at her phone while she was typing and saw she was talking to James.. and saw lots and lots of kissing emoji. Seeing that fucked me up real bad. We went to a burger place, ate, and when walking back to the car I got to speak with her friend, told her how shitty I was feeling and that I just saw what she was writing to that dude. I was still very confident in the fact that there was nothing between them, yet seeing that still hurt a lot. The next day on Christmas Eve I confronted my wife. I asked if she lost trust in me so much that she had to completely lock her phone. She said it didn't have anything to do with trust and that she set up a fingerprint prompt in every app where it's possible. I didn't believe that. A few hours later I asked her if, hypothetically, she would be ok with me sending kissing emoji to another woman. She was a bit shocked and said no, she probably wouldn't be. Said that James noticed how bad she was feeling at work and offered to be there for her. Afterwards I left to visit my parents as planned. I tried to keep calm and be normal as best I could, but my parents still noticed that I was absent and sad. I told them I was just tired. The next day I got back to my wife. Her mother and stepdad left for the day and the plan was for my parents to come over there. They came, we ate, played a board game etc. Things were alright and I was a lot calmer than the days before. On December 26th we finally drove back home again. When we arrived she packed a few things and immediately left to go to James and told me she'd come back on Saturday, December 28th, because her cousin planned to visit via train and she didn't want to cancel. They spent the day in town and came back in the evening. We played a few card games and eventually her cousin was on the couch watching Netflix. My wife went to take a shower and I followed her into the bathroom to talk to her. I asked if I should get a new apartment and she said that we should probably both get a new apartment for the time being. She needed more time and didn't know if she wanted to give me another chance. She told me about her plan for the next week. She'd drive her cousin home and then go back to James again, where she would stay for a week. Our plan to spend New Year's Eve together with two of my best friends and their girls wouldn't work out of course. The next morning they left. I was alone and had lots of time to think. I told myself I had to change. Even if it didn't manage to save my marriage I knew I finally had to do something to be a better person. I spent the week alone as a new person. I immediately did chores, cleaned up after myself and so on. Still, the thought of her coming back was the only thing keeping me alive. I wanted to prove to her I could change and would do everything in my power to save this marriage. On New Year's Eve my best man and his girlfriend came earlier, so I told them everything. It was the first time I told anyone about this whole ordeal and it helped a lot. At midnight I wrote a short ""Happy New Year"" to my wife and she replied. Last Sunday she finally came back. When she came through the door she smiled a bit. I cried and hugged her. When we sat down she said she didn't know what to say anymore and she wanted me to speak up for a change. I told her I don't want to be like this anymore, I want to be a different person, that I needed to change for health reasons as well. Being angry all the time can't be good. I said that we swore to be faithful to one another during good and bad times in church, and that these were really bad times, but that I was hoping she would give me and the marriage another chance. To which she replied ""But I wasn't faithful to you last week. Something you probably suspected"". ""What?"", I asked incredulously. ""What does that mean? Did you have sex?"" Yes, they had sex. It wasn't to hurt me, she hadn't been this happy in months, it happened. She doesn't know if it was a big mistake. She doesn't know if she can believe me anymore. She just thought of herself for the first time in many many years. She didn't think she could depend on me. She wants to get some distance from me, which is why we should both move out. She didn't say anything about a divorce. She told her mother who is now totally shocked and wants her to give me another chance. I stayed relatively calm while she gathered a few more things and left again. I broke into tears, called my best man and immediately drove to him. I couldn't be alone. So she basically cheated on me with a dude I met on my wedding day, a dude that came over to our place a few times. She cheated on me after not even a month of contemplation, not even two full weeks of separation. I'm extremely hurt. I didn't think she was capable of something like this. I don't even know who this woman is anymore. I called her mother, who told me multiple times how sorry she is, how she knows exactly how I feel because she was in a similar situation, albeit after 20 years of marriage, not 5 months. I believe even her mother is on my side. Said my wife should've gone to another friend, to a hotel, or wherever during this separation phase. She wants her to be honest to me and give me another chance. But even if she did I don't think I'm capable of forgiving this. I will never see her with the same eyes again, never get the picture of her doing the other guy out of my head. It sickens me. Even if it turns out that she fucked up big time and does want to give this another chance.. how could I? I know I've made many mistakes in the last few years, but nothing that I did (or maybe didn't do) deserves such a break of trust. She threw almost 8,5 years in the can. After 5 months of marriage. I'm so sorry for everyone who invested time, money and love to come to our wedding from all corners of the world. I think the smartest way for me to go forward is to move out, forget her and file for divorce after a year (You have to be separated for at least a year before you can get a divorce in Germany). I need to be forward thinking and stop clinging to the past. But it still hurts so much and I'm extremely afraid of the future. &#x200B; Well, thanks again for going through all this. What do you think? Can this be forgiven? Do you have any other advice? Part of me feels like an idiot for managing to screw up a marriage this quick.",
156,"My GF cheated on me and was raped? Should I break up w her?I’m not sure if this is the right sub to be asking this, so I’m sorry if it’s not. Anyway, for context I’m a man (18M) and I have a girlfriend (18F) of almost one year, and we had a pretty committed relationship. Recently, she admitted to me that she has been cheating on me with another man for the past month and that the last time she saw him, he raped her. She admitted this three days ago, and I’ve spent that whole time comforting her because I love her and she went through something that no one should have to go through. But recently, I’ve been reconsidering our relationship. Throughout the time we’ve dated, I made it clear that loyalty is a big thing and she clearly doesn’t respect that if she cheated on me. She says that she loves me and that she wants to stay with me. And she’s cut things off permanently. with the other man. But I also know that if he hadn’t raped her, she would definitely still have been cheating on me with him. I know she is in a really vulnerable place right now and she says that she needs me to be there for her, and I want to support her through this because I really love her. But I also feel super betrayed that she would cheat on me. And I feel like breaking up with her right now would be such a dick move because I would be making her more sad when she’s already in a bad place. So should I break up with her? She was unfair to me, but I don’t wanna add to the pain she’s already going through.",

159,"My wife 33 [F] cheated on me 30 [M] . Long story inside. Comments and opinions are very welcomed and appreciated.Im writing this in search of finding a reason why my wife cheated. I've been with my wife for almost 4 years and married for 2 and half years. During this time we have had several instances of her being unfaithful to me with different men mostly through texts and Snapchat. While hurtful and disturbing none of this equalled to a full on affair. She told me that these instances were to validate herself and she didn't mean to hurt me. Each time she promised she was done doing that kind of thing and would be regretful for months afterwards. I would forgive her because I had faith in her and believed ending our relationship over words and pictures would be a mistake. This all changed in 2019. She started talking to an old co-worker she worked with as a teen. She told me about it initially and how he was hitting on her and she was going to stop talking to him. However she did not stop talking to him and it got out of hand and she was texting him none stop for days. When I found out I fell into a deep darkness and sought out therapy because I was suicidal over it. I was upset because she lied about talking to him and unlike guys before she was spending us time talking to him on her phone. This guy also had a six pack and a huge penis. I've told several of friends if I saw his picture and heard the story I would have laughed because of how ridiculous his body is. I have a dad bod and a semi attractive face. And my penis is average. She said she didn't do anything wrong initially and we had fights about it for days. Meanwhile my physical health was declining, I was getting bad heart palpitations. It led to a conversation where I told her if she couldn't stop talking to this person then we couldn't be together. She chose him over me. However hours later she apologized and we made up. Over the next few months I kept going to my weekly therapy sessions while she kept relapsing and talking to this person. She told me she was relapsing because she was worried about him and thought he was suicidal over a divorce he was going through. After the fourth time I caught her lying I drove off and said I was going to leave her. After this she stopped talking to him cold turkey for about five months. During this time he tried contacting her several times and each time she would tell me and would not reply That is until her dad passed away. After her dad passed she started talking to him again and they met up and after three meet ups they had sex. She initially implied when I found out about the affair that he had raped her ( sex without consent, forcing her cloths off) however later she admitted that was a lie. They had an affair for about six weeks until around Christmas time. During the time of the affair while I was unaware she was fucking another man. We had several large fights during the affair period. ( I thought they were related to her dad's passing unaware of the affair.) During these fights she told me I didn't trust her, she wasn't attracted to me anymore, I was socially awkward, my nail biting disgusted her, sex was boring, and we were not sexually compatible. She also told me on several occasions she wanted to leave me. However she's said she's wanted to leave me a bunch of times in the past and it's more of a ""nuke"" she uses rather than actually meaning it. She said I wasn't taking care of myself like I used to. (We have both put on weight since meeting). For the record imo at least, the sex between us was bad mainly because of her. She put little effort in the bedroom and left it up to me to order toys she wanted and once the toys she wanted were delivered she didn't want to use them ever. I have handcuffs that were used twice, a whip that was used twice, and a bunch of other stuff that is just sitting there. She also only orgasms through oral and she only lets me go down on her once a month if I'm lucky. My penetration game is lack luster. I'm 6'4 and have a hard time finding the right positions. Also my wife is dry down often there because there is no foreplay. She doesn't seem to understand foreplay is pretty much required for good sex in a LTR where the new car smell has warn off. I know she probably wasn't attracted to me so sex isn't exciting to her. After about a month the fights were dying down and stopped. I thought she stopped fighting with me because she wanted me to have a good Christmas and then drop divorce papers in the new year. Turns out her relationship with AP with going in a downward spiral. I found out about the affair a couple days before New year's. The affair was dying down when I saw she got a notification on snap chat. I saw aps name and I knew something was up. I asked her about it and was devastated after finding out she had slept with him. I had bad chest pains, threw up every morning for a week, and was having panic attacks at work. My wife was open about her affair (for the most part) and gave me most of the details I asked about not all at once though. She initially said she didn't have feelings for him and it was only physical. However I learned later on that she asked to spend the night at his house and when I asked her about that she said if she did she would have slept in a different room ( okay whatever you say honey). I mean why would you spend the night at someones house if it was just physical. It doesn't make sense. Despite his body he was a bad premature ejaculator. She said the sex was initially good (NRE if I had to guess) but it ended up becoming shorter and more painful. Her AP was also bad at giving oral (only way my wife orgasms and it's hard work believe me) and he was a bad kisser. He also was very rude and wouldn't get her something simple like water after sex. I called and talked the AP for a half and hour and he gave me a bag of half truths and lies. He said that my wife wanted him to put a baby in her (we've been trying for a baby for years with no luck.) She claims she never said that. She asked him not to use condoms. (Wife claims that's a lie and only offered not to use condoms for anal and period sex.) He also said she was fucking him because "" life is too short"". AP said he could never be with my wife because she is too outgoing and he could never date a cheater. He said he was also lying to her about another woman to keep her away and didn't want to be the cause of a divorce. My wife was pissed that he lied to her the other woman. While I believe some of what he said some of it I'm pretty sure he lied about . Because my wife showed me texts they had afterwards where he contradicted himself a bit and they ended on bad terms. The actually physical affair doesn't bother me too much. I told my wife before I would be open to a devil's three-way if she was open about it and shared all the messages with me. She refused saying that messages are too personal and that it wouldn't work out and we should be monogamous. ( I don't like being lied to and her talking to men behind my bad makes me feel like I am getting made fun of and judged) Oddly enough AP suggested a devil's threeway as well and she said I wouldn't have been into it. What gets me in the end is the following My wife's lying and manipulation during the affair. The AP going through with it knowing I was suicidal from just them talking. (He didn't know I was going to therapy) The way AP treated my wife (disrespectful and basically using her, knowing full well what she was sacrificing ) Knowing that years of me doing all kind of things for my wife. Everything short of dressing her, money management, dog care, errands, managing the household, cooking, and getting her whatever she wanted when she would ask for it. (I did this as a way to compensate for her making more money than me.) To know that a man can come out of no where and steal her away hurts so fucking bad. He didn't have to do anything to win her over besides have a good body. The sex stuff she would do with AP and not do for me. My wife showing more concern for APs health than my own on several occasions and even mocking my heart palpitations. AP lying to me and saying he wanted to be only friends with her when I confronted him when it was just text messages. AP came to my house (she said it was his idea,.AP said it was her idea so who knows) I'm the first LTR my wife has had who hasn't physically or mentally abusive or used her for money. In the aftermath my wife wants to go to therapy now (wanted to go after she started fucking AP). That's a positive. She's treated me the past month like she did she when we first started dating. She lost her job after being written up for more and more things after I found out. My therapist thinks it's related to her guilt. I've always been forgiving. I'm hanging in there in hopes therapy and a lesson learned will keep her from cheating again. I know it's a long shot and many on this subreddit in particular will think I am insane. However I am willing to give her a final opportunity to mature and learn from the past. I'm not afraid of losing her anymore. I would much prefer her in my life, however if she can't be faithful then I have no business being with her. I'll update from time to.time with updates for the.people who want to give their spouse a second chance after cheating. I'll be happy to answer any questions or clarifications y'all might have.",
160,"Just found out he (52) cheated on me (21)Hi, First time Poster asking for advice. We are together for 3 1/2 years (We met 1 Week after my 18 birthday) and live together for 1/12 years. I moved from my City to his. We both Have nice Jobs and are both financially indipendend. I work as an IT-Administrator and just found an hidden folder when I wanted to solve a Problem on his PC. In the Folder are Nudes of him and some other Guys fucking. The Pictures have Time Stamps from the last 2-3 Months When He was on vacation. Need advice what I should do. I somehow new It but he alsways denied it when I asked him. (He did some shady stuff before on his phone) Im somehow not as hurt as I thought I would. I´m not angry or sad. Just feel a bit lost. Monogamy was always a Important thing for me. But now that he cheated on me and I dont feel as bad as I whought I would. Does that mean I´m okay with an Open Relationship or does it mean I dont have any feelings lefft for him? He is currently at work and when he comes home I want to talk to him. Some advice would be needed. &#x200B; Thank you",
161,"I’m positive GF (30) Cheated on Me But She Won’t Admit it and it’s Eating Me Up. Trying to Reconcile, Need AdviceMy GF of almost two years blew up our relationship over Christmas by staying out all night, after she told me she’s be home around 1am from “girls night “. She showed up at my door at 9am with a hickey that she claims was from me, which of course is total bullshit. She claimed she lost her phone, hence she was unable to call me, and her girlfriend took her back to her place to sleep. This sounded like bullshit and could easily be cleared up with the gps history from her phone and the Uber recipient, both things she says exist but I still haven’t seen. I threw her out and didn’t talk to her for a week. After a solid week of no contact, feeling terrible and going through a whole host of emotions, I decided to call her. She came over under the pretense that we would lay everything on the table and she’d tell me everything that had been going on. Well she just sat there and lied to me, and I thought “well whatever, I love her, she’s been great for the last two years, let’s just move forward “ so I dropped it and we made up. Over the past month things have been great. We spend a lot of time together and we have a great time. But I just can’t get past the fact that she cheated, but more over the fact that I know she’s lying. The lying hurts more than anything. A couple weeks ago I asked her about the cheating. I was pissed and she kept telling me nothing happened. It turned into a huge fight and she admitted she was “texting with a guy months ago but nothing happened” then we reconciled again. So here I am, pissed and feeling betrayed. I still haven’t seen the gps history or the Uber recipient but I’ve stopped asking. I know it’s all garage because what woman that had been falsely accused of cheating not produce that stuff without even being asked? I keep thinking that she fucked up and we can move past it. I blame myself for this partially (even though I know I shouldn’t) and hope that we can work to make our relationship stronger. When were together we get along great. I just don’t understand but I do know that the lies are eating me up and almost six weeks later it still keeps me up almost every single night. I’m super disappointed in myself that I’ve let it go this far. I obviously love her and I’m obviously not thinking clearly. I’m thinking of telling her I need to see the gps history and the recipients or we are through. But I also feel like it’s been over a month and things have been good so maybe I should just let it go. Idk. Thank you for reading 🙂",
162,Fiancee cheated on me this summer. I get triggered but I also get aroused by the mind movies.Is this normal? I feel dumb when I have them and get sad but also turned on.,
163,"I (27F) just found out that my (28M) husband cheated on me with our friends wife - do I tell her husband what happened?Basically the title but there is a little backstory. My husband and I got married three years ago and I just found out he has been cheating on me with our college/close friends wife for about a year. After graduating University our friend group of 7 stayed in the city and would often see each other 2/3x a month. We all go to the same church and that's where this all started. He and I are over, already filing for divorce - I know that he has not told her or her husband and is trying to keep it under wraps. We are keeping the divorce proceedings to ourselves but our friends already have figured things are going downhill for us and we are splitting but do not know the reason. The girl that he cheated with recently married a year ago to a abusive prick - he does not deserve to be cheated on with but that does not excuse his actions. I am fairly close friends with her and have gotten to know her the past two years pretty well. She and my (exish)husband have stayed close because they sing in church together, lead church groups and occasionally hangout for coffee and stuff like that. I have heard from this girl about her abusive husband and how he treats her - its totally unacceptable and I am concerned for her safety when he does find out. From what I have heard from her and from what she has told our girl/friend group he puts holes in the walls when hes angry, abuses their dog, calls her names, is super controlling, has had many fights with her for hanging out with other men, penetrates her in her sleep and is just an asshole. On one hand its her life and I/our friend group have been telling her to divorce her husband for the pas six months but, ""she cant see her life without him,"" so she can figure stuff out on her own without me - cause its not my problem. On the other hand her husband should know that she was unfaithful as I know that would be a dealbreaker for him as he is a BibleThumper. But I am concerned for her safety - I know that this will be a lot worse and that he will hurt her if he finds out much after the fact. Do I tell him straight up? Do I do it anonymous? Or do I just walk away? Eventually it will all come out in their marriage but I am getting out of all of it anyways but am very concerned for her safety.",
164,"My boyfriend (18M) emotionally cheated on me (18F), broke up with me, and now really wants to be my friend.First time poster, but here we go. I've been dating him for 2 years now, and I thought everything was perfect. We never talked about the future much, but we were okay with that. He had female friends he would hang out with a lot, and I didn't mind because he's always only had female friends. He gets along better with them. I was a bit insecure because one of them he used to be in love with, but I trusted him, so I didn't let it bother me too much. Yesterday out of the blue he tells me that he's fallen out of love with me. I'm in shock. I go to hang out with the girl who he used to be in love with because she invited me over to comfort me (she's been a good friend of mine for a while). While there she told me that 3 days before he had broken up with me, he had told her he has feelings for her. I was mortified. I never would've seen it coming. It made her incredibly uncomfortable and he texted her an apology the next day (he slept in her living room that night, they would have sleepovers sometimes), and then 3 days later he ended things with me. When he broke up with me, he was sobbing. I have never seen this boy cry in the 2 years I've been with him, and he kept saying that he didn't want to lose me as a friend. Should I be friends with him? I don't know if that's what I want. Should I cut him off? Does anybody have any advice on how to navigate this?",

167,"My (34M) wife (32F) has sex addiction and cheated on me.\[I posted this in r/relationships, but was suggested to post it here\] I write this in tears because yesterday, my world collapsed. A little context: we have been together for 11 years, 5 married, and we had our difficulties like everybody else. Since our only daughter was born, 3 years ago, I gained weight and my self-esteem was down. It made me bitter and with bad moods, but I was working on losing that weight and caring for myself. My wife had postpartum depression and was seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist who medicated her. I’ve never asked what she talked with them, I waited her to share with me if she wanted. About a year ago, I found out she was texting and seeing an old crush of her. We had a crisis, but endured, because we still loved each other and I´m a firm believer of forgiveness. And that was that. Later came yesterday, damn day. I was suspicious something was going on and got into her Instagram account and quicky found out a conversation with a known married guy that was absolutely not appropriate. I kept reading the conversation as they were having it until it was clear that something happened between them. At night, I started a conversation but wasn´t frontal about it, trying to make her tell me without me asking. Boy, that was a bad idea. She started talking about what she talked with her psychologist and psychiatrist. They diagnosed her with sex addition. I mean, we had sex a lot, above average but I never suspected that was the case, I just felt “lucky”. The thing is, I was expecting her to confess about the guy in the conversation I saw. Man, was I wrong. She told me she lost control and confessed having sex with him, her old crush (a year ago), two guys from the gym (at the gym!, not at the same time), another acquaintance from her family, and some other guy. Three of these men are married. Not only that, but she exchanged nudes with other men via Instagram. Including guys I know, who are married too. All of this in the last weeks. So, my world came crushing down. Pain, excruciating pain: a wrecking ball hit me. I was in shock, didn’t know what to say or feel. She says she wants to be with me, fight for our family, but she is struggling with her condition: talking with her therapist and taking medication. I’m overwhelmed, I don’t know what to do. I don’t recognize her. I feel like a fool, physically sick. Do I burn the house down? Telling the wives of these men what they’ve done? They deserve to know, don’t they? But, on the other hand, her situation it’s a clinical condition. Can’t I blame her for that? Do I need to be there for her as I promised “on sickness and in health”? But it´s too damn hard! I need a hug. Note: Sorry for my writing, English is not my native language. **TL;DR:** Yesterday I found out my wife was diagnosed with sex addiction and has cheated on me several times the last weeks.",
169,"My long distance gf (21F) cheated on me (22M) a year ago. Yesterday she started an internship in a lab and that guy works there, tooHi reddit. My girlfriend and I have been together for more than 5 years. She lives about 2-3 driving hours away from me and we see each other every week. She studies at a university, while I work as a software developer and we're planning on moving together, when she finishes her studies, which will be in about 7 months. She has a fellow student X, who was part of a group she sometimes went to parties with. X apparently had a crush on her, because he would sometimes kiss her on the cheek or lay his arm around her shoulder and tell her that she's beautiful, which she didn't tell me at the time. I was already suspicious of X (that I have never met, what she told me was enough to make me suspicious) and then about 2 years ago, she told me about a party and how she, X and another girl were the last ones and walked around the city. Coincidentally I talked to that girl before and knew, she weren't there, so I confronted my gf about it. She started crying and admitted that they both were alone, broke in to a botanical garden and he kissed her there. She told me that she then retreated and they both went home separately and that they talked on the phone the next day and both agreed to not let that happen again. After that, she went to less parties and didn't have any contact with him, as far as I know. Then almost exactly 1 year ago, she cheated on me with X. After a party they both visited, at 4 am when she was already on her way home, he texted her some stuff about sleeping over at hers and she agreed. I even called her between them agreeing and him arriving, because I woke up and saw her text that she is home now and we talked for about 20 minutes and everything seemed normal. Shortly after that, X arrived, they had sex, he left a few hours later and she came visiting me just a few hours later. She stayed for a week (which is not unusual) and on the morning of her departure, just after waking up and just before she had to leave, she confessed to me, while crying. My first reaction was comforting her and telling her ""It will be alright"", ""We'll figure this out"", thanking her for her honesty and stuff like that. She told me, how a small part of her feels like it's missing out on something by being in a relationship, but how all the rest loves me crazy and doesn't want to lose me. After she left and I had a little time to let it sink in, I told her I needed some space and we had no contact for 3 days. After those passed, I drove to her and we talked about how to go on from there. She told me, how me being suspicious and showing jealousy made her feel restricted and I can understand that and have tried to improve since. She agreed on **never having contact with X again** and being fully honest and commited to the relationship. From that time on, we both worked together to improve our relationship and I can feel how it matures and how we both can talk about our feelings and understand each other, so that is great. However, this whole thing has sent me into a spiral of depressive phases. I think, it being almost exactly 1 year ago brings the whole thing back to my mind constantly. I can hardly cope with that at the moment and I am on a waiting list to see a therapist (again). I really think she now regrets cheating on me, because she sees what it has done to me and I somehow and most of the time trust her to not let anything like that happen again. It seems to me, she has underwent some sort of change in that past year and now is more mature and has more respect for my feelings. This, however, does not stop my mind from picturing what she has done and thinking about if there are other things that have happened, I am not yet aware of on a daily basis. You can probably imagine that this is exhausting and shattering. Why I am finally talking to someone about this whole thing now, is that she started a voluntary 2-month internship in a lab as part of her studies and X works there too, as one of her 5 peers. I really don't want them having any contact and she understands me and does not want to put me through this. Problem is, there is no easy way to quit the internship, because she had to apply and had an interview with the professor and was all enthusiastic, she got a key to the building and it has already cost money and time for the lab to get her the position. I imagine, it will hurt her reputation dropping out after the first day and I don't want that. I want her to succeed and have the opportunity to learn new things and meet new people. She has called in sick today on her second day, which will already hurt her reputation, to find a way out of the whole misery. I had to call in sick, too. I feel like I am the one in the relationship, who has to cut back and eventually gives in most of the time and I don't want to do that again here. And some part of me thinks, that this is now a deserved punishment for what she did. You see, I am torn. I don't know what to do here. Any advice on how I should react, short of dumping her, is greatly appreciated. &#x200B; TL;DR: My gf has a history with X and then cheats on me. We both agree on a plan to save the relationship, which includes not having any contact with X. She now started an internship, where he is one of her peers.",

172,4 MONTH TRANSFORMATION - My Girlfriend cheated on me with my bestfriend. I took out all of the pain in the gym and 4 months later I couldn’t be prouder of myself.,
173,"My (26f) wife cheated on me (34m) less than 3 months after we got married.My wife went out after work with some of her coworkers for one of their birthdays . They were drinking pretty heavily at a bar and I guess she met some guy at the bar and started talking to him for about an hour and ended up making out with him at the bar. I know this because she told me two days later. She said she was drunk and doesn’t remember much. Now I am stuck, I’m really sad we have a 3 y/o daughter together. I used to be a bit of a player and have dated a lot of women but this one I get along with and who’s company I enjoy more than any other woman I’ve been with and it’s not even close. On one had it seems dumb to end a marriage over a drunken kiss, but it’s never just that she says sometimes she feels trapped and wonders what her life would be like if she didn’t settle down so young. I have been saving and working nonstop since I was 14 I’ve never taken more than 10 days off work. I have managed to acquire a decent amount of assets for a man my age and now I feel pressured to divorce now because at this point she won’t get anything. Even if I want to work through this I don’t know if I can gamble with that any longer. She seems genuinely remorseful and has been doing the whole sad puppy routine. The icing on the cake is that she claims she doesn’t like to make out and we rarely kiss more than lightly but she’s going to mug down with a stranger? Our sex is a few times a week but I always initiate. I don’t feel desired, I know she loves me as a husband as a partner as a father to our kid. But as a lover? I’m having my doubts and I’m starting to ask myself if that’s true can it be fixed ? You can’t negotiate desire. And how is she ever going to stop wondering what she missed out on? I’m perfectly capable of finding someone who wants me on all levels not just some. I just don’t know if Kim ready to nuke our whole family yet.",

So the thing is he keeps saying he never cheated, because he never kissed someone or slept with them. &#x200B; But he has emotional affairs and it hurts me so so much more.... &#x200B; I used to stay in a different town and we would see each other weekends, during this time he constantly went on dates (took a girl to a bar like every other night) he has never taken me for a drink at a bar in the 2 years we have been together... it seems this girl actually left him because they have not spoken since June 2019, &#x200B; I found out about all of this because he logged onto whatsapp web on the laptop and forgot to log off. This was 30 October 2019 when I found out about everything, I had moved in with him a month before , on the 1st of September as I found a amazing job in the town he stays in. So I also helped him buy a motorcycle,i pay half the installment and he pays the other half... and he would use this BMW Bike to take the girls on dates and for rides. Like I actually paid to get cheated on. &#x200B; So besides the girl he went on dates with, a new girl started working at his job, he flirted with her on whatsapp every single day. In the mornings when i make him coffee, he would text her saying wish she was in bed with him. He would ask her if she wants to go ride on his motorcycle with him on saturdays. Constantly. Everyday. &#x200B; After i found out, i messaged her on facebook saying she can honestly have him. (he flirted with her and said sexual things , then she added me on facebook and would ""love"" all of our posts) &#x200B; She then has the audacity to message me back saying they are nothing more than colleagues. &#x200B; In the 3 months after I found out, things have been good sometimes, bad others and horrible most of the time. I cannot forgive him. This girl he works with still continues to like all his Facebook posts, [every.single.one](https://every.single.one) so I had feeling they are still talking and MADE him delete and block her on Facebook. &#x200B; I hate the fact that people think cheating is just sleeping together, the fact that he wanted to spend so much time with other women and leave me at home breaks my heart. &#x200B; And everytime i ask why did you do this to me? The answer is he does not know.. but he loves me. &#x200B; I am angry. I am sad. I am tired. I dont have family that I can talk to about this or move to, I have myself, and I really want to move out but everytime I try to look for a flat, he says please dont go, i changed. &#x200B; But i am unable to forgive someone for hurting me so bad. Especially since i never expected it. We were super happy (or atleast I was..) &#x200B; The fact that he would text this girl even after i fell asleep at nightt... or he would ignore me to talk to her... even if he did delete and block her, how can you do things like this and claim to love the other person. &#x200B; And how do you honestly heal after being stabbed in the back and lied to for a whole year.",

178,"Need advice. I (M24) walked out on girlfriend of 5 years (F24) as I think she cheated on me.I left because I found messages on her phone telling 2 of her friends about her behaviour on a works night out. First thing she told them was how she can't believe she was involved in a '4 way tongue kiss' Then went on to explain that she was in a group hug with 2 guys and another girl and they all touched their tongues together. The second thing she mentioned was how she couldn't stop flirting with another guy even saying 'I wrapped my arms around him and asked do you want to be my sugar daddy, but it's not your money I want' I also saw a picture of her with the guy and she had her arm round him and his hand was right at her lower hip. I was so angry and humiliated when I found this out. I pulled her up on it and she just balled her eyes out saying how sorry she was and begging me to stay but I just had to leave. It's been 4 weeks now and it's been brutal, especially over the holidays there and I miss her terribly. Would you guys consider what she done cheating? The thing is she works with these guys so she'll see them everyday and I'll need to consider that. Just didn't expect this, she really never seemed the type to act this way.",

180,"Just found out my wife cheated on me while we were engaged. We've been married for 1 yearHi Reddit. I need a place to vent and hopefully work out my feelings. I'm on mobile so please excuse any typos My wife and I were high school sweethearts and dated on and off through college and things were going really well in 2015. In May of 2016 I ask for her to Marry me and she accepts. She had just graduated college but about 3 weeks earlier her grandfather died. Ffw 3 weeks post engagement she tells me she "" needs time"" to get over the passing of her grandfather. I thought this was strange because I was her rock and was there for her through every bit of it. I assumed she meant she wanted to spend time with friend and family. Ffw another month and she says she's talking to someone else. This crushed me because she still had the engagement ring so I thought she still loved me and we'd be getting back together soon. She ended up coming back to me in fall 2016 and saying how sorry she was and begged for me to take her back. I did without hesitation. Ffw to last week when I looked through some old messages from summer of 2016 and saw that shed been screwing other guys the whole time. This brought back my depression and I honestly dont know if I love her anymore, i cant look at her without grimacing from the pain. I brought it back up and she was immediately defensive about the subject, and claimed that I knew about this. I honestly didnt, and never would've thought she would do this to me then beg for me to take her back. I really didnt know who I was marrying I feel like I've been betrayed and idk how I'll ever get over this feeling. This year of marriage has been good. But i am so unsure about the future. What happens when another loved one dies? What will she do then? Why did she leave me, lie about it, and come back to me? Idk what to do. Thanks for reading",
181,"Checked my ex girlfriend who cheated on me's Instagram after 2 weeks and now I hate myself.I made the greatest mistake ever..... checking my ex's instagram 2 weeks after our breakup. She's living her life partying, going to these events with mutual friends, all that stuff. I made a lot of progress mentally and I feel like all that has been peeled back a bit. Either way, it doesn't change the fact she cheated. I feel sad again.",
182,"My boyfriend (19M) cheated on me (18F) so I fucked his alpha male brother as revenge (21M)okay, so i really really like reading this subreddit and have for a while, but i never really had a story to post until now! i had to create a throwaway. Eric (19M) and i (18F) had dated for over three years, starting our junior year of high school. Everything was great, and we were so in sync that i really thought he was going to be my husband one day. Now i feel stupid for even entertaining that thought :( but you just have to understand how much i loved him back then. everything changed when we both graduated and went to college. we ended up having to move in with eric’s older brother, Jared. now i could never tell eric this, but i always found Jared REALLY hot. like, bend me over and cream pie me right here daddy levels of hot. this guy looked just like eric with dirty blonde hair and deep blue eyes except he was taller, tanner, more muscular, and kind of better than eric at almost every thing. jared knew all of this, and was the prime example of an alpha male douche about it. he never let eric live it down, constantly teasing him and making fun of his grades. he would always ask how eric “managed to find such a hot piece of ass” like me to date a loser like him. he would smack my ass when i walked by, and whenever eric protested, he would ask “what are you going to do about it?” i would defend eric sometimes, of course, but it honestly really, REALLY turned me on. knowing that another hotter version of eric thought of me like that and was living in the same house...it was really exciting okay!!! sometimes, i could even hear him bring girls home late at night and would listen to them moan as he pounded them. i wanted them to be me so bad sometimes. more and more often, when i masturbated i was thinking of Jared. so when eric fucked up everything, i knew what i had to do. Eric has said before we moved in that he really wanted to join a fraternity, and i argued against it for a bit, but eventually gave up. Eric had always been shy and quiet and i didn’t think it wasn’t a good fit for him. well i guess it fit him a little too well. he fucked some drunk slut at a party only a week into the semester. i was fucking furious when he told, screaming and crying, but he begged and begged and begged so i eventually took him back. it’s really mean of me, but i still wanted to get back at him, and i knew just how to do it. i told him it was only fair that if he got to fuck someone, i would too. i think you see where this is going. well, eric agreed and i told him the only condition was that i wouldn’t tell him who it was. he was a little whiny about this but i reminded him it was his fuck up that did this and he shut up. the deal was going to be that i fuck one guy, and he’ll never know who or when. of course i already knew the answers to both of those questions. i knew jared always came in late from partying on saturdays, so when i heard the door open, i pretended to get up to go get a water. as i walked into the living room, with only a tiny sleep shirt and pink thong on with no bra, jared noticed me immediately. he looked surprised. he smiled and asked me if i had “finally decided to upgrade to the deluxe brother.” i rolled my eyes and tried to shoot something about just needing to get water back, but to tell the truth my heart was beating so fast and i was so wet at the though of him it probably came out stupid. he was blocking the way to the kitchen, so i had to move past him. as i did, he smacked my ass like i was so used to, but this time i accidentally let out a little moan as he did it. he laughed and called me a slut, which made me even wetter. he pushed me back (fuck) and growled in my ear (ffffFUCK so hot). “Don’t lie to me, i heard about that loser cheating on you.” i tried to mumble something back, but his hand was down my thong already. as his hand rubbed my clit, all that came out of my mouth were moans. i was HIS after that, fuck i was so wet. i ended up on my knees right there in the kitchen, sucking his perfect, and MUCH bigger than eric’s, cock. it tasted like pussy already, so i know he had been fucking some girl at the party earlier. fuck, it made me want to be used just like her i don’t know how long we actually fucked, but i do know that it felt SO much better than anything Eric had ever done for me...his cock filled me all while he whispered how a good little slut like me deserved better than his loser brother. he even pinned me against eric’s door and told me he wanted him to hear us. guys, i moaned SO fucking loud while he pounded me eric had to have heard us. eventually i think we were rattling his door lol i still haven’t talked to eric about it, but i’ve been spending more and more nights in his brother’s room, and every night i moan a little bit louder. Tommorow, i’m planning on letting him fuck my ass. eric and i never did anal but...i guess things change when you upgrade ;)",

184,"Found out girlfriend(23F) cheated on me(23M)... Stuck on the cruise with her for 3 more daysEdit: can't strike through from my phone I think. I left her last second on a tour inside Mexico. I tried to get a new room but they said there's nothing left for me, even with money. I'm still stuck in this room with her when she gets back. And no I'm not kicking her out of it lol So I found this out today... Sorry for any grammar typos since this is typed from my phone. Here's a little background. We met in college in California, dated very happily for 1.5 years until she decided to quit school and become a flight attendant. Now I did a lot of research an talked to a lot of people about her career, many of them were warnings. I still decided to support her through her transition when none of her family did. We've been having some problems recently because of our wild schedules but we were every much together and going on mini vacations each month. Fast forward a year till today. After many guilty faces and backing away when I was getting close, along with other signs, I checked her phone (for the first time in out relationship) and saw the heart dropping dirty talk. He was some military guy who became a flight attendant. I confronted her and she confessed everything. What sucks on top of getting cheated on is that this girl was the most ethical and moral person I've ever met. She puts everyone ahead of herself and has always been that way. If a girl like this is capable of cheating then who can I trust? Also, yeah I'm stuck in the same room and bed with her for 3 more days... I also have the flight back with her afterwards as well. Looking forward to that lol... What's the best way to move past this and stay confident while not be paranoid at every corner? Edit: I prefer the advice on healing rather than what to do with her. I don't think dumping will be helpful as the relationship is over. Edit 2: I'm not getting back either. That much is sure. Tldr: My girlfriend of 2.5 years cheated on me since a month ago (at least twice). I found out after checking her phone (for the first time)when her messages were suspicious and found the dirty talk under loads of meme-related cover-up (actually made it extra suspicious). I confronted her about it and she confessed everything. I'm stuck with her in the same bed and room, for 3 more days, not to mention the flight home.",

189,"I(18M) have been getting texts from my gf’s(17F) friends saying that shes cheated on me, been raped, and had chlamydia. I’m at the point where I really dont know who to believe or what to. Getting those texts makes me die inside and idk what to do. I dont feel happy anymore, especially now. plz helpWe’ve been together for two years this month. The first month of the relationship was truly “picture perfect,” but on the day of our one month anniversary, the entire dynamic of the relationship changed. I got a snap from her ex saying that she cheated on me during the first couple weeks, he had proof, and so naturally i asked her about it. At the time I was so stupidly blinded by love, that I didn’t really care about what she had done, and wanted to stay with her. Her on the other hand, wanted to end things right there, saying stuff like: “I wouldn’t want to hurt you again, you’re too good of a guy, we shouldn’t get back together, etc.” It came down to me begging for her back (I know right, She cheated on me, and I had to beg for her back). later when I asked her if she was ever going to tell me, she replied with something along the lines of: “I wasn’t planning on telling you, just hoping you’d never find out.” We(I) eventually forgave and forgot, deciding that we could move on and that “everybody deserves a second chance” So fast forward a few months, to around late October/early November of 2018, she had moved schools (we already had been going to different schools, but now she moved to a new school a little bit farther away) I could still see her pretty often, so the school change wouldn’t affect much, or so I thought. She had eventually mentioned another guy, we’ll call him Ben, and looking back, I should’ve left then and there. I had already been worried about her cheating again, because yanno once you get cheated on there’s never any going back to normal. Anyways to make a long story short, one week, towards the beginning of the week, she had told me that she’s not happy, doesn’t think we’re gonna work out, all that good stuff. She wanted a break. But me being blinded by the love and the fact that she never gave me a good reason for wanted the break, had to comply. It was hard for me. Going from talking about everything every day to the same someone, and then just turning off like a switch, was absolutely difficult for me. I kept trying to text her, even though we were on “break”. So in the midst of the break, she tried to fully break up with me, but without making it clear (at least is wasn’t clear to me, at all). So I was still under the impression that we were going steady, just not talking, on break, because she wanted space. Well, that Saturday of the same week I had to work. She had previously mentioned going over to Ben’s house with some other friends, and when she first brought it up, I made it very clear that I wasn’t comfortable with it. She basically told me that I wasn’t her dad and that I can’t control what she does and doesn’t do. She also told me that I could trust her and shouldn’t worry about her fucking another guy. So Saturday rolls around, and I’m at work doing my thing, and she tells me that she was gonna go there and meet her friends there. I think “alright what’s the worst thing that could happen?” Well haha she slept with him that day. There were no other friends there with them, just Ben and her. Since we were still taking a break, or at least I thought it was a break, we weren’t planning on hanging out that night. So when she had asked to hang out with me that night, it should’ve raised some red flags. We go back to my house and have sex, and after she tells me that she slept with him. I just remember the feeling of betrayal and disgust that came over me. I immediately got dressed and took her home. The next morning I got scared of being alone and she convinced me to take her back. I don’t know why I did, but I took her back. Fast forward to the next summer, after I graduated high school. We wake up in the morning and as I’m making coffee she runs into the kitchen yelling at me for texting another girl. For the last semester of high school, I had been texting a girl that liked me, and I’m going to lie, I felt a connection with her. we had been in school together for 6 years and just were good friends. After the whole Ben incident, it felt good to confide in someone, since I felt couldn’t talk to my girlfriend about how I felt. It was more of me ranting about our relationship problems, and nothing more than that. I never cheated, kissed, hugged, slept with, etc. with the girl, and it was never anything more than me confiding in her. So when my girlfriend found the messages, she wasn’t too happy about it and almost broke up with me (she still hasn’t let to down and forgave and forgot to this day). So that ruined her trust of me, and let me tell you, imo it’s all gone down hill from there. Since I’ve started college last August, there’s been constant breakups, because she doesn’t trust me around college girls. Countless amounts of fights, more breakups than I could count. (each usually not lasting more than 12 hours). I’ve felt so broken apart about this whole thing, for a majority of the month of December 2019 I was completely “unplugged” from the relationship, talking to her in a minimalist way and showing a disinterest in wanting to hang out. About the same time some of her friends had texted me telling me she’s cheated, she was raped and got chlamydia, not to believe her, etc. Not to mention the things I’ve found on her phone. To give a few examples: Of one of the times we broke up, though it was only for a single night, she texted another guy wanting him to “come cuddle,” another was on new year’s day when I looked on her snapchat and found messages from her to another guy saying “come fuck me, i want you” Those are just a few examples. Now she swears that I’m all she wants, there’s no other guys, and that if she wanted someone else, she’d leave me. BTW, every. single. time. we argue she throws in my face “there’s hundreds of other guys trying to be with me,” and it’s got to the point where whenever she says those types of things, I say “then leave and go give them a chance.” I’m sure I’m missing something, but I thank everyone who read all of it, sorry I know it’s long, but I can’t talk to anyone now, she’s isolated me from all of my old friends, doesn’t allow me to be on snapchat, banned me from having tik tok on my phone, and makes me block every single female that I come into contact with on my phone (even my female cousins). I don’t know what to do, I would feel really shitty if I were to end the relationship, because most times I’ve tried to in the past and been serious about it, she threatens to kill herself, because “life isn’t worth living without me.” At the same time, it feels like more times than not, I’m not happy in the relationship. Again I’m sorry for the long post, a true thank you to those who read it all. Any advice would be appreciated more than you think",
190,"Girlfriend cheated on me for year?My girlfriend kept on cheating with me for year. I never asked her much about where she is and stuff because I trusted her fully. She kept on cheating on me with other guy and told her friends I was just a friend. I am very introverted and don't trust people much. So this has left me completely broken and I don't know how to carry on. I have zero confidence in myself now. I hate myself for being so naive. And worse of all she doesn't even feel any remorse. I want to hurt her somehow (not physically). And the guy she cheated with doesn't know that I have her Boyfriend, she told him I was just a friend. Should I tell him about us? I am soo lonely and tired and heartbroken. This is a person I loved more then anything. Yes our relationship was not going well , we fought a lot. But still ... I know about all this after breaking up with her a week ago. What should I do? EDIT: This is a follow up . So I called the other guy to tell him about all this. But he is not picking up , I tried with a frnds phn still no answer. So I just left him a message, ""..I don't know what she has told you, I think you deserve to know the whole truth. She was in a relationship with me as well. If you want to talk more call me. I wouldn't really care even if u don't call . "". I don't know if that was the right thing to do.

191,"My wife (F30) told me that she cheated on me (M28) and I honestly don't know what to doWe have been married for over 5 and a half years. I love her so much. We finally got our own place on December 2018 and things were looking up for us. These 5 years were so magical and I always told myself that through all of our trials in life, that I would marry her again. This past Tuesday, my lead told us that we can VTO (Volunteer Time Off. I work night shift) So my co worker gave me a ride home. (My wife and I share a car). When he dropped me off, I noticed that our car wasn't parked in our parking spot. I thought that she parked somewhere else. As soon as I went inside, I went to our bedroom so that I can kiss her and surprise her and let her know that I am home. The plan was to make her breakfast before she woke up to go to work. She wasn't in the room. She wasn't home. So I called her and asked her where she was. When she answered, she sound like she just woke up. My heart broke because I had a feeling of what was going on. She made an excuse that she was at the store to get balloons for co-worker's birthday. I gave her the benefit of the doubt. So I was in bed and she finally got home after 30 minutes of waiting. She sat on the bed and I asked her if she was okay. She wouldn't answer and began to cry. Then after 5 minutes of asking of what's going on, she told me that she cheated on me. She said that she went out and talked to someone, got drunk and it just happened. I am sad. I honestly thought this would never happen to me. I don't know what to do. We had a long talk about our marriage and what we would do. We agreed that we would try to work it out, but at this time, 9/6 at 0545, I am strongly considering in divorcing her. I can't even look at her anymore. The thought of hugging her, kissing her, touching her makes me sick to my stomach. She wants to work it out, but my heart isn't in it anymore. What should I do? Am I overreacting? I honestly thought of killing myself. I am so sad. She was my everything. TLDR; Wife confessed to cheating. I am so sad. Thinking of killing myself. What do I do? &#x200B; Thank you &#x200B; Edit to say: Just got back from my long ass walk since posting this (0500 pst) I am so surprised for the support! <3 Thanks to all that replied to me with your advice. I still love her and ultimately, even though it is tough for me, I forgive her. Time will heal this pain and honestly, I love her too much to end this. We have been through so much and have so many wonderful memories. I honestly can't imagine being with another person. She is truly sorry that she cheated on me. Most wont agree with this, but I will give her another chance and see where this goes. And no, I wont kill myself. I promise. I really appreciate your concerns and replies. It makes me happy that you all took time out of your busy lives to reply to me. Take care everyone and I'll update as time goes on.. <3 &#x200B; \*\*\*UPDATE 09/13:\*\*\* I have been reading the comments. I understand that to most it is stupid that I am still with her. I understand. Trust me. We have been talking a lot. She is truly sorry and I forgive her. I put her mistake behind me and I am looking forward in fixing our marriage. We plan on going to therapy soon so that we can talk it out. The reason why we haven't gone yet is because we have to work because there are bills that we are paying off (We will be debt free by the end of 2019.) but we will go sometimes next week. &#x200B; We are working this out. We are still living together. We are communicating more and more about what we need to do to improve our marriage and love life. Honestly, it has been going well. Things are looking up because soon, I will be transferring to Day shift so that I can spend time with her, sleep with her and have the normal schedule that I have been longing for. I still want her in my life and I don't see divorce. We will work this out. Again, Thank you all for helping me in my time of need. I am really grateful that you all took the time in giving me advice. It helps. Ill update as time goes on. <3",
192,"How do I (23 F) work through what I said to my ex boyfriend (25 M) when he told me he cheated on me....with my sister?To begin; I’m notorious for being pretty cold and sharp, but only when confronted or treated poorly. Also, this happened over a year ago. I just keep thinking about it. My boyfriend at the time had been with me for three years. He’s a writer who has applied to more MFA programs than anyone can count, but I always supported his dreams and ambitions the best I could. I really had faith that one day he’d land a spot. While trying to get into these programs, he worked as a fry cook at a local diner. He absolutely hated his job and every day talked about quitting and how he felt like he was wasting his time / talent. One night we got wine drunk together on my back deck and we were just listening to music when he started crying. I asked what was up and he tearfully confessed that several months prior, he’d fucked my sister. Three times. He apologized and said over and over what a huge mistake he’d made, but I was stunned into absolute silence. When I found my voice all I could think to say was “okay. In a minute, I want you to go inside and get your shit. But right now I have something to say.” He was still crying / talking over me / begging for my forgiveness but he shut up long enough for me to continue, and I responded with something to the general effect of “You’re a mediocre writer. I’ve been waiting to admit that to you, but as your girlfriend, I wanted to support you. In truth you’ll never get in anywhere, and your career will amount to absolute shit. I hope that’s just how life is for you. Writing mediocre poetry in your mediocre apartment, working as a fry cook until you die from something typical and uneventful— a heart attack, maybe. You’re a waste of a person. Now get your shit, and get the fuck out of my house.” He made some excuses about not wanting to drive drunk and wanting to just crash on the couch. He was full blown sobbing at this point. I said I didn’t give a fuck how he left, as long as he did. He ordered an Uber and was gone. I blocked him on everything and that was the only “closure” either of us got. I know I was drunk, but that’s not an excuse. I was exceptionally cruel and classist. In that moment my sole goal was to crush him completely so he’d be brought down to my level. I wouldn’t ever say something like that again, but honestly...I can’t say I regret it. People always tell you you’ll regret cruelty, and usually that’s true, but it felt like a horribly toxic version of “taking my power back” and it was the only thing that made me feel remotely better / in control for the moment. I know what I said gutted him. I picked the exact, specific thing I knew would hurt him most and ran with it. I guess I’m just venting. My relationship with my sister is also completely totaled thanks to this, and while I do blame them both, my fury at him over the loss of that relationship has further fueled my nonsensical feeling of justification when it comes to my actions. Anyway, how do I force myself to regret this? How do I stop turning it over in my brain? TLDR: I trashed my boyfriend’s career, character and livelihood when he confessed to cheating. I don’t feel bad about it, but think that I *should* feel guilty. How do I stop turning this situation over in my brain and move on?",

In a span of a month : He called her beautiful multiple times She called him handsome Hugged Gone out to lunch just the two of them multiple times He’s bought her a breakfast smoothie to surprise her He’s even put on cologne for her to work, he only ever used it for our dates before He’s also deleted any messages they’ve had And she’s asked him out to the movies He said he thought he liked her but that he actually doesn’t and that it was all just in his head Though I do know that she does like him Am I wrong to ask him to not talk to her anymore? I am not comfortable with them talking if it isn’t strictly just work related. We’ve been dating for 4 years now I am 24f and he is 25m. Co worker is 33",
194,"Me (30m) My girlfriend (27F) of 6 years cheated on meI was in a good, stable relationship for 6 years, we just went away and had an amazing time, we'd spoken about the idea of marriage, children etc. She never gave me any reason to distrust her before. But when I got back from a trip away with a friend, she confessed she'd kissed and 'fumbled around' with a guy from her work. This guy has been sniffing around her for months, probably 6+ months. The first time I met him, he said something to her that I thought was dodgy, but only I and someone else heard it, something like 'you're amazing'. I didn't think much to it as he was plastered. So the coming months they get really close as 'friends', she talks about him all the time, saying how funny he is, but also saying how weird looking he is and how he can't get a girlfriend because he's 'a bit weird', things like that (he is weird looking...). They go out drinking together with others as colleagues, but it always seems to be them the last out. She even brought him back to stay in our spare room a few times. Once I opened the door to see her naked from the bottom down, getting clothes off the drying rack in the spare room and he peeped his head from behind the door. She claimed that was an accident and she pulled her top down to cover everything and just needed to get something. I was pretty angry about this, because I wouldn't dream of doing something like that and expect to get away with it. They continue the same though, going out for dinner, I brought it up that I thought it was inappropriate and she accused me of not letting her have male friends (which isn't true, but this felt creepy to me). I suspected he was trying to drive a wedge between us and was being opportunistic. I even thought 'at some point she's going to come home and tell me he tried it on and she'll know I was right'. Then that did happen, but she was so drunk, that for whatever reason she went along with it. She claims not to remember anything about it, or any of what happened after (so I don't know if it really ended there), only that she went home shortly after (so this happened in the streets somewhere, classy...). Whilst she's never given me any reason to distrust her before, I feel like this chain of events is actually so fucked up looking back that I don't think I should forgive her. She's really upset, she feels awful and she isn't a bad person, she's clearly got a drinking problem and has said she would quit for good. But I just don't believe a word she says anymore. I think the most difficult part is she can't tell me why she did it, she can't remember what was going through her head, I don't know if she's being genuine or she's not telling me something. She also claims she feels sick at the thought of it and doesn't like him at all. Which is even more of a mystery. We always told each other that if one of us cheated, that would be it, I was really clear about that. So she does, with someone she doesn't even like. I'd understand if she had an office crush on him that spilled over. I've never cheated on her, I've been in situations where I could have done, and I left those situations because I felt it wasn't appropriate to be there anymore. I get the impression some people think I'm overreacting, or that it's just a 'blip', but a relationship shouldn't be made up of blips where you fundamentally shatter the trust of the other person. Am I overreacting? Was the precursor to the 'main event' creep AF? Thoughts appreciated, I could kill him and never see her again happily as it is.",

198,"HELP my (24M) girlfriend (22F) 5 years cheated on me while abroad and made the guy tattoo herWe have been together for 5.5 years. She was 17 and I was 19. We had a great start. After a 2 years she started with Uni and developed a anxiety disorder. It took a lot of fun from our relationship, but I always gave her everything I had to offer. An important part of this story is that I was here first kiss and everything else. Back in June this year she was offered a trainee in South-America or 3 months. She told me she liked the idea but was scared she couldn't keep it together. So I sat down and I explained to her that it is a once in a livetime experience and that a new enviroment might help her from getting out of the dark clouds in her head. So she did. She left on august 28 and the first 6 weeks were tough for her. I called her everyday and I didn't always really care about she was doing because I was busy with my own daily routine. But everytime there was a problem I was there for here on the phone. Suddenly the 7th or 8th week a complete change happened. Her trainee did go really well, she was feeling more independent and lost like 10KG's. She was changing into the girl I fell in love with again. But... she really didn't care about me anymore. We argued alot and I told her she can't pull on me that much for 2 months but when you feel good you don't even look back to me. It really hurts me because I dealt with every crazy moodswing of her and sometimes impossible behaviour. We had the craziest fights on the phone and I told her I needed her but she told me things like : ""I can finally enjoy life, let me be here. I'll be back in just 4 weeks."" I can understand that but with every day passed she treated me more like a pile of dirt. My guts told me something was off. She came back on the 1st of december. The arguments got so bad while she was there so I decided I was not going to pick her up from the airport along with her family. She came to me instead after dropping her luggage. I fell in love so hard because I got my girl back but in the most healthy way. She looked stunning and didn't let any fears trouble her mind. She also had a really nice tattoo really high in her thigh. A lotus flower resembling growth from darkness. But as I told... my guts told me something was off. She told me it was my own fault she treated me like that. I never made her feel like she was beautiful or I was just a boring prick were things she told me. So, this morning I woke up and I checked her phone. She cheated on me with the tattoo artist. 4 times, unprotected. She broke down and told me its mainly because I am her first love she was really curious what it could me like with someone else. And after feeling ugly after so many years she felt beautifull and happy again and the guy made her feel good. She says she's really sorry and she feels stupid. She says it was part of the youth she never had. Listen guys this girl I love her to death. I've been through al the bad shit just for her. I get her back a the woman I always wanted her to be. But she treated me like shit for a month, acted like it was my fault while she was cheating on me and fell in love with that prick. I really want to forgive her and I can for cheating on me, I understand that having just one partner for all your life makes you question things. But she treated me like shit for over a month. And the tattoo..... I have to look at that thing for the rest of my life.. She says it's not because she liked the guy but because its for her own blooming period. She says she can separate the tattoo from the guy but I can't. She says she will do anything for me and she doesn't want to lose me. She feels like kinda deserved to feel like how it could be with someone else. She now knows it wasn't worth it. I've been a reader of this sub for 2 years and I never expected to ask this.. but can I please have ya'll opinion and advice on this one please? (TLDR) My gf went on a trainee overboard for 3 months and cheated on me. I had to find out by strange behaviour she blamed me for and found the conclusion in her phone. The guy she cheated on is also a tattoo artist and gave her a tattoo really high on her thigh. She tells me it's because she always felt ugly and started to shine and she never had anyone else besides me. Idk wtf to do.",
199,"I found out my boyfriend cheated on me and lied about a bunch of stuff lolHe decided it was smart to flirt and fuck with another girl while we were dating and is now trying to convince me that I should get back together with him because he had learned so much and could finally “treat me right”.

200,"I [32M] sfound out my wife [30/F] is having affair, and she doesn’t know I know.[***UPDATED POST***](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d36pwo/update_i_32m_found_out_my_wife_30f_is_having_an/) Edit: I have words for things now that I didn't before.I threw around the word ""narcissist"" without really knowing what it means. After reading *Becoming the Narcissist's Nightmare* by Shahida Arabi, I am fully aware that she is a narcissist. Ready to go down this rabbit hole? Good. Because I've been waking up at 3am to read it without consequence from my abusive partner. People have asked me why I did not get out sooner, or why I didn't realize she was not a good mom sooner, even judging me; saying my emotions were getting in the way of seeing her motherhood. Well, here are some answers to that. I had/have something called Trauma Brain, and it started from childhood. My mother was extremely emotionally manipulative and a narcissist herself... she would be overly controlling and critical, throwing in overt and covert put downs and cruel verbal abuse, in addition to attempting to control everything I did. ""You don't have it as bad as I did, you wimp."" ""You could be so much better than you are if you worked as hard as I do"" ""You're going to that crazy school where they teach you the wrong things. Come home and stop letting them poison you."" From the book: ""For those who have been abused as children by narcissistic parents, trauma literally changes the structure of a child's developing brain which is extremely malleable during that time. Dr. Martin Teicher (2006) pointed out the growing evidence that verbal abuse in childhood can change the way a brain is wired... There has been corresponding research that confirms that parental verbal aggression can in fact lead to changes in the brain."" (pg 160) Also from the book: ""For those of us who have experienced narcissitic abuse since childhood, many of us are familiar with the trauma bonds that can keep us locked in the vicious cycle of meeting and mating with narcissists."" (11) That second quote is the first line of the introduction. I was hooked. There are biochemical bonds that are formed, especially in children, with victims to abusive people. ""When trauma survivors encounter stimuli that remind them of their trauma... the amygdala (which processes emotions) reacts as if they are experiencing the same event."" (163) In fact, the biochemical bond is so strong it can even affect memory in a phenomenon called ""abuse amnesia"". The reason that I can't always remember exactly what hurtful things my partner said to me is because my brain literally programmed it out. The chemicals my brain associated with my partner were: Oxytocin, Dopamine, Cortisol, Adrenaline Norepiephrine, and Serotonin. You may have heard of some of these: Oxy, the ""feel good"" drug, the drug labeled ""Dope"" - the drug that rewards us for certain behaviors, Cortisol, the stress hormone, adrenaline and norepinephrine as the ""fight or flight"" hormones, and serotonin is the mood regulator. With an abusive partner, these rise and fall at any given moment. This leads to what is called a ""Trauma Bond"" - the result of intense emotional experiences that happen with our abusers. (162-175) Abused people are basically kept strung out on certain types of drugs and hormones for their entire relationship. My abuser has never ever had to show her true self because with narcissists, there is no true self. They rely on masks and fake emotions to get their way in any situation. ""What abuse, Throwaway? It can't really be that bad."" There is a cycle of narcissistic abuse, and it all starts with Trauma Bonding. The cycle is Idealize, Devalue, Discard, Destroy, Hoover. The Trauma bonds are located in the entire cycle, see if you can spot them. Idealize means your partner fawns over you, often called ""love-bombing"". It's a honeymoon period with occasional insights into their narcissistic nature that good people often chalk up to human error. See, the narcissist only looks for targets who are prime candidates for emotional manipulation. My wife and I dated for three months before we decided to get married. She also made us having sex extremely frequent and completely mind-blowing, as that was something I hadn't experienced before and (we'll get to this later) she had a LOT of practice. This idealization also causes most normal people to open up and be vulnerable with their partner, but this is just fuel for the narcissist's next phase: Devalue means that they will begin to pick on your insecurities, hopes and dreams, and character. Once you're ""hooked"" on the Dopamine and the Oxytocin, everything is exploitable. The narcissist will employ covert and overt strategies of putting you down and making you feel worthless. I experience this with harsh ""jokes"" - ""My husband is such an idiot he forgot to unplug the coffee machine. He probably needed more coffee!"" Oh, yeah, this happens in public too. I also got overt put-downs. ""You wouldn't have lost the tickets if you weren't so stupid. You can't focus on anything, you need to get your shit together."" ""Why don't you ever think about me? You're so selfish."" She also attacks my support networks, calling my friend my ""butt-buddy"", and bombing my phone with text messages whenever I'm at his house (once a week to gather with friends and hang out). -Even typing that made my cortisol rise, thinking about how my self-care could be interpreted as selfishness when it is NOT. Your value plummets, setting you up for the next phase: Discard is when the partner throws you to the curb, literally or figuratively. There is a moment when the narcissist gets tired of the ""supply"" (The attention an admiration of their ""trophies""... we say trophies because the narcissist only views people as objects that are extensions of themselves, like a purse or umbrella), and when the narcissist is tired of the supply, it will move on to a new one. In my relationship this looks like ""I'm done with you."" followed by excessive doting on our kids (her new supply). However, she gets worn out with them even faster, because while I can hide my emotions, the kids cannot. The other day one of the boys accidentally kneed the older one in the nose, and he started crying. She told him he has an ugly cry, and then he cried harder because he was called ugly and then my wife said ""What? I didn't say you were ugly, I said you had an ugly cry"". I cradled him in my arms and told him mommy didn't mean it. She dismissed us all and went to go chat with her boy toy in her bed. Her favorite words, each and every day, are ""I'm done!"" Then she emotionally abandons us, sometimes for days on end. This is another element of trauma, and this is what I'm worried about for our kids. What happens when this is the norm when I'm not there, and I can't help organize the pieces when trauma happens... I say pieces because trauma is literally a fracturing of the brain. Oh yeah, did I mention that I've been relegated to sleep in the guest bedroom... because I went and helped a friend with a woodworking project after the kids were asleep? Then, destroy. The narcissist will use their posse to destroy the character of the abused person, making it seem like they are the crazy person. Fortunately, in my situation, I have the support network where she does not yet. It takes time for her to establish, and she hasn't had enough of that yet. So, it's only 2-3 people right now. Then, the most significant piece for me, ""hoovering"". ""This is when the narcissist, like a hoover vacuum, attempts to suck you back in to the traumatic vortex of the relationship. Usually this occurs when the narcissist loses control of the victim and wants to regain control at the very moment the victim attempts to move forward with his or her life."" (51) I'll update the post with the way she tries to hoover back in after she's served. In the past, it's been with sex. After the conference, she had sex with me every night for a week. Probably because she'd already hooked up with her current fling. I had no idea. Now, what specific elements of abuse are we looking at? Buckle up folks because it's about to get very real for some of you. If your partner exhibits one or two of these, it may be NPD, or it may be something else. But if they exhibit 7, 8, or 9... Then DM me and we can talk about how the book says you can get out of that abusive relationship. Toxic and abusive behaviors exhibited by someone with Narcissistic Personality Disorder: 1. Being overly critical and controlling towards their partners, covertly and overtly putting them down through cruel verbal abuse - name calling, harsh insults disguised as jokes, contemptuous remarks about victim's appearance, lifestyle, line of work, or support networks. 2. Being physically and/or sexually abusive - coercing into sexual situations you aren't comfortable with, or even threatening to leave or ruin the victim's life if they do not comply with their wishes. 3. Engaging in Hot/Cold behavior (alternating through different hormones and drugs). This is the cycle of idealize, devalue, discard. They love you completely or they hate you. 4. Controlling every aspect of the partner's life - isolate the partner from family and friends and sabotage important life events or goals and aspirations. 5. Stonewalling into silence: any concerns about the relationship are met with silent treatment, ""I'm done"", or disappearance. 6. Triangulating Victims with other love interests, comparing the victim to previous lovers and relationships. 7. Gaslighting - diminishing the abuse so that it doesn't feel real, deflecting accountability. 8. Smear Campaings - Slander the victim's character and reputation so that the abuse victim is left with no support network. They project their own bad behavior onto the victim. 9. Blameshifting - projection of malignant traits onto the victim so that they seem like the crazy person, and the aggressor appears just fine. That's all her to a T. So, there you go. That's why I think she's an unfit mother and that's why it was so hard to realize I needed to leave. I had set a boundary (don't fuck other guys) and when she broke it, I realized all the other stuff that was off. Narcissists don't have boundaries, and kids need boundaries, among all the other crazy emotional abuse they'll be subjected to with her. UPDATE: This week has been exhausting. I went to visit three lawyers and contracted with one. The papers are being worked on. It will take at least 24 hours to process, then they'll talk with me about a plan to serve her. You might be wondering how I secured a lawyer. Well, I had not really had ties with my family. My dad and her are always at odds, and after one time that he didn't follow one of her rules with one of the boys, she lost it at him. She convinced me he was the toxic one and that he was bad for our relationship. So I hadn't REALLY talked with him in like a year, even though I had convinced her to let him come visit once, she didn't say a word to him the whole time. I didn't know where else to go so I called him up. He picked up immediately, excited to hear from me, and this was our conversation: ""Dad, are you alone? And you promise not to freak out?"" ""Yes. What's the matter son?"" ""...my wife is having an affair."" ""Oh Throwaway... I'm so sorry."" My parents had gotten a divorce when I was 18. He really was sorry. I continued: ""Dad I'm sorry."" ""Son you didn't do anything wrong."" At this point, I can't hold it all together anymore. I lose it, completely, in car, at the parking lot of the grocery store. I haven't sobbed like that since I was a child. I'm crying right now as I type this. ""...Yes I did, I'm so sorry. I've been awful to you."" At this point, he starts crying too. And I sob more. ""I'm just sorry you're in pain, Throwaway. I'll tell you this so you don't feel like you have to keep saying you're sorry... I forgive you, but you haven't done anything to wrong me."" That's what love looks like. I'd been missing that feeling this whole time. This understanding that love makes sacrifices; doesn't focus on itself. And my dad has always loved me. Then he told me he'd pay for whatever I needed, no matter how he had to do it. When this is all over, I'll have a proper update probably in a new post. I'm so tired of pretending, but I need to hold out for another week. My little ones, my conversations with my dad, my close friends and the support from y'all keep me going. I hope to have another update by next Friday. Wish me luck. Also how long has there been a typo in the title?? Sheesh. TL;DR: stuck in a relationship with a cheater. Throwaway for obvious reasons and details changed, Yadda yadda. It all started a few months ago. There was a continuing education experience that I was looking into attending for my job. However, when I brought it up, my wife expressed interest in also going because it was not only something she was interested in, but she hadn’t been able to go in years because of our kids [2 boys, under 5 years]. I know moms work really hard to care for their kiddos especially in those younger years. I work full-time so the moment I get home I take the kid’s so she can get some rest. Anyway this request seemed difficult but I decided I’d put my neck out for her. After all, she deserves to grow too, right? So I spend my proverbial chips asking my boss if she can go instead of me. Surprisingly, he’s actually ok with it after our frank and candid discussion, so she’s able to go. I spend the week mostly home from work except when kids are at preschool, take care of the house and kids, and it’s an awesome week. The boys and I get really close, playing all kinds of games and solidifying the bedtime routine... Saturday rolls around when my wife is getting back, and she’s over the moon. It seemed like the conference was really good for her. She came back with a lot of stories, as she loves to tell stories about her events. She informs me she’s so happy she has friends she can talk to now and mentions that she’d like to go hang out with them now that she knows them. We live in a suburb, and they can all go hang out in the city together. I’m very excited for her as I haven’t seen her this happy in a while. She typically experiences bouts of depression so this was amazing. Fast forward a bit. She is getting ready to go hang out with them and she comes out from getting ready and she looks **cuuuuuute**. Little tank top, shorts that make her booty pop. I comment and just says thanks. She’ll be back in a while. She gets back and I ask how it went. “Good.” “...who did you hang out with?” “ I don’t know, people? You don’t know them.” I brushed it off, but notes that she didn’t tell me any stories. She always does that. She does this three more times. I start getting suspicious. She’s getting distant and she’s always on her phone. I start to put two and two together. Well, I see she’s on google hangout a lot. We know each other’s passwords for accountability, and hers is already up on my phone whenever I log in (but I don’t often log in). I start to think maybe she’s cheating. Then I have to convince myself she’s not. She wouldn’t do that. We’ve been married 9 years, we have two kids. She’s over in the city right now with her friends, it’s just a chill time to be herself. Right? I tried so hard but I couldn’t stop. I logged into google hangouts and there it was. One of the guys she met at the conference and her was at the top of the message list. All their correspondence was right there. It was vile. Things my wife and I had never said to each other. They were rendezvousing, just the two of them, to fuck. They were meeting up right now, at the “usual place”. And when they weren’t fucking, they were sexting like crazy. My kids were in the room while she was sending those messages. I almost threw up. My heart rate was at 175 at least. I felt every possible emotion a person could feel while sill having to care for the boys: make dinner, do baths, get ready for bed. I told them I was feeling sad, but not because of them, and that daddy might need a little more patience. They were amazing. That was 6 days ago. I’ve had to pretend, for 6 days, that nothing is wrong. I contacted a lawyer and I am filing for divorce. However, the retainer fee is way, WAY more than I or anyone in my family has. So I have to pretend everything is ok while I find this money. A couple nights ago she asked if I wanted to have sex and I said I had a headache. Then I *actually* was sick to my stomach and almost vomited again. I can’t have sex with her as the guy may not be clean and I don’t want a VD. Plus... it hurts to think about how she could do that. What did I do wrong? I have no idea what to do. She’s keeping up the charade just fine, but I’m cracking as time goes on. What should I do? I have to protect my boys from her... she’s not stable. Pathological liar, inappropriate conduct, and the kicker? We’re in the middle of marriage therapy. What should I do? Edit: People are asking why I am concerned about my kids. Good question. When I was 22 I met her at a convention... much like this one. Huh. It turned out she only lived like half an hour from me, so we started hanging out. Found out that until recently, she had a fiancee. No big deal... that's totally normal for a 20 year old to have gotten engaged and ended it, right? She said he cheated on her. [Press X to doubt] She showed up after we'd been dating for a bit with a suicide note in her hand. I took her inside and from that night onward, I didn't leave her side. I wanted to make sure she was safe. She would lock herself in the bathroom with razor blades and cut herself. Since the beginning of our relationship, and after we got married, she'd said she felt depression and thoughts of suicide at least five or six times. She also has absolutely no impulse control (obviously), she is a narcissist (everything is someone else's fault, never her own), and she doesn't have any emotionally healthy behaviors with the children (yells instead of communicates, tells them ""I'm done"" instead of parenting and just leaves it to me). My kids won't got to bed unless I put them down. I wake up with them every morning, and when they wake up in the middle of the night. I make and feed them breakfast, she sometimes makes them dinner (like she did last night) but usually she asks for fast food. Which is unfortunate because she does cook really well. All that and she lies about everything. She's unstable and inconsistent, and kids need emotional stability and consistency.",
202,"My son is suicidal after breakupMy son who is 26M recently broke up with his fiancé 26F, she finished with him and they have a 6 month old daughter together. They’ve been split up for nearly 4 months now and my son is suicidal because his ex-fiancé is cold and no longer interested and she’s taken his daughter away from him. He’s only allowed to see her for an hour on Wednesday and for 3 hours on Saturday. Each time his ex-fiancé has to be there as she won’t let him take her by himself. It’s tearing our family apart as we haven’t seen our grand daughter for 2 months. My son can’t deal with the stress and he’s spoken about suicide. What can we do to help him?",
203,"I'm worried that my son is suicidal, that he's listening to the alt-right, that he could hurt others. I lived a thousand miles away from him. I don't know what to do. He's not made specific threats against others, but he has about killing himself. I feel so helpless!",
205,"I think my son is suicidalI love my son, Johnny, but I think he's in a bad state right now. He sits in his room all day and night, and at 17 you'd think he'd be trying.... Something. I really don't care what he does: football, drama, art, ballet. I just want him to be happy. He just doesn't have that drive for life like a teenager should. He recently told my wife he hated her. He screamed it to her face after they argued over his grades. He's been slipping in school. He was a straight A student now down to Ds and Fs. I held her for hours after that. What happened to that happy little boy? What happened to my son? Why won't he let me in? I know I can help him. God, my poor boy. He has been bullied too for the way he dresses and acts. He's in his ""dark and brooding"" phase, but I hate that he takes it so seriously. I mean, I was into heavy metal and scared the crap out of my parents as well, but I never felt suicidal. I knew he was in trouble after the first bad self harm incident. He had apparently been cutting himself over the course of the past year and I caught him in the act recently. The fight, my God the fight. I brought him to a psychiatrist and the school therapist, but that only made him shut me out more. He just doesn't want help. I wish to God, how I wish, that I could've known what caused all this. According to the psychiatrist he has no reason to be as troubled as he is. They have found no root event in his childhood, they have found no chemical imbalance, they've found... Nothing. The darkness in his eyes now. God, the darkness. I made eye contact for the first time in months it felt, and it was like looking into the eyes of a shark. He is cold. Cold to us, cold to his friends, cold to everyone. I asked his friends about him and they feel the same as we do. The are worried. He has alienated himself and lashed out countlessly at his fellow peers. He has gotten beaten up by strangers and friends alike. I now wish we would have taken him out of school. He hates everyone and everything. He doesn't even do the normal actions of someone depressed. He eats his meals, he doesn't listen to depressing music(he's into heavy metal I think). He's not the way he used to be. He started to get this way around mid-freshman year, and it's been worsening ever since. He's a junior now, and I have no clue where to go for help. I just want the old Johnny back..",

211,"My mother is suicidal and has said she is experiencing Insomnia for the last two years since being with a ''Narcissist'', she wakes up every hour during the night and can't take it anymore, how can i help her as a son??I don't usually fall on the high spectrum of having high empathy but if something will invoke empathy in me, it is dealing with siblings going through stuff. My mother thoroughly believes she has CPTSD and that's tough as it is not a recognized condition in DSM 5 to diagnose, my mother has a history of fleeing a war torn countries in which she was exposed to people dying and chaos, however this didn't really affect her once she migrated here in Australia, instead she was in a severely abusive relationship with a man she believes had Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD), Their relationship was present from 2013 to 2018, they were no contact for a year in 2019, but in 2020 he has tried getting into her life again and she has been scared to block his number as she fears retaliation. The abuse was emotional but he did try put his hands on her once, the abuse involved chronic pathological lying, targeted abuse, gaslighting. She also has history (possibly) of CSA, but she cannot remember all the details. Her father was a diagnosed Psychopath (ASPD). I can attest to his diagnosis because i also have lots of traits of NPD, ASPD, hinting a genetic component, (i also have a diagnosed Cluster B personality disorder myself) Her problem now which is affecting all areas of life is that she is waking up almost every hour. If she goes to bed at midnight she will open her eyes at 2:00 AM and will not fall asleep till 2:15 AM, she will than wake up again at 3:00 AM, than 5:00 AM, 6:30 AM, 7:00 AM, 9:00 AM, and from 9 she will toss and turn, she feels incredibly lethargic so she stays into bed till lunch. I can see her condition is very psychological, i don't think a pill would just help, i would love to get her to do CBT but English is limited, she talks to me about this every day and has told me to try find some advice online. She saw a doctor a few weeks ago and has been on Mirtazapine, she says it has helped her mood and anxiety issues, but her sleep is still very poor. How can i finally get my mother the life she dreams of having? the whole family is behind her on this and fixing this debilitating issue,.",
212,"So, my son is thinking about suicide because of bullying.What the fuck do I do. He is nine years old, telling me he's been having nearly daily thoughts of suicide lately, describing the thoughts as beyond his control. He says he feels perpetually bullied, targeted, and ""persecuted"" (which is a hot word, and with a schizophrenic family history, very alarming.) A lot of the bullying he tells me about doesnt add up to bullying in my eyes. Being called a nerd, being teased for not being athletic, people mispronouncing his name wrong... these things suck, but I tell him he needs to learn how to brush it off and keep going. He tells me he cant. He has been so tense, on edge, and angry lately, hes not the same kid he used to be. And he says he cant stop that anger anymore. Then, there are instances where kids are holding him down and stealing his glasses, shit like that is absolutely bullying, and I'm fighting wars to get it to stop. My kids not killing himself because his school is incompetent. Am I in the wrong here for telling him he needs to be less sensitive and brush off some or this stuff? Is the right thing to do to have his back 100%? I make a point to remind him how much I love him, how important he is to so many people. But I admittedly expect a lot of him, and am probably contributing to the issues. I'm trying to be more laid back. He has an anxiety, depression, and ADHD diagnosis. Hes been in an out of counseling with little progress. I am going to call a few places to try to get him in. I'm gonna work with him on mindfulness for anxiety and letting go. I'm gonna try to help him find something creative to do to let some of this out. What am I missing? Is there anything else i should be doing that I'm not?

223,"[TOMT] [MOVIE] [2000s] Horror/Psychological Thriller - Opening Scene is Son Killing Mom and Sister, then Committing Suicideok so - this has bothered me since childhood. pls prepare for a long dump of possibly unhelpful information. I was watching this movie on either Starz or HBO or a similar cable movie channel in the late 2000s, and it terrified me as a child. Opening scene takes place in the family’s house, where an older teen son (maybe long blonde hair?) with a tortured soul type vibe kills his mother and little sister. He leaves them on their knees with their wrists bound by wire in front of them, as if in prayer. Not sure if we actually see him kill them, or just their bodies, but I remember there being a shot of their mangled faces, like they died screaming or crying. I’m not positive, but I think the father was set up to be the protagonist of the movie and was maybe law enforcement or something? (not positive about that). either way i think he was rushing home because he knew something was wrong, and the movie cuts to that as the murder suicide plays out. I think there was a definite satanic/culty vibe to the son, and I’m pretty sure there is a pentagram made of blood drawn on the floorboards. the son then dramatically throws his body onto a sword in the center of the pentagram. this shot is filmed through a doorway, if i remember correctly. whole family is white. the scenes were all very gray and moody (fitting lol), and i think it was rainy or maybe just cloudy outside as this happened. there were definitely panning shots of the house interior, but i can’t remember what they were showing. i think the final scene i watched was of the devastated dad coming home to the bloody scene. being a smol and impressionable child, i promptly switched to the disney channel to nurse my psychological wounds, so i have no idea what the movie’s overarching plot or themes were. any help would be much appreciated because i’m beginning to wonder if this ever happened or if maybe i just had a freakishly graphic dream.",

229,"This is a long story; Should my boyfriend move out?Ok Reddit, here we go. My boyfriend is in college and he grew up relatively well-off. He grew up moving every 1-2 years, has a couple expensive medical conditions and sometimes had to live in temporary housing like at a church. However, his (divorced) parents were able to buy him a used car in high school so he could get a job and he always had a place to stay. About a year into the relationship I could tell that he definitely had a narcissistic mother-- she would guilt trip him into everything, deny him access to things like therapy and jobs he liked that would give him more Independence and I found out later that as a kid she had convinced a doctor that he had ADHD in order to put him on medicine that essentially turned him into a zombie. Now that he was going to college he has been ok because he has been separated from her for most of the year. This summer (he's now 21) it's the last summer before graduating college and he is definitely more independent than when I met him-- he actually tells her no sometimes. Part of it is college and part of it is having someone around him and her constantly (me) and telling him it's ok to say no if he's uncomfortable doing something. About two weeks ago his mother asked him to pick her up at the airport at 9:30 pm, he said yes. The day of the pickup she said ""actually come at 11:30 pm, if that's too late I'll take an Uber"" he didn't feel comfortable driving that late at night and asked her to take an uber. She asked him to leave the keys in the garage and he did. Two days after that event she went after him (emotionally). She told him that she paid for his car (in high school) and for his insurance (which she said she would until he graduated so he could have to the car) and that that means that if she asks him to do something he is obligated to do it for him. For 30 minutes she put him down about not having a job (he's been trying and has applied to about 5 jobs a day since he's been home but no one wants to hire for just the summer). She told him he's paying the insurance in two weeks or she will sell his car. I understand wanting him to help with insurance but she knows he doesn't have a job yet. And $200 in two weeks is almost impossible without a job. She also told him that she was disgusted that she had to pay for his food and that he thinks it's ok to just lay in bed all day. (He's living with her and food has never been a problem before). He also does have a job writing but it's not what she wants him to do-- his major is writing. so he doesn't just lay in bed all day. She told him that he has shown no respect, curteousy or consideration for her (mentioned that he keeps the house in awful shape-- not true she gets very obsessive with cleaning and 3 crumbs on the floor is unironically a huge issues) and then she told him that she was done with him. Then she proceeded to try to verbally attack me (whether as another way of getting to him or just because she was upset with me too). I've dealt with my own narcissistic father and knew better than to respond to her and that stopped after about two sentences. After this, my boyfriend broke down. He didn't sleep at all and was very suicidal. I also found out that one of his friends had killed themselves that same weekend. This is when I told him that I think he has a narcissistic mother and showed him a video. He asked me to take him to a psych hospital/ ER because he didn't feel safe/ trust himself. I did but when he got there he felt bad because he's on his parents insurance and they would've been the ones to pay for it. Instead we cleaned his room and left for my house so he would be with dogs and my family, he would not be alone or with his mom and they could both have a little space. He asked me not to text her so I didn't. I guess he didn't either so she didn't know we left. She asks where we are about a day later and I end up responding because I feel like she should know. I tell her about the hospital and that we left and that he's still looking for jobs. I then tell her that I'm sorry we didn't let her know and that we figured she would want space. This is what she sent: ""Well at least I know (that we aren't home). This is unacceptable. Convenient that he chooses to blame it on the cost (going to the hospital). His father holds his insurance so he can deal with that if necessary (again hospital). All I have ever asked for is consideration and courtesy. Neither have been given.""

I'm thinking maybe he should just move out? He might be able to live with his dad and he's almost out of college. Is his mom right, should he just get a job and stay home?

230,My grandmother is suicidal after the death of her sonMy grandmother lost her only son last year and she’s been going down ever since. My grandmother has lost tremendous weight and she’s refusing to eat. She’s only drinking chicken broth and it’s hurting her health. She has diabetes and high cholesterol. When we keep asking her why she doesn’t eat and she says because she thinks of her son. It’s so bad now that she’s being admitted to the hospital every 3 days for low sugar. Another thing that send my grandmother in a frenzy is having things that remind her of her son everyday single day. She has 3 large posters of her son surrounding her and it sends her in a mood. We have suggested therapy and counseling but she is refusing help. Should I take the pictures down and admit her into a mental institution?,
231,"My ndad sometimes threatens to call the police and have me 5150'd when he's upset about anything at all in his life.Dad's upset about something at work? Suddenly he's threatening immediate eviction by the police via 5150. That's how my life is sometimes. Whenever I see my dad I always have to wonder ""is dad gonna do some crazy upsetting shit today?"" These days, 50% of the time the answer is yes. It's been getting milder as he's been getting older, but he still freaks out big time sometimes. Like a few weeks ago when he busted my door down in the middle of the night ""because you didn't take out the trash."" It's bizarre that the police empower him to harass me, and that they disregarded my statement that I was not suicidal. He donated a huge amount to the police years back, and apparently they now just let him have whatever he wants when he calls them up to do his bidding. 5150 is the California code for an involuntary 72 hour psychiatric hold. The point of it is basically to restrain people who might hurt themselves or somebody else. My dad realized all he has to do is call 911 and say ""my son is suicidal"" and shortly thereafter he's got the cops punishing me because he wills it. I don't need to be suicidal for that to occur. It's probably illegal, but that's what they've been doing. Kind of like ""swatting"", and my dad is the one that does this to me. So that sucks. This previous bogus hospitalization cost me $1200, the loss of the job I had at the time (can't use your phone in the mental hospital), and suspension of one of my constitutional rights. Plus it makes police act weird with me anytime I get a traffic ticket and they adapt behavior based on what the computer tells them when they look me up. ""5150 = Crazyperson"" seems to be their usual interpretation. It also seems to make them totally disregard whatever I'm saying even in situations where I'm calling for help in a situation totally unrelated to me, like noticing a semi truck swerving all over the road. I'll betcha they always look at the screen info and think ""great, it's a 5150 guy. fuck this guy."" They definitely talk like they're thinking something along those lines. My dad is the actual crazyperson in this family. He has gotten really drunk and threatened immediate eviction countless times, even when I was a little kid and he clearly had absolutely no socially-acceptable basis for his threat. I was always a good kid but it never mattered. My dad was just always angry and pretended like I was his problem. And still, after all these years, my nmom still pretends like everything's fine, and tries to get me to stop talking and talks over me and gives me incredibly terrible advice anytime I talk. My mom is disturbingly blind to my dad's insanity. When everyone else in the room is noticing my dad's ramping up in anger, my mom just smiles and genuinely does not notice at all. Then she acts surprised when he freaks out, and passively pretends like ""stahhhhp"" but not really. Unless he gets physically violent. That's ""where she draws the line"", ya know? Probably should count psychological abuse and the other crazy shit my dad does as part of the abuse. Because I definitely notice it and it screws me up in life on the daily. All of my siblings are in our 30s and we're still heavily dependent on my aging parents. All working for the family business and my dad's an asshole to all of us daily. Just recently, when my dad broke my door down in the middle of the night, a cop was acting like my dad's the good guy here and he gets to decide whatever he wants Maybe at 30-something we should be independent of our parents, right? Not when we've been trained to be babies well into adult ages. We're old infants. It's really sad how real that is. We never really grew up. Anytime we show a hint of individual capability or attempt to be independent from them, my parents fuck us up and bring us back to the ""just a start"" zone. Baby mode. We're permababies as long as we're here with them, and, shockingly, the local cops help to ensure that occurs. Bizarre, because last time my dad broke my door down, one of the cops acted like it's all my fault if I'm not living independently in one of the most expensive areas in the world with parents that routinely fuck up my mind to keep me as their narcissistic supply. He had no idea what was going on, and just invented his own explanation which he used as a basis for his choice of how to handle the situation. My parents are getting old, and if my mom dies first then I'm pretty certain my dad's going to liquidate the assets, go drink himself to death in Vegas, and leave us all to fend for ourselves. Something along those lines. So that'll be fun. The city where I live has an abnormally large concentration of narcissistic people, often bothering each other based on their conflicting selfish interests. I've traveled to other places. It's particularly bad here, and the past few months it's been looking like they've been ramping up in narcissistic rage towards each other. So that's concerning. Because I know what kind of crazy shit a raging narcissist can do. My dad used to be like that and still sometimes is. All of this is depressing to me, but I'm not suicidal. Doesn't seem to matter what I say though. If people feel like",

246,"Should I be upset? My mom felt a man finding out his daughter is a lesbian was as bad as that same man losing his son to suicideApologies for the lengthy title but I didnt want to be guilty of click bait with just ""should I be upset"". Let me preface this with the fact that I love my mom. She's one of my best friends. She doesnt know, at least that I know of, that I identify as pansexual. I've always been very openly supportive of the LBGTQ community, long before I came to terms with my own sexuality. If comments get ignorant or aggressive, I'll delete this. I realize that's like saying I'm never shopping at this store again, but I at least need to say it. So a good childhood/early adulthood friend of my brother (30M) committed suicide on monday. My dad was super close to both the son and the father through Boy Scouts. My brother moved out of state, otherwise I'm sure the two guys would have remained super close. Regardless, it was very upsetting. I (32F) have a precious suicide attempt so I knew this would trigger some feelings for my parents. I'm sure it did but my mom was super PC about everything and even remarked that it's (depression) and how can anyone hold that against anyone. Etc. Anyways, my mom said something about the sister's wife and I said I didnt realize she was a lesbian (not to presume a label but for the sake of conversation). My mom said yeah and the dad struggled with it bc he was raised catholic and the bible is against it (in a half joking manner I mentioned the bible's disagreement with bacon, etc) but none of that bothered me. She even said the dad came around bc he saw his daughter was happy. Love it, dream of it. All good. Then my mom proceeds to say how she felt so bad for the dad because he's been through so much. > First a marriage he was unhappy in but ""couldnt"" leave bc of the Catholic's view on divorce; then his daughter comes out; then his son kills himself. She said ""what else could possibly happen"". I said I hardly think his daughter being a lesbian is on par with his son committing suicide. I fully expected her to correct herself, it just being a poor choice of phrasing. Instead, in a serious voice, she said it was the same and that to people in their 60's (she's 68) it is just as bad because back then people weren't gay and it wasnt like it is now. We're (our generation) so much more open to these kinds of things. I was shocked. Much like every other moment where my mom, knowingly or not, dismissed my feelings, I said nothing. I dont remember everything she said but the themes and messages one could infer from the above are accurate. It wasnt that finding out your child is gay is difficult and heavy for multiple reasons including the generation you grew up in, It was totally his child coming out as a lesbian is just as bad as his other child committing suicide. I know my mom loves me and I honestly believe she'd accept me as pansexual after many tears, prayers, and questions (and I'm ok with that). But this hurt. And perhaps what made it hurt the most was this very thing was something I spent years mulling over with my therapist. Feeling like after everything I put my parents through - depression, addiction, suicide attempt, etc. - that being pansexual was one more thing I was punishing them with. One more way to let them down. My friends always assured me that was not the case. To hear my mom articulate the very fears I had finally quieted (after years) was overwhelming. My friend suggested I tell them. That perhaps putting it out there will help remove the terror and ignorance. That they wouldn't say those things if they knew. But having heard those things makes it even harder to want to tell them. Am I overreacting? My friend was empathetic and kind but I felt like she thought I should chalk it up to them not knowing. She agreed it was hurtful and it was ok to be hurt, but also not to take it too seriously. I'm sick of the excuse that my parents dont know. You shouldn't have to have an LGBTQ child to not feel those things. Ugh. Thanks for reading ... xoxo",

Is this normal procedure?EDIT: Thank you... everyone who has responded here and even went far to DM me advice or share resources. Thank you so much... UPDATE: New discovery with the circumstance of the son's death has pushed for further investigation. I don't know the exact nature of this, but there was enough suspicion that it called for an investigation. What I understand now is that the family was first told the death was a possible suicide but was never concluded as one, but the family began pooling money anyway. That's when my friend sold his truck and I wrote the first post. I am still questioning where they got this idea that suicide voids SGLI and other VA assistance though. I have yet to talk to the ex's family, but I also understand if they jumped to conclusion from grief and panic. What I also understand is that none of the family has received anything as beneficiary as of yet. Today, due to a possible related event with the son's death, the family requested for a second autopsy, and further examination is to be expected. The transportation of the son has been postponed. My friend was calm this noon as I was able to maintain longer conversation. I was able to suggest what you all have kindly provided me, VA resources that may assist him and his family financially. His ex-parents-in-laws have also flown over last night to be with him. They now wait for further updates and plan the next step. It's still not comforting what may have happened to the son, but i can only hope my friend and his family can find peace soon... In hindsight, it seems I too have overreacted and gave harsh judgement to military protocol and the actual care provided to servicemen and families for events like this. I apologise whole-heartedly. Finally, I thank each one of you once again. -------------------- First of all, I apologize if i used any military term incorrectly. Second, I am asking this question entirely of my own and not speaking in behalf of my friend. Third, I hope this is the correct subreddit to ask this. My good friend's son recently had committed suicide while living in army base. This has been a devastating event for the dad. The son is the child between him and his ex-wife. I have been keeping in close touch with the dad who has been my long friend, as I feared he too may go into depression. I learned that he sold his only truck to get his son back to his family. He was told that suicide was considered dishonorable and the expenses is to be shouldered by the family. My question is, is this normal? I understand and don't expect the military to compensate for funeral services or any additional expenses, but i assumed they would at least assist in delivering the body back to the family. My concern is that my friend isn't exactly rich. He has this 1997 Nissan truck which is his only way to get around places and to work, and I know neither he or I can afford to buy another car right now. The moment he was told that they need to come up with the money to deliver the body, he sold his truck without hesitation. I fear this event may financially cripple him and have unwanted consequences for his mental health as he had spoken about following after his son. The least I can do right now is to help pay for his flight to his ex-wife to greet his son when he arrives. I'm just finding myself saddened how my friend's case was handled especially for a family who are financially struggling. Wondering what if the family was ultimately unable to provide to pay for the transportation, would the body remain in the base indefinitely until they are able to? Is this how suicide victims are treated or its the general procedure of any death of servicemen? Or maybe there's something that I'm missing or not seeing. I'm sorry if I sound accusatory against military procedure. This is not my intention. I myself am emotionally stirred as I am having hard time choosing the correct word to express this. It's difficult seeing your friend goes through something like this. I may be projecting my frustrations and this is me trying to cope. If anyone can clarify this, I sincerely appreciate it.",

277,"My (50f) daughter and husband (15F, 49M) died. My son (18M) recently attempted suicide. I feel like part of this is my fault and now its too late.I am not sure if this is the right place for this. &#x200B; My daughter died from cancer, a very fast acting cancer which she choose to not get treatment for. Over the span of 4 months, she deteriorated and then died. During this time, my husband turned into a severe alcoholic and drug abuser. I got depressed, as did my son. Watching my daughter, the sweetest child in the world, pass away like that was horrific. &#x200B; My husbands alcoholism (and drug abuse, he was doing pills heavily as well, although tried to keep it secret) spiraled out of control to the point where he was drinking a 20 dollar bottle of vodka every day, and then some more after. He would often go out and not come home for the entire night. My son kept on trying to get him to stop, and I sort of tried... but I was so depressed that I just didnt have the heart to put in much emotional effort into him. I isolated myself completely, and was like a zombie. My husband died in our basement bathroom, covered in his own vomit. He died from a mix of huge amounts of alcohol and huge amounts of xanax and tramadol mixed together. I knew he was doing pills, but I never knew the real extent of it until we found his stash of pills after he died. His death came about 3-4 months after my daughters death. &#x200B; After my husband died, I sort of woke up from my daze, but not for long before I fell back into it. My son also fell into a horrible, deep depression. It wasn't only his dad and sister dying. His grades fell apart, he got rejected from almost every college except for community colleges. He gained well over 100 pounds in the year after his dad died. Both of us were just a mess. I didn't leave bed most days, he stayed in his room... doing whatever he would do. Video games I imagined. I didn't ignore the signs completely the way I did with my husband. I tried to reach out to him, get him into therapy, for a while. But my own depression was so bad that I was giving up on everything. I think at a certain point we just left each other alone. &#x200B; In the 2 months before, we barely spoke at all. It wasn't hard, our house is big, our rooms are far apart. And then he tried to kill himself, by throwing himself off of a bridge nearby. He survived. He got a broken foot and his toe is all mangled, but he survived. I saw where he threw himself off, it was a long distance. I don't even know how he managed to only break his foot. &#x200B; I feel such a wave of guilt flow over me since the incident. Both for him and for my husband too. I didn't pay enough attention, I didn't give them what they needed, I was selfish honestly. I am their mother and wife and I just isolated myself instead of being with them and helping them and getting them through this. I constantly think that if I was more attentive, more demanding for my husband to get sober, then this wouldn't have happened. None of it. Losing my daughter was horrible, but we couldn't control that. But this? This is our decisions. And my presence influences their decisions arguably more than anything. &#x200B; I just don't know what to do. I want to help my son but don't know how, and I feel he is ignoring my attempts to help him, because I have ignored him for so long. I can't tell if he is still suicidal. I can't tell if the second his foot heals he is going to try again. I am 'awake' in that I am aware of my being and place instead of being a depressed zombie like I have been for the past 2 years... but I am feeling hopeless again that I cant help.",

294,"My son has been having suicidal thoughts for the past year. When I read his journal, this is what I found.It had always been there, slithering in the night. The dark shadow it left behind, the horrors of the people who would consume it. It waited for them, feeding on the evil in their hearts. It was quite easy. The darkness knew about the evils of man. The darkness had been consuming lives since the dawn of time, and its next victim was in the wait. It had been there since the boy was born. It always picked its victims at youth. If they heard it's voice when they were young they would be gradually easier to overcome. It started with a whisper in your dreams, an afterthought in your head. *Come to me*, it would say. *Use me*, it would beg. And so it would begin, the boy would take the darkness. Then the darkness would take the boy with him to the darkest pits of hell. It had started. The boy was one, just mastering the skill of walking. The darkness knew it was time. It crept at the edge of the forest, silently watching, neither moving or speaking. The boy was walking just on the outside of the woods, happily enjoying his time with his parents. If the darkness could smile it would. This was a time of happiness, a time of great joy. A moment like this could easily be ruined, and it would ripple through the boys life. The monster of the shadows slithered forward, and now it would start hunting its prey. The boy was excited. All of his life he had crawled on the ground, but now he would take his first steps. He was overjoyed, ecstatic even. He stepped one foot on the ground then he heard a thump behind him. The boy heard screaming and then the shouting of his father. The boy didn't know what was happening. Why were they screaming? What had happened? The boy was confused. Thunderous noises played from afar. There was screeching and more voices who joined the first. The boy kept hearing one repeated phrase, *dead, dead*. He didn't know what was happening, what was going on. The boy then heard another voice, but this one was only in his head. *There there*, whispered the voice. The voice was comforting and warm. The boy was scared and confused, he needed someone to be there for him. *I'm here for you. I am your friend. They won't hurt you. They can't touch you. All you need is me.* The boy was comforted by the voice. Maybe it could help him. Maybe it could take away the pain. Don't be scared child. I'm all you need. The young boy didn't know what had just happened, but his new friend could now make things better. Five years later and the boy had a best friend. The darkness was his companion, his comforter. It could take his problems away. That fateful day five years ago, his mother had died of a heart attack. But he didn't need her, he had the darkness. All he needed was him. The darkness loved him, cherished him. It was his companion. He loved the darkness and the darkness loved him. This was exactly what the beast wanted him to think. The boy talked to the darkness regularly now. They had conversation that lasted for hours. *Don't go to them. They will only hurt you.* The darkness told the boy not to play with any other children he saw. The boy eagerly obeyed, wanting to please his friend. Why need anyone else? The darkness was always there for him. The boy could talk to him anytime. His dad thought that this thing wasn't real. He presumed that the beast was only a figment of the boys imagination. The boy knew the truth. This creature was real, and it loved him. Five more years had past and the boy was sweating nervously. He was in a shop clutching a bottle in his hand. His father had given into grief and now drunk a vile poison. His father was now always angry, throwing and muttering things under his breath. He would slam the boy on the kitchen table and beat him. Nobody would sell his father more of that poison so now, his father needed him to take it by force. The boy was scared, what if the people found out and hurt him, what if they beat him like his father has? *They won't hurt you, I am here. With me by your side they won't lay a finger on you.* The boy nods, comfort in his heart. His friend would protect him. The darkness would keep him safe. The boy slipped the bottle into the coat and slipped away with his fathers prize. The boy trembled as he walked to his father. No matter what he did he would never please him. At least he had his darkness. Five years later and the boy shared in his father’s poison. He had no other way. The despair clawed the way into his heart. The sadness drowned him. The darkness encouraged him to do it. *It is a gift. It will help you. He won't hurt you if you share in his delight.* The boy reluctantly drunk the poison, and it became his companion. Ten years later and the boy was on the streets. This boy who was once a child, full of youth and light. He had destroyed himself. He trembled as he sipped the poison. He sobbed, years of despair and regret pulled at him. He had rejected friends and family. He had fought and harmed others. All because the darkness told him. It would not be his friend anymore if he didn't. The boy, now a man, realized with bitterness this thing was not his friend. It had caused the death of his mother. It had filled his father with grief and pain. It gave him the very thing his father thought would take the pain away. The darkness wasn't the boys friend. The darkness was this man’s worst enemy. One year later and the man was living in a dump. He had nowhere else to go. No friends, and no family that cared about him. But the man had a solution. He could solve all his problems with one movement. He could end the pain and free himself from the beast that had ruined his life. As he lifted the key to his freedom to his head, memories swarmed the man's head. His mom, his father. What he could have been. The people that he could have met. The wife he could have married. All of these thoughts invaded him and a single tear dropped down the man’s face. With a quick flick of the finger and a bang, the man was gone. The darkness chuckled. All these years of temptation its work was complete. The years of pretending to be his friend and comforter. The darkness made the boy dependent on him and driven him to madness. It's work was done. A young girl would be born in a hospital nearby. She would be joyfully welcomed by friends and family. If only she knew about the best friend she would soon have.",
296,"Update: Bf [20M] threatened to commit suicide when I [20F] broke up with him.OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3rcn8z/bf_20m_threatened_to_commit_suicide_when_i_20f/ So I took all your advice and broke up with him. I just hope it's the right decision though because things got really crazy. I texted his best friend and told him what happened and said that I wanted to break up for good and asked for his help. I could not tell his family since they make me uncomfortable and I know if I told them that their son is suicidal they'd immediately blame me for manipulating him. Anyhow, his friend was really nice about it and said that he'd look after my bf John (not his real name) when I decide to break up. After that I called John and asked to meet him at the food court on the mall. We talked and I said that I couldn't be in our relationship anymore and I was feeling suffocated. He said that he doesn't understand, he thought that I was over this since we talked about it. I told him that I was just saying that because I felt panicked. He started crying in public and I felt so bad for him. Then he begged me to talk about it more in private. I figured it's the least I could do since I'm breaking up with him so we went to his place and talked more. He started trying to be sweet, talking about the sweet and romantic stuff we did. I admit that I felt really bad for breaking up then, and I wanted to get back with him, but I had to remind myself that I needed some space. He started crying harder and I couldn't take it anymore so I went to the bathroom and tried to collect myself. When I went back to his room I saw him trying to hide my shoes. asked him what he was doing and he looked guilty and said nothing, but I think he wanted to hide it so I wouldn't be able to leave. At that point I just really wanted to go so I asked for my shoes, he gave it but he was blocking the door. I said I'd start screaming if he doesn't let me leave, so he moved aside and started following me, all this time he was begging and saying he'd give me more space and asking ""what am I going to do now?"" And also saying how he'd kill himself if I leave. But I was so tired of that. I said if you keep following me I'm going straight to the police station and say you assaulted me with a serious face (I was bluffing) so he stopped following and I went home. I texted his friend and asked him if John was OK and he said that he's been crying and locked up in his room, and I asked about his gun and my friend said that he hid and locked it so he won't think of using it (they're roommates) . I changed my number when I got home so I don't know if John was texting me. I also deactivated my Facebook so I didn't have to deal with him. But since I broke up with him, he'd be at the front of our house just sitting there waiting for me. And he knows my schedule so I just ask my brother for a ride to my class. I tried asking my dad and brother to talk to him, And my dad did, but he just felt sorry for him after they talk, and since he's not really doing anything that it's OK -_- I just have to deal with him until he gets tired of it I guess? Sorry for the wall of text and the grammar. I'm feeling weird so I just wanted to tell someone I guess. I'll update if something important Happens TLDR; broke up with bf, he's still following me around",
297,"And just like clockwork - I’m to blame for the fact her son is a piece of shit. TW: suicideFH called his dad yesterday to see how he was doing. He called me afterward and told me that he was worried because his dad was real short with him on the phone. He then called his mom to see if everything was ok with fil. She said that because of his deteriorating health, he’s been short with everyone. I didn’t buy it but whatever. I could feel a storm a-brewing. I was right. Mil texted FH last night to let him know that Family Friends son had tried to commit suicide on Tuesday night. FH texted FF to see if they were both ok. This morning, FH called mil to see if she had an update about ff’s son. Now, FF lives pretty close to BIL (about a four hour drive away). Mil then just started in on FH and said she was going to [town] and was going to stop in on ff to see how she was and that FH should come “without [me] and speak to BIL.” FH asked who was going to be there because at this point he didn’t know if she was visiting BIL or not but also that he would certainly not be doing that, especially without me. She said “For fucks sake FH, you need to get over it. You and OP are in the wrong and you need to stop this bullshit **now**. I will not put up with this any longer, she [me] needs to get the fuck over it. **she** is in the wrong.” Of course FH, not expecting this, began to sort of stutter which he does sometimes when he’s anxious. He said we still have not received an apology and as such, he will still not be speaking to his brother. She said that he still asks her to do stuff for her (he doesn’t) and that why would she do anything for him when **he can’t do anything for her**. I later said to FH when he was retelling this that you don’t do things for people because you want something in return. She started swearing and screaming at him and hung up. I was livid. Absolutely fucking livid. She’s throwing a fucking tantrum because we aren’t just lying down and taking the abuse. I hate her so much that my blood boils. So all this happened while FH was at work and I was at home. Time started getting on and I was wondering where he was because he usually calls me when he finishes work, which he would have about two hours earlier. So I called him. He was at her house. He said he was there to pick something up from Neighbour Boss, but NB wasn’t home yet. I was trying not to scream but told him that I’d just see him when he got home, thinking he’d also went over to talk. He came home later on, **NOTHING** of the conversation this morning was mentioned. She didn’t even allude to it and neither did he. Well I just lost it and told him **exactly** how o feel about the hole he crawled out of. I said that she was a sorry excuse for a mother, that she was an asshole and that I cannot fucking stand her. That she throws tantrums to get what she wants and abuses him until he submits. That she says anything she can to hurt him to smack him back in line and that I’m done. I said he needed to grow some balls, put his foot down and fucking stick to it otherwise nothing will change. That if I didn’t love him so much I would have left by now. He said he was hurt by this but I told him that this was going to be the rest of my life now and that is not something I am willing to accept or resign to. I said she’s only going to get worse when we get married, after we’re married and when we have kids. I told him I don’t want her around our children after the way I have seen her treat her own. I said “Do something about it or I will and it will **not** be beneficial for you if I do.” I also said that she uses to excuse of “but he’s my son!” To defend BIL but does not offer FH the same courtesy. I was damn near hysterical crying by the end because I’m so enraged. FH said that he feels shit about it because no one has still actually sat and listened to what he has to say and that he still has a lot to get off his chest. I said I feel the same way because anytime we try and say anything we are literally swore at and shouted down and told to shut up. So advice please - if I did decide to text/email mil (undecided yet) how exactly should I word this? What I want to say is that I’m disgusted with the way FH is treated by his whole family and that I will not be a part of it, nor will I “let go” of the abuse BIL has inflicted upon me for years. I will **not** take any form of blame for having enough self respect to stick up for myself, and I certainly will not submit to the tantrums of she and BIL. My finger is literally on the trigger right now. I have so so so much fucked up shit happening in my life right now aside from this and my mental health is the worst it’s been in years. I’ve been prescribed anti depressants (which is probably another fault) have contemplated suicide over the last few weeks and even had a seizure due to stress for fucks sake. None of this relates to mil and co., and it’s to do with an entirely different issue I have going on, but mil knows a large portion of what’s going on and the stress and anxiety it’s causing me. She just doesn’t give a fuck. You’d think as well that if ff’s son has attempted suicide this week, she’d maybe reflect on how she treats her son and how it affects his mental health (which a few weeks ago he tried to explain but she brushed it off to tell him how big of a piece of shit he is) or she’d like hold her son a little closer, but no. I know for a fact that she’s going to blame FH and I for causing undue stress for fil which is causing his health to deteriorate which is simply not true. She’ll pull any sort of fucked up tactic for us to fall back in line. I think she hates me because I’ve helped FH shine his spine and I will happily take the blame. She’s such a selfish fucking cunt. I hate her so much. I fucking hate BIL more than I’ve ever hated anyone in my life. He still has not contacted FH which FH is more than happy with. What do I do? I’m already NC but it hasn’t helped as much as it should have because I still have so much I feel like I have to say that I can’t and I feel like I’m going to explode.",
300,[Theo Fleury] 15 years ago I had a fully loaded pistol in my mouth ready to end my life not because I wanted to die but I was exhausted from living in emotional pain and suffering. I started talking about my trauma and started to heal. #WorldSuicidePreventionDay,
302,"I think Im ready to end my life.Ive been dealing with my own negative thoughts for 8 years of my life. I cant find help from my family cause they just get mad at me and tell me that all I have to do is go to school and watch my niece. Im fine with all of it but tonight just tipped the scales. (Im sorry if this gets confusing. Im writing this while crying.) For the past almost 2 years ive been watching my niece everytime i have free time cause my sister has work and beauty school. Im fine with watching her when necessary but tonight my mom, dad, and sister wanted to go to the bar. Earlier today i told my sister that i didnt want to watch my niece cause i had to watch her from 7 to noon today. I go to bed at 8 cause im tired and i hear my dad calling for me and i yell down that im not watching her tonight and thats when my mom starts screaming at me telling me that my life isnt hard and that i just need to suck it up. I know my life isnt hard but I haven't been able to be a teenager because of family issues from my sister having a baby with a abusive man and his family ruining our already failing family. I have to watch my niece everyday, deal with both my parents fighting nonstop, deal with my sister going back to the father of her baby and getting all worked up when he beats her again. I never complain about any of it. I go to school and get good grades, i dont get in any trouble whatsoever, i dont ask for anything that cost money, i dont bother anyone, i dont even complain when im losing all my friends around me cause my home life is fucking me up and i dont know who the fuck i am anymore im losing my fucking mind. I started crying when my mom yelled and she says ""im not gonna pity you just because you pulled the "" i have anxiety card"" you dont even know what having difficulties is like."" My parents dont even try to understand what wrong with me they just get annoyed and get mad at me. Im tired of everything. At school Im the kid that tries to make sure everyone is happy and I take on any task that people need me to do cause I cant say no. Im so tired. Im in my junior year of high school and no one ever believes me when i ask for help cause i want to die cause ive always been the happy kid and the happy kid cant be sad. Im not the best kid but im sure as hell not the worst and im tired of feeling like shit when im around my parents and im going to kill myself soon enough. Im sorry for my rant and for it being so long. I just am hoping that someone might read this and understand me for the first time in my life. I feel so alone. Im so tired.",
303,"[X-post from r/depression] I am ready to end my lifeI don't know what else to do anymore. I'm in my mid-30s,single and never married, no kids, unemployed, stuck in the middle of nowhere living with my toxic narcissistic mother. I've been suffering from depression for months and when I try to open up or talk about it, people say I'm making excuses, and not trying hard enough. I keep trying to find a job, and getting nowhere, I've been to so many interviews, only to suffer the old bait-and-switch. All my experience is the restaurant business, as a dishwasher, busboy, and a waiter. I keep applying for restaurant jobs that advertise how they need dishwashers, and prep cooks, or busboys, during the day, but when I interview it's for a line cook position, at night! I can't do that job. I've tried on several occasions, and I just can't do it. I'm not good at it, and I don't like doing it. But for some reason it seems to be all I can find, and I hate this weird stereotype that if you want a career in a restaurant you have to cook. THERE ARE OTHER JOBS IN A RESTAURANT BESIDES COOKING! It doesn't help matters that I need daytime hours. The reason being, that, I live in the country, the nearest town is about 20 miles away. I don't have a driver's license because no one wants to help me get it. I've held a learner's permit for almost a year, and I have next to no driving experience, and no one wants to help me get that experience or help me learn to drive. My only chance of getting a job is find one in town. in order to make that work I either have to have transportation to and from, or live in town so I can ride my bike there. I can't ride my bike into town everyday because the highway between here and there is a death trap of steep hills, blind curves, and redneck drivers who will not share the road with someone on a bike. The few times I've tried it were not only exhausting, but I was nearly killed several times by drivers who have no tolerance for a bicycle on the highway. Staying in town means being homeless, and shelters lock their doors at around 10pm. Any night time job means not getting off work until 11pm at the earliest, and the shelters do not make exceptions, regardless of your circumstances, they just ask ""Can't you switch to days?"" Umm... No, I can't, the only hours they had available were nights. If I had transportation, or a place in town, I could make it work, but I don't have either of those things, which means not having anywhere to go when I get off work. Trying to find someone to take me back and forth means finding someone willing to drive 80 miles a day (20 to get me to work, then they drive 20 back to go home, then another 20 to come get me, and then 20 to bring me home. The average vehicle gets about 20 miles to the gallon, and gas is about $3 a gallon, so right off the bat it's $12 a day in gas, plus at least another $20 for the trouble of driving me, that's $32 a day in transportation costs, and my average pay is about $10 an hour, which means about half my pay is going just to transportation. The only reason I've been able to make it to interviews is by getting up early and literally hitchhiking to town. They're usually in the afternoon, and everybody heads to their work in town early. A 2pm interview for me means getting up at 5am, putting interview clothes and hygiene supplies in my backpack, hitching a ride, and then changing and freshening up at the public library bathroom. Then when it's over I try and hitch back. i usually get home by 7pm. So I get up at 5am and get home around 7pm just to make it to a 2pm job interview that lasts 20-30 minutes, tops. Then there's my train wreck of a mother. It's always something with her. I've been homeless on the streets in the middle of winter, trying to work a full time job, and she's constantly calling me whining about how she doesn't have X or is out of Y, and she's worried about Z, and sobbing crocodile tears about how nobody cares, and I'm the only one who can help her, and I always do, which is why I remain homeless; because I don't make much money, but mom desperately needs whatever I have, just so she can turn around the next week and cozy up to her on again off again boyfriend, and mooch off of him. But then for some reason the next week, (my pay week), she's on the outs with him and once again I'm ""the only one who cares, and can help"" She's an alcoholic who keeps going back and forth with her abusive boyfriend. i've had several good restaurant jobs in the past, but they were places that had bars in them, and she makes a habit of turning my work into her hangout and get drunk spot, then she constantly makes a scene while she's drunk, and smarts off about how her son works there, and she can do whatever she wants, which leads to me getting fired. The unfortunate nick-name ""Norman Bates"" has followed me from several jobs. She doesn't have a license or vehicle, so she can't help me, and even if she did have, she wouldn't/couldn't help me because of her drinking. sometimes she's here at the house, most of the time she's at her boyfriend's. He will not help me. He's the typical redneck conservative who feels like I should already have a license, and it's my own fault for not being able to get one without any help from anyone, even though it is literally impossible to get a driver's license completely on your own. So I'm stuck at the house by myself most of the time. Food is sparse, and usually what I get is cheap and processed, mostly canned and frozen. My health has been declining as a result of the poor diet that has been forced upon me. Canned veggies are NOT as good for you as fresh. The only reason i have food is because when i hitch hike to town I visit the local food pantries. Once in a while mom throws me $20 to get food up here at the nearby dollar store. It's a 5 mile hike there and back. There's electricity and water here only because my Mom pays them for her disability records. She has to maintain her own residence to keep getting her disability, so she uses this place for that purpose, even though for all intents and purposes she lives with her boyfriend who makes thousands as an independent electrical contractor, and owns a house on 5 acres and has half a dozen vehicles at his disposal. He drinks all the time and is verbally and physically abusive to my mom, who puts up with it because he literally throws hundreds of dollars at her when he gets drunk. And Even though my mom's only here part time, I can't treat this place like it's mine. There's only one bedroom in this trailer, and I can't use it. I sleep on a comforter on the floor of the living room. When she's here, I have no privacy, and I can't do anything. She sits at the kitchen table all day on Facebook, worrying about what everyone else is doing, and commenting on it. If I try to watch something or play a video game, I can't have the sound on unless I wear headphones, and I can't wear headphones because she'll keep trying to talk to me about the dumb BS she finds on Facebook, while I have them on, and she gets pissed because I can't hear her. So when she's here, I basically have to sit and do nothing but wait to respond to her. i just don't know what to do anymore. I can't seem to find a day job to literally save my life. Everyday i get more and more depressed and hopeless, and endlessly bored. Nothing interests me anymore. Not video games, or movies, or anything on Netflix or YouTube. i endlessly scroll Reddit all day, everyday, seeing the same posts over and over. I'm always putting in job applications through Craigslist and Indeed. I can't get professional help with my depression and ADHD symptoms because i don't have any kind of insurance, and I'm broke. i have no family nearby that I can turn to except for the drunk mother. I \*want\* to go back to town, and be homeless but employed. I've done it before, and thrived, (until my mother enters the picture). I want to go back to town and get away from all of this shit, but I can't unless i have a job. That's the only missing ingredient, is a job. I don't even care about the hours because I have a tent, i can find a hiding spot in some woods outside town, and ride my bike to and from. I can talk to management about barring my mother from patronizing the place where I work. But it has to be a job i can \*do\* and I can't work the line, I tried, i was terrible. Maybe if i had the right training, and had more experience, i could do it, i don't know. I feel like I'm stuck, and I'm completely isolated which isn't helping anything. Maybe I just have to go back to town without a job lined up and do my best. I can't take much more of this. I've already tied a noose just in case. i just feel better having it around. It's my escape hatch. Honestly the only reason I haven't used it yet, or just bailed and gone to town is because she left her cat behind here with me. I care more about the cat than I do her, because if it weren't for the cat I'd be completely alone.",

308,"I'm ready to end my life soon.I'm 27 in a month, female, been severely depressed for 15 years and I have nothing to show for my years on earth. I didn't graduate high school because of depression. I don't have a GED because I always told myself I couldn't get it. I haven't worked in years, quit both of the jobs I have had because of depression. I can't drive because I'm afraid. I have self harm scars from the past that will never fade. For 5 years I was abused by a boyfriend physically and mentally. He almost killed me then I finally left, I wish he had. I have PTSD from him. My grandfather committed suicide and was an alcoholic for several years so I know where I got this from. I actually had a chance to be happy recently with a new guy but he turned out to be emotionally abusive according to some people. We had our whole futures planned out together, kid names, where we would live, I was in the process of moving in with him, his parents gave me their blessing...it was great. Then I initiated a fight because I was feeling bad mentally and he hasn't talked to me since. He left his pets at my place before going to Texas for work and he told me to rehome them even though we agreed that if we ever broke up they were his. I love them and it hurts to look at them. But meh, I was fucked up nearly this bad before the fight. I just lay in bed everyday and have substance abuse issues...alcohol and sleeping pills. My Mom has the same issue. I downed a whole bottle of vodka last night and blacked out, ruined my mattress by pissing myself twice but I'm too embarrassed to tell anyone. I have spent the past week unable to sleep unless I'm passout drunk, I kinda slept earlier I think for 30 minutes but it just made me have a realistic nightmare about my boyfriend/thing. I have been plagued with nightmares since I was a small child to the point that my Mom asked several doctors what to do and nothing could be done. I have been hospitalized in the past as a child for suicidal thoughts. I finally have a way out that will definitely work. It's honestly because I have no other options. I don't have health insurance, live in the US and going to a mental hospital will put me in debt for the rest of my life. Plus they don't actually help. They'll put me in a room by myself, cut off contact with everyone and give me MAYBE an hour of group therapy a day which means I won't talk because I hate groups and hand me a pill. How fucked up I am I know I would have to stay for a long time, hell, I might not even be suited for life outside of a hospital. Last therapist I had even said I needed hospitalization because the hour I got with her a week wasn't enough for someone so severe....then I lost her because I lost my health insurance. Lol Oh America. It's either death or debt forever and no actual help. Even the suicide hotline told me, ""Yeah your life sucks"" then disconnected with me.",

311,"Treated like shit - Ready to end my life.My life hasn't been easy... I attempted suicide first at age 8 by jumping in front of a car. Again at 15 with insulin overdose. Last time was 26 or so, overdose on opiates and antiemetics and tied a bag around my head. I spent 2 weeks in a coma in the ICU, but I swear I just can't die. I'm 34, a single parent of two sons... I've tried so hard to keep it together but I've been faking it every day, and I know they would be better off the sooner I am gone. I work in healthcare and have been bullied since day one, first for my sexuality, then progressed into more. About 20 people in total have been harassing me. I went to HR and they fired the homophobic nurse, but now the others are even worse. My manager told me a month ago that I'm getting a promotion and will be working at a different site because of the bullying. However, I haven't heard an update and when I asked timing, I was told ""in a few months"". I don't believe anything will change, and I can't have another day of this. I have been applying to other jobs for a year, but my career is in a very specific field with only 1-2 openings a year in medium sized cities like mine. I bought a house in March and have other bills to pay and have full custody of my sons, so I can't just leave my job. When I am dead, they will be in good hands with my mother. I'm so sorry to them, and I promise them they will be better when I'm gone, and they will get over it in time. But I can't keep living in misery day after day just to keep them happy. I'm posting here as a way to give myself permission. I know that suicide has always been the end of my path, I just didn't know when. Now I do, and I'm so relieved. I'm sorry boys.",
312,"Ready to end my lifeMy friend left me alone under a fucking nasty ass bridge. He never came back because he said it was something about his grandma. I though he was lying. I came home crying and screaming. I bashed my head against the wall. Then my dad. My fucking dad. My dad that hasn’t slept in 2 days. Said “what the hell is wrong with you” I told him what happened. He told me I could see this guy anymore. I continued to scream cry, he called me a two year old and said things like “I can’t believe you expect to be treated like and adult”. I cried in my room in a ball and he burst in my room and screamed “STOP CRYING NOW” it was the worst thing ever. I called my mom. She talked me off a ledge a bit. I’d kill myself if I could. The only way I could would be hanging which I’ve tried before and it never works. As I was typing this he came and my room and looked at him angrily and he said “don’t look at me like you wanna rip my heart out or something” fuck you dad. Fuck you from taking my best friend away from me. Fuck your for yelling at me while I was having a mental breakdown fuck you fuck your fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you FUCK YOU.

I'm sorry for the pain I'll cause, the pain that is to come for a lifetime, and the pain before this all. I know I wasn't easy to deal with, but I'm really grateful I had all of you guys to help me. I know you did the best you could do. Please don't think it wasn't enough. I was a lost cause enough as it was. Mom, Dad. I was raped when I was 14 by my boyfriend. You know who he is, so I won't name him. I never told you guys, because I was ashamed to. Now it's too late, and I feel like you should know. I feel like you should also know that my sister molested me when I was 4. I repressed it all of these years until I was 18. I still have flashbacks of it. I'm sorry, again, I never told you. I didn't know how to say it, and I didn't want to fuck things up. To my brother, I'm sorry I wasn't the best sister there was. I shut you out on a lot of my life, because I was afraid to show you all these sides of me. I was afraid to show you how mentally fucked up your sister was. I'm so sorry I never showed you. Please don't feel like you didn't do anything good, because you did. You did all you could do, and it was my fault I shut you out. You are the best big brother anyone could ask for, and I'm so happy I had you as a brother. I promise it won't hurt so much. I love you. To my friends and sorority, I know I told you all pf my struggles. I tried to keep with ritual, and do everything I could do to live life to the fullest and happiest. But I couldn't. I let you all down, and I'm sorry. ALAM. To banni. I know you're having a hard time with this now. I want you to know it wasn't your fault. It never was. You did the best you could do with what you had. You are mentally ill too, my love. You're halfway across the world. You did all you could, and I promise it was more than enough. I'm sorry I left you alone. I promised I never would. I promised I wouldn't jump from that building, but I hope you know why I did. I promise it wasn't your fault, nothing is. I loved you more than anything in this world, and I do believe we would have made beautiful children and had a long and happy life together. I know it hurts now, but in time it will be fine. I promise. Ich liebe dich, mein frosch. Finally, to myself. We did the best we can. Let's end this now, okay? Love Always, J",

320,"I feel ready to end my lifeMy life, at least since the age of 15, has been one of failure. My grades steadily declined in high school, and I feel I only graduated because of pity from my teachers; I had barely completed any homework assignments my senior year, including papers. College has been going terribly as well. I originally planned on attending a four-year school away from home, but my anxiety deterred me from such an endeavor, and I ended home less than a day after arriving at the dorms following a series of panic attacks. I started attending a local community college, but my eating disorder got to the point where I was admitted into the hospital for about eleven days, and I had to withdraw from classes that semester so as to pursue treatment. I was able to enroll in classes this semester, but I am unable to focus in class, and I can't stay focused enough to complete my homework assignments; all while displaying a facade of doing well to my family. I've been taking oxycodone pills from my mom irregularly in order to ease the pain. I'm not yet addicted, but I fear that drug addiction is an inevitability, as no antidepressant or mood-stabilizing drug I've been prescribed over the years as helped in the least. I greatly enjoy reading and writing, yet the latter enjoyment is one I feel I can not pursue, as I have absolutely nothing worthwhile to say, and I'm terrible at it. I have nothing to contribute to the world, and I feel ready to die.",
321,"I was right there, ready to end my lifeWhen I was much younger, maybe 12 years old, I was hit hard by depression. For the first time in my life, I was sad and nothing could make me feel better. My entire life, I had been a great kid. Sure, I talked back sometimes, but I was generally well-behaved and I always did extremely well in school. I was always one of the top kids in my class despite being nearly a year younger than most of my classmates (I had been sent to kindergarten a year earlier than I should've). Then I hit sixth grade. Then my youth and emotional immaturity caught up with me. I started to slip. I became disorganized, I didn't do homework, and when I did, I lost it and couldn't turn it in. I would physically make myself sick so I didn't have to go to school. For the first time, I was failing several classes, and my parents just seemed so disappointed. I would come home, and my mom would just look sad, with a ""what happened"" expression on her face. We decided not to tell my dad because we though I could turn it around and it'd be like it never happened. Near the third quarter of the year, my grades hadn't really improved that much, and my dad eventually found out. He was very mad at us, not for me failing school, but because we never told him. That was a mistake on our parts. I felt like I had betrayed my father, and let him down at the same time. He always told me to do my best, and now I just wasn't doing my best. I was falling down a dark spiral. Outside of school, the girl I had a major crush on was being friendly with another boy in my class, and it just pained me to see them laughing together. I never tried to tell her how I felt because I feared being humiliated and rejected (I still do, but that's not the point). I know it's pathetic to talk about my 12-year-old-self like I had a love life and all that, but at the time it seemed like such a big deal to me. I thought I loved this girl, and it brought me so much pain that I could never be with her. I also played football (American) through all this. I was a smaller kid, but I was always one of the strongest kids on the team, so I'd play on the offensive line and as a cornerback because of my quickness. I always wanted to play running back though. I was fast and I could get around the defenders so well. When I was put in one game during the 4th quarter when we had already blown the other team out, I was able to make every first down I was given the ball. I'd carry 4 or 5 kids bigger than me an extra 2-3 yards to cross that line. Despite this, I never got to play running back on the first line -- I was still stuck on the line. Then this new kid moves from another school and immediately gets put on the running back squad. I was crushed. My hopes and dreams of being a running back were squashed, and I started to blame myself for it. At home, my mother and father noticed I was changing. One time, I don't even remember the context, I just told my mother that I wished I was dead. She just looked at me and said ""don't you say that"" as her eyes filled with tears. I felt bad and blamed myself for making my mother sad. I felt like I was hurting everyone around me. I started having dreams where I hurt my brother, my best friends, and my family. I tried to suffocate myself with my bedsheets, but my mother came in my room to check on me and stopped me. She sat with me for a while until I was relaxed enough to go to bed. A few nights later, I woke up in the middle of the night after another bad dream. I thought to myself, *tonight is the night I end my life*. It's like 2:30 in the morning, and everyone else was asleep. I slowly crept downstairs into the kitchen, careful not to wake my father on the family room couch (he snored pretty loudly). I slowly pulled out the chef's knife that my mother used when she cooked for us. I just held it in my hand. I was ready to stab myself right through the chest. I thought about how I would be relieving myself and everyone around me, and I thought about what it might feel like to stab myself in the heart. Then my mind drifted, and I thought about what my mother would do when she woke up and saw me lying face down in a pool of my own blood with a knife in my chest. I couldn't bear that thought -- that look she would have on her face as she held her precious baby in her arms, cold and dead. I broke down and sobbed. I sat on the vinyl kitchen floor for 10 minutes and sobbed quietly. I then put the knife back and went back to my room. I cried myself to sleep, repeating ""I'm so sorry mommy"" to myself over and over again. Years later, I went to a therapist and we talked about my depression and what I could do to conquer it. After months and months of therapy, I was much better. Today, I am happier than ever before and so glad I decided to not throw my life away over my petty 12-year-old-self's problems. To those out there who think they're at the end of their rope, remember all the good things in your life and hold onto them. Remember the people who care about you and want to see you. Remember all the memories you have, and all the good things that will come in the future. When you're at the end of your rope, tie a knot and hold on.",

My posts get removed, I do not know why. Here is my situation, I posted about this on tifu and other subreddits. Throwaway account. This did not actually happen today, this has been a huge progressive fuck up that's been building up steam for months now. Please Reddit I need your help, and advice. Please! I've been married for 25 years, currently have 4 kids, and let me tell you when you've been married for this long, lot's of things can get into your head, shit rattles around there, echoes, ferments in a way that other's sometimes just can't comprehend. At times I feel blessed to have been married for so long, but at times living in here Tallahassee, in bum fuck Florida, in a shitty rental just gets to yea, you know? Sometimes the stresses of parenthood can be at times almost suffocating, I hope at least some of you out here, anyone really can just understand where I'm coming from. Working as an insurance broker living paycheck to paycheck wasn't my dream job, yet its the one I have to make due with, but I guess all this shit really started just after my 4th son was born, at home my relationship with my wife begun souring. Bills were piling up, and even after long hard days in the office my wife would yell, and cuss at me for wanting to smoke a pack of marlboro's, and drink some budweiser in peace in my living room, in the house I pay for like I always would but for some stupid ass reason she flipped on me. She began blue balling me since then, she stopped wanting to have fun in bed, time, and time again I would go to her, try to get it on like I had done before, and I just got no love from her, she acted like a cold hearted pasty white bitch, and not just when I was looking to get it on with her. But this pattern, this taboo purgatory I now found myself in, it was nothing temporary it became a new acceptance, a new reality, a new sign of defeat for me. Not only did I now have to put up with a shitty job, in a small home, where I couldn't even relax in peace like I used to, but now my wife was cutting me off from the little bit of pleasure I found being with her. I had dedicated nothing but my whole life, finances, everything I had to our family, and now this is the thanks I got. She would tell me to go, and play, and spend time with the kids like I hadn't, when she knew damn well I was exhausted after work at night times. So I decided from then on I had to do something about this set of unfortunate circumstances I now faced. Inspired to go have some fun, and have finally a release I well deserved; after work I began instead of going straight back to my prison of a home, I instead decided to go out to bars, nightclubs, telling my wife when she texted about where I was, that I was just burning the midnight oil, working hard filing paperwork, just making up job crap she wouldn't even look into anyways. At those clubs I had the time of my life. It became like an addiction to me. For weeks upon weeks I'd go to different nightclubs, and bar hop night after night after work, I didn't just savior my time there I indulged in it, there I'd hook up with women looking for more than just fun. For some reason during this time I was able to hook up with a few local black chicks that'd be hitting the club scene, never in my life did I ever think I as a blond ass kid from Pensacola would I be hooking up like this, most of the times after drinking, and chatting with them, we'd hang out in my car, and have some fun in a parking lot we'd drive to, and spend a few hours at, during this time I'd never use protection, maybe it was the combination of being drunk, or dazed but at that time I just didn't care. During this time I met this hot black chick with an afro, we'll call her ""Mandy"", and after dancing with her at a nightclub late one night we really hit it off, but after my typical one night stand, this girl was different. We grew to have a connection, as days went by we started getting flirty over texts, and soon I grew to have a secret relationship with her, while my wife knew nothing about it. I even took several ""business trips"" to her place during this time. Every time I went it was well worth it. At first she was very sweet to me, and considerate, we even smoked pot together, which for me was a first. Finally for once in my life I thought I had found the perfect work life, sex balance. I'd wake up, say bye to the kids, go to work, afterwards let loose at the clubs till 3am, come back while the wife is asleep, and so on. And finally with Mandy in the mix, I had someone to actually connect to when I wanted. Unlike my wife she was in her early 20s, my wife late 40s, I've seen garbage fires that look better than her. Mandy always gave excellent blowjobs, its like she had lips of an angel, unlike my wife who never gave me oral. But that's when everything went to shit. Mandy came to me two weeks ago, and stated she's pregnant. She took a test, and showed me the results. I don't know what to do, I can't let my wife, or kids find out. Mandy is threatening to tell my wife, about her, and the baby. She has been calling he angrily about this, she blames me for her pregnancy, but she wants to keep that baby. She tells me she doesn't want to be ""just the other woman."" She doesn't want to be ""a dirty little secret."" I don't know what to do. I got so angry at that fucking bitch, we got into a heated argument. I haven't been going to work for the past few days now, I've been making sure Mandy doesn't come to my house, if she does, I'm thinking of calling the cops on that thug. I can't let my wife, or my kids know the truth. I need your help, please, what should I do? I need help, and advice. I want to save the marriage, I can't let my kids go through a divorce, my wife still does not know anything. I hate this whole fucking situation. I hate my life, why the hell would this happen to me?? How can I convince Mandy not to tell my wife? I don't know what to do, should I get a restraining order on her? Please help me anyone, I don't know who to go to for help. TL:DR had several affairs with women I met at nightclubs, hit it off really well with one, now she's pregnant, and wants to tell my wife! Please help me, I don't want to live anymore, I'm thinking of running off, maybe buying a shotgun. Where can I turn to? Help please anyone. My life is worthless. I feel numb inside.",
335,"To the teenage stranger who got two buses with me to ensure I got home safe.We met one night on the back of the top deck of a bus in the winter of 2007 - I was 12 and earlier that day I found myself in a cab with a man almost 3 times my age, driving to a part of the city I’d never been to before. We arrived at this dirty cramped apartment where there was two men waiting for me. I knew what was expected, this wasn’t the first time I’d been out with this man and this wasn’t the first apartment he’d taken me to but this time I was tired and scared and was still in pain from the last time but as expected shortly after I arrived I was led upstairs by the oldest of the three men. While sitting on the side of the bed I tried to stall, talking too much, taking way too long to untie my shoes and unbutton my coat etc all the while buying time just waiting for the two men downstairs to leave and finally they did and I saw my chance. I jumped up to run but this man who was a lot taller than me caught me and turned me around to face him while holding my wrists in the air as he laughed at my attempt to escape. I was trapped and so I did the first thing I could think of, I jumped up and smashed my head into his mouth hitting his teeth and cutting my head in the process but it forced him to let go of me as he grabbed his mouth and I ran as fast as I could. And so here I was 12 years of age running through the outskirts of the city at about 10:30pm trying to find a bus stop to get home and when I did, I waited there silently sobbing in the middle of winter with blood on my head, no shoes and no coat, just terrified that at any moment that man might come after me but thankfully he didn’t and I got on that bus and went upstairs to one of the seats close to the back of the bus. At this point I had passed multiple people on the streets, about 3 more people passed me waiting at the bus stop and also once the bus arrived I passed the driver who didn’t so much as look up when I was getting in and about 5 people down stairs and a further 3 people upstairs who completely ignored me. Most of them were grown adults. I felt alone, afraid and completely invisible until you stood up from your seat at the back of the bus and came and sat down next to me. Bless you, you were only about 16 you must have been clueless but you done all the right things, took my hand and brought me to the back seat away from the stares of others, put your arm around my shoulders as I cried into your chest, tried to clean the blood from my head with your sleeve, gave me your hoodie and offered to call the police but respected my choice when I said no. You were a guardian angel I needed but didn’t think I deserved. I say that because not only did you do all that, you got off the bus with me in the middle of the city and I tried to give your hoodie back as you asked where I was going. I told you I needed to walk to a different bus stop to get another bus home and your exact words were “that’s mad I’m getting that bus too” and we walked to the bus stop and got on this second bus together and once again we went up to the back of the bus by this point I had stopped crying and had cleaned myself up a bit with your hoodie as you tried to make me laugh, all while not asking too many questions about how I got into this mess which I greatly appreciated. Then my stop arrived and I got up to leave and you said “I’m meant to get off at the next stop but I’ll get off here and we can walk together”, this was perfectly fine with me because despite what men had done to me up until this point, with you I felt safe. We got off the bus, and we walked towards my house and as we got closer I returned your hoodie, gave you a hug, thanked you and turned down the road to my house. It wasn’t until later when I thought back on that night that I realized, you didn’t get up to get off the bus in the city until I did, and you were “getting that bus too” yet when walking to the bus stop you almost made a wrong turn and didn’t know the number of the bus when it was coming down the road, and when you got off a stop early to walk with me we didn’t walk towards the next stop we walked back and around the corner further from the next bus stop you were suppose to be at. Im guessing you were never going my way, probably not even going as far as the city and yet you did all that because you could just tell that I needed it, I just needed somebody to notice me, to care for me and you did that for me. I never got your name and I never seen you again after that and yet in those two hours, two bus journeys, you changed the course of my life. When I was at that first bus stop i was getting ready to end my life, knew were the tablets were and intended to take them all while my mom slept that night, your intervention changed that, gave me hope and a want to live! That cut on my head left me with a small scar but instead of remembering what those men did, every time I looked in the mirror and seen it I thought of you, it gave me strength when I had none and helped me though some really dark times. It’s 13 years later now and I’ve completed over 2 years of counseling, I’ve got a college degree, a well paid career with great future prospects, I’m planning on buying my own house next year with enough room for plenty of animals and I’m happier than I could have ever imagined, and none of this would have ever happened if it wasn’t for the selfless act of your teenage self . So thank you, I can truly say that I owe you my life and wherever you are in the world I hope you have the best life possible because you deserve the very best. EDIT: thank you all so much for your lovely supportive replies. this is something that was very difficult for me to share but I did so in the hopes that the boy from that night might see it and know the impact he had on my life but in the mean time you all ensured I had no reason to fear, it’s so uplifting to feel the love from you all and not have anyone judge me for the situation I got myself into. Also: without revealing much information as I would like to remain anonymous I would ask that if this story sounds familiar to you and if that night you were a young teenage boy with spiked black hair and I blue zipped hoodie that ended up covered in blood, please message me, I would love to thank you personally for what you did for me that night EDIT2: reposting without heart emoji as last post was removed",

337,"I’m almost ready to die, every day makes me feel closer to being able to be brave enough to end my lifeI’ve spent so long living day by day, year by year, trying to fix how I am and who I am. Pretending I could be better, that I could get better. But I can’t. I’m broken. I’m not a real human being, I’m a sad pathetic man with nothing that wasn’t handed to me automatically. I’m 27 now. No friends. Virgin who’s never had a girlfriend. Never had a job. My brain is fucked and I can’t be normal no matter how much I wish I could be. I can’t enjoy anything. Distractions are the best things can be to me now, mainly watching tv and film and pretending I don’t exist. Food tastes like ash. Sleep is the only time I feel ok. I sleep a lot. Even the nightmares are better than being awake. The anti depressants have just made me feel numb, with the bonus of making my dick not work. So I can’t even jerk off now. One of the few pleasures I had left. Sometimes I sit at a coffee shop, and watch all the people walking by. Couples. Workers. Teens. The elderly. I wish I could be like them, I wish I could have relationships. I wish I could kiss a girl who loves me. I wish I could have sex with someone attracted to me. I wish I could work a job. I wish I didn’t need pills to stop anxiety making me wanna vomit from basic human interaction. I wish I could hang out with friends and talk. I wish I didn’t have so many failures and zero successes. This isn’t how human beings are meant to live. I’ve planned a pretty good method to end my life, just need to visit some people who care about me so I can say goodbye in my own way, hopefully it’ll give them some measure of closure when they think back. Think I’ll also write a note to let them all know that none of it was their fault and there was nothing they could have done to stop me ending things. I hope I have the courage to end my life soon. I hate living like this.",

340,"On the 15th of Jan I was ready to end it all.On the 15th of Jan I was completely ready to end my life. I wrote my suicide notes in both English and Arabic, I've set an auto post on my Facebook. I was going to go on with it without a doubt, I had my medication that I was going to OD on and I was also ready to self-harm myself, but I didn't. I stopped half way through, crying so hard I did want the people that loved me to feel what I was feeling, I didn't want them to suffer nor blame themselves like I blame myself for my best friend's suicide. I felt that is wasn't fair to do that to them even though ending it all will end my pain but it will only start the pain of others and I don't want that. I don't want to hurt people, even though I don't deserve anything and everything they have given me it's not fair for them to carry my burden with them. I still don't know how I managed to stop myself, I have thoughts everyday of how I'm going to do it but I stop every time because I don't want to hurt people.

But I am ready for death. This is, it's really something I can't explain. I've felt this way just for a short while. But I feel as if I'm going to die soon, but not by my own hands. Nor anyone elses. I don't understand why I feel this way. My life is going great. I'm actually going to the doctors tomorrow for an exam, and I have this feeling they're going to discover something terrible. But it's funny, because I know they will. How? I don't know. I don't know how to explain it. I don't feel guilty or bad, I just accept it for what it is. Part of me wishes it was me being paranoid. But I know that isn't it. If you asked me to fully describe how I feel, I feel like I'm ready to go home. Weird isn't it?",
343,"[Vent] I'm scared for the end of my dogs life, and I'll never be ready or able to cope with it.I rescued my 2 dogs when they were 5 and (guessing) 3. I'm losing track of time honestly, but I reckon that makes my Lab 11 now, and my Husky 8. From the moment I got them, I was in love. They are my best friends/family/kids. I know you all are the same, but I take it to another level - partly due to a traumatic experience which I just can't shake. There was a period of 19 months in the middle of that where I didn't have them due to a bitter ""divorce"". MY defacto ex committed fraud and stole them both and used them as pawns, and I had to sacrifice everything I had to get them back. ALL my money, and almost every moment of that time was spent researching legal principles, and trying to figure out how to see them again, and wondering what I did to deserve it. During that time, in addition to crushing depression, I'd have the most vivid nightmares. One of them involved her deciding to ""split"" them. But we weren't taking one each (as she was trying to do in real life). In this dream, she got the heads, and I got the bodies. It wasn't a dream where that somehow made sense and they were ok. They were dead. It was graphic. In the dream, I had to go to court (which is what I was really facing) to try to put them back together and bring them back to life. I woke up in tears, and it took a few minutes to realise it wasn't real. I'd like to say that kind of thing is behind me, because it sort of is. The happy ending is that after a 19 month, expensive, painful struggle, she gave them back (to avoid the court action and financial consequences), and they've been with me ever since. But you don't just get over that, and it's left me with lasting mental health issues in general, but largely about the dogs. I actually think I might have PTSD. In the first few months of getting them back, I was elated. I actually hadn't been able to work much leading up to that anyway due to crippling depression, and directing my energy and resources to self representing in court. But once I got them back, all I wanted to do was be with them. I am a freelance photographer and took the odd job if it came my way, but I didn't try to find any new work. I didn't care. All I wanted was to reconnect with my dogs - my kids. That's STILL all I want. I'm working more now because I have to, but the more I do, the less I get to see them, and the more I develop a new fear - that particularly with my Lab, I may not have long left. My Husky is perfect. Could pass for a puppy. And other than being a slight chonker, my lab is in great health. He still chases my Husky in short bursts, walks every day, and other than a few old people things like creaky joints, he's fine. I wouldn't be surprised if he lasted 6 or 7 more years. I know death is something all dog owners face. It's a given, and I knew what I was signing up for. If none of the above had ever happened, I'd still be devastated when that day came. But after what I went through... I'm legitimately terrified that I'll wake up one morning and he won't, or that I'll have to make an impossible decision. I don't even know which is worse. But it's on my mind way too often considering I have no reason to think it's going to happen any time soon. It's irrational to think about right now, but I just can't get it out of my mind. Sometimes I look at them, and out of nowhere, I just for some reason involuntarily imagine what it would be like without them (sort of remembering how it was when I didn't have access to them at all), and I go stone cold. And it's happening more and more. I can't lose them again, but I know that I will. I know I should just enjoy the time we have now, and believe me, I am. Parks, beaches, play, treats, and I have barely taken a photo or video of a subject besides them in over a year. I'm kind of socially awkward and weird about it now. I prefer them to most human contact, which is how it was before. ;) But x 10. Travel that takes me away from them for more than a few days scares the shit out of me and I actively avoid it. My ageing parents live interstate and I haven't been home since I got them back. My parents came to me once though, and I'm hoping that I can find 3-5 days early in the new year to get home - but once upon a time, travel was my life and a week was a short trip, and a month was average. But now... I'm trying to find ways to make trips go as fast as possible or avoid them entirely - all because I can't be away from them. I'm single, and if a girl invites me over, my first thought is that I don't want to leave the dogs alone for the night. If she meets them and doesn't go crazy for them, or doesn't want to share the bed with them, she's out. No joke. I can't be apart from them, and I can't form attachments with people who don't get it. And you know what? That's extreme, but that's ok with me. I've done my travel. I have some good people around me who can take care of the dogs for short periods so I can see my family and friends back home, which is the only thing that could make me want to get on a plane right now. And I like to think that ""My girl"" would find my love for them endearing. She'd be the same about her dogs, or would adopt mine with me and we'd live happily ever after. All that is to say that these dogs... they're everything to me. My life revolves around them, and I think largely because of what happened, it goes well beyond ""loving my dogs"" and more towards I am genuinely petrified of the day when I lose them and my entire world crumbles... again, and I'll be back in that dark place I was when I was without them, only with no hope of a return. And it's not if, it's when. And I don't know what to do.",

I've posted for help, and I don't know where to turn to now.I've posted about my current situation in other subreddits asking for advice, people don't believe me. I don't know what to do. Here is my situation, I posted about this on tifu. Throwaway account. This did not actually happen today, this has been a huge progressive fuck up that's been building up steam for months now. Please Reddit I need your help, and advice. Please! I've been married for 25 years, currently have 4 kids, and let me tell you when you've been married for this long, lot's of things can get into your head, shit rattles around there, echoes, ferments in a way that other's sometimes just can't comprehend. At times I feel blessed to have been married for so long, but at times living in here Tallahassee, in bum fuck Florida, in a shitty rental just gets to yea, you know? Sometimes the stresses of parenthood can be at times almost suffocating, I hope at least some of you out here, anyone really can just understand where I'm coming from. Working as an insurance broker living paycheck to paycheck wasn't my dream job, yet its the one I have to make due with, but I guess all this shit really started just after my 4th son was born, at home my relationship with my wife begun souring. Bills were piling up, and even after long hard days in the office my wife would yell, and cuss at me for wanting to smoke a pack of marlboro's, and drink some budweiser in peace in my living room, in the house I pay for like I always would but for some stupid ass reason she flipped on me. She began blue balling me since then, she stopped wanting to have fun in bed, time, and time again I would go to her, try to get it on like I had done before, and I just got no love from her, she acted like a cold hearted pasty white bitch, and not just when I was looking to get it on with her. But this pattern, this taboo purgatory I now found myself in, it was nothing temporary it became a new acceptance, a new reality, a new sign of defeat for me. Not only did I now have to put up with a shitty job, in a small home, where I couldn't even relax in peace like I used to, but now my wife was cutting me off from the little bit of pleasure I found being with her. I had dedicated nothing but my whole life, finances, everything I had to our family, and now this is the thanks I got. She would tell me to go, and play, and spend time with the kids like I hadn't, when she knew damn well I was exhausted after work at night times. So I decided from then on I had to do something about this set of unfortunate circumstances I now faced. Inspired to go have some fun, and have finally a release I well deserved; after work I began instead of going straight back to my prison of a home, I instead decided to go out to bars, nightclubs, telling my wife when she texted about where I was, that I was just burning the midnight oil, working hard filing paperwork, just making up job crap she wouldn't even look into anyways. At those clubs I had the time of my life. It became like an addiction to me. For weeks upon weeks I'd go to different nightclubs, and bar hop night after night after work, I didn't just savior my time there I indulged in it, there I'd hook up with women looking for more than just fun. For some reason during this time I was able to hook up with a few local black chicks that'd be hitting the club scene, never in my life did I ever think I as a blond ass kid from Pensacola would I be hooking up like this, most of the times after drinking, and chatting with them, we'd hang out in my car, and have some fun in a parking lot we'd drive to, and spend a few hours at, during this time I'd never use protection, maybe it was the combination of being drunk, or dazed but at that time I just didn't care. During this time I met this hot black chick with an afro, we'll call her ""Mandy"", and after dancing with her at a nightclub late one night we really hit it off, but after my typical one night stand, this girl was different. We grew to have a connection, as days went by we started getting flirty over texts, and soon I grew to have a secret relationship with her, while my wife knew nothing about it. I even took several ""business trips"" to her place during this time. Every time I went it was well worth it. At first she was very sweet to me, and considerate, we even smoked pot together, which for me was a first. Finally for once in my life I thought I had found the perfect work life, sex balance. I'd wake up, say bye to the kids, go to work, afterwards let loose at the clubs till 3am, come back while the wife is asleep, and so on. And finally with Mandy in the mix, I had someone to actually connect to when I wanted. Unlike my wife she was in her early 20s, my wife late 40s, I've seen garbage fires that look better than her. Mandy always gave excellent blowjobs, its like she had lips of an angel, unlike my wife who never gave me oral. But that's when everything went to shit. Mandy came to me two weeks ago, and stated she's pregnant. She took a test, and showed me the results. I don't know what to do, I can't let my wife, or kids find out. Mandy is threatening to tell my wife, about her, and the baby. She has been calling he angrily about this, she blames me for her pregnancy, but she wants to keep that baby. She tells me she doesn't want to be ""just the other woman."" She doesn't want to be ""a dirty little secret."" I don't know what to do. I got so angry at that fucking bitch, we got into a heated argument. I haven't been going to work for the past few days now, I've been making sure Mandy doesn't come to my house, if she does, I'm thinking of calling the cops on that thug. I can't let my wife, or my kids know the truth. I need your help, please, what should I do? I need help, and advice. I want to save the marriage, I can't let my kids go through a divorce, my wife still does not know anything. I hate this whole fucking situation. I hate my life, why the hell would this happen to me?? How can I convince Mandy not to tell my wife? I don't know what to do, should I get a restraining order on her? Please help me anyone, I don't know who to go to for help. TL:DR had several affairs with women I met at nightclubs, hit it off really well with one, now she's pregnant, and wants to tell my wife! Please help me, I don't want to live anymore, I'm thinking of running off, maybe buying a shotgun. Where can I turn to? Help please anyone. My life is worthless.",
347,"4 year anniversary & speaker shareHi room: I'm celebrating 4 years of back-to-back sobriety from alcohol and addictive sex/love behaviors!!! What a fucking miracle that I am alive, want to be alive, and am living sober. I'm speaking in one of my communities which requests scripts (because of online medium) and I thought I'd share it here for anyone who is interested... It's focused on sex/love but, eh, I think one addictive banana is just a part of the whole bunch. And it's 12-step focused. That's definitely not the only path and it's not even my only path (I also like Buddhist recovery and I've benefited from a generous helping of medical assistance) but, it's the speaker share I wrote, so I'd love to share it with y'all. I wish everyone a contented sober day with enough pain to want to change and enough courage to get it done. xo \- With a lot of joy, a little disbelief, and tremendous gratitude, I celebrated 4 years of back-to-back sobriety from sex and love addiction two days ago. (My sobriety date is January 13, 2016.) I will use the typical 12 step speaker format of what it was like, what happened, and what it’s like now. I would also like to suggest not only to the newcomer, but also to the old-timer, and everyone in between, to practice open-mindedness in listening today. With any story—whether I participated in those behaviors and thoughts or didn’t—there will be things that I can relate with and things that I cannot. It is my responsibility to find the commonality, take what I can for today, and leave the rest to think about later. So, about me, and what happened. I had a challenging childhood. I believe two early attachment ruptures contributed to my addiction. I also believe my paternal genetic lineage of mental illness, alcoholism, and completed suicide contributed to my addiction. In short, by the time I was about 7, the slingshot of addiction was loaded and pulled back. So I’m 7 and I start having “boyfriends”. The difference between my “boyfriends” and those of my classmates was, I believe, my obsession and the feeling in my chest of wanting to be loved and consumed, even from a young age. I remember once being in the car having broken up with one 7-year-old “boyfriend” and I said “I am so free now! I can do what I want!” Love addict early on. From 7 to 12 I was having these non-sexual but fantasized-about boyfriends in school and on the bus and on the street. At 12 I discovered my first drug: my asthma inhaler. I also discovered lying. I did not tell my parents why I needed so many inhalers—practicing addicts are remarkably selfish and I did not care that they were expensive, but of course I was also a child without much ability to take perspective—I just lied that they went off randomly in my backpack. I discovered my first drug and I also started drinking. So now I’m 13 and I have discovered drugs, alcohol, and “older boys”, which leads me to my first real sexual experience while drinking straight, cheap vodka from water bottles at a public swimming pool with an older boy. I had both the “sex” and “love” aspects of sex and love addiction, though they would eventually intertwine. When I was 14 I was in a relationship with a boy whom I fantasized that I would marry and I had sex for the first time—he was 4 years my senior. When I was 15 he “ghosted me” and I could not understand, I called him obsessively, and this obsessive calling became a hallmark feature of my love addiction. At about age 15 I began running, playing sports, and engaging in bulimia (purging and exercise). Now the trifecta had come to fruition and that addiction slingshot—which had been loaded and pulled back from a young age—fired, with no undo button. So here’s the addictive trifecta for me: boys, booze, bulimia. I wanted love, I would go out on weekends as a teenager, drink to blackout, which lessened my shame, helped my social anxiety, and allowed me to do things I was otherwise ashamed of. I would wake up, obsess about the guy(s) from before, they would naturally not care, and then I would binge and purge to make myself feel better. I would feel fat, and need a partner to ""love"" me, and tell me I was pretty. I used physical sex as a placeholder for love and being told I’m pretty. So the next time I could, I would do the cycle again. And this occurred from ages 15 – 26. Within that timeframe I had many accomplishments: graduating high school with honors, year-long relationships, graduating college summa cum laude, working at a highly prestigious university... I also had many challenges: several medical withdrawals, growing suicidality as part of bipolar disorder, social isolation, constant misery, liver malfunction, incurable STI’s (two of them), online and camera acting out, unbearable shame, panic attacks every day towards the end. I always felt like I was not enough, or worse, I was too much, annoying, and you were going to leave me, and then I would die. I had no friends. By this point I’m 26 and I am ready to end my life because to continue in this way is futile. I had yet another blackout night culminating in a dehumanizing one-night-stand.Mind you—I joined 12 step programs when I was 19 (food related) then 20 (alcohol) then 24 (SLAA) so I was convinced that nothing would work for me. I had already tried sponsors, the steps, I couldn’t stay sober to save my life (literally), and I was ready to die. I was so low that the only reason I didn’t enact my plan was it would halt public transportation, and I didn’t want my death to ruin anyone’s work commute. I called my psychiatrist because I trusted her, and I didn’t know what to do. On January 13, 2016 she met me at the hospital and had me admitted into a dual-diagnosis unit. That means I am formally diagnosed with addiction and mental illness. Here I was well-medicated and a straight-shooting nurse told me, “If you drink, you will die.” I said , ""No no no you don’t get it, I’ve already done AA, I’ve already done all this stuff, it doesn’t work."" She replied, “I don’t care what you do or don’t do, you just can’t drink.” So I spent two weeks in this dual-diagnosis unit where I engaged in intrigue with other patients. I decided to stop drinking alcohol through self-will and would fix my life through becoming the perfect worker, the perfect employee, and would work myself into a better life. Three months later I’m at my next psychiatric ward, again suicidal. Those three months of intensive professional work and white-knuckle sobriety (alcohol and sex and love) did not fix the fundamental problem which for me I believe is existential, spiritual… I believe my fundamental problem is NOT that I act out, or that I have the wrong partner, or that I don’t have a partner, or that the sex isn’t this way, or that I'm not loved the right way… I believe my fundamental problem is that I have a god-shaped hole in my chest that I try to shove full of addictive content, but it will never feel whole and full that way and it will continue consuming and consuming until I give it the right sustenance, which is connection. So after my second psychiatric ward stay I realized inwardly what it says in the book Alcoholics Anonymous (also known as the Big Book) that I was “unable to imagine life either with alcohol or without it” (pg. 165). I tried drinking and grabbing at love which landed me in the psych ward. I tried abstaining which landed me in the psych ward. I realized that, as the Big Book says on that same page, the fellowship of the spirit was what would bring me contentment, joy, and meaning. At this point I became deadly serious about surrender. The basics of early recovery for me included: no-contact with men (more than 6 months), no relationships (about one year), daily meetings and stepwork. The basic purpose of not talking to men has nothing to do with gender or gender identity. It is that I needed to stop using sex, flirtation, and intrigue as social currency. With women, I had to be a real person to find friendship and camaraderie, and so I developed a community of women. “Time takes time” is a wonderful motto. I took this time in early recovery to stabilize myself physically, to orient myself as a 12-stepper, and to dig deep into spiritual reflection through stepwork. I have had many wonderful sponsors over time. The worst of my sponsors told me what to do and tried to control me. I now know, this is totally natural for an addict to do, but it is not the way to a spiritual awakening. The best of my sponsors taught me to take inventory, trust, pray, meditate, and practice selfless service. They put my hand into the god-hand. The best of my sponsors used the Basic Text and Big Book to lift me up towards god, rather than to beat me down into a false humility. Ultimately I did find more and more of what I wanted in recovery: the dignity of choice, open-minded and curious spiritual exploration, freedom from addiction. Most of all I grew over time to authentically love myself. I love this line from our SLAA Basic Text at the end of Chapter 5, The Withdrawal Experience: “Amidst all difficulties and uncertainties, a simple intimacy had come into being for us: we had met ourselves, and found ourselves worthy. We had become “beloved” to ourselves.” When I was in my addiction, I could not fathom finding myself worthy. I had a whole host of bad names for myself and reasons why I wasn’t acceptable, which fueled my need to find another person to tell me I was acceptable, and to pump that god-shaped hole in my heart full of addictive garbage. I wasn’t worth it, so why would I care? Yet, today, I am worth it, and I have internalized the love so freely given me in SLAA and other 12-step rooms. To the newcomer who wants a suggestion—I suggest identifying people with whom you won’t use sex and social currency, and developing recovery community with them based in honesty and integrity. I suggest working the steps over and over and over again: “time takes time” and these spiritual lessons are not quick to learn. I suggest staying sober, because if you can relate with me...you probably need it to stay alive. On the practical topic of bottom lines, each of us will have our own, so I'll share about just my main one: I don’t practice infidelity. Infidelity is any behavior which I would not do in front of my partner (from sex to secret messages to long hugs). To my inner addict, that is a radical, impossible standard! But it is possible in recovery. Today I am sober from bottom lines in SLAA, alcohol and related substances in AA for 4 years. I have an amazing romantic partner, we are planning a life together. I have a cat who has never seen me drink! :D I am close with my family. I am still reactive, angry, and selfish—but not nearly as much and not nearly as frequently. I have faith. I am special, but not unique. What a fun freedom: to love myself without narcissism, to love you without abandoning myself. The freedom of recovery is yours, too, should you choose to pursue it. Remember to pause to hear the quiet voice of god. Find your recovery tribe—stay in the middle of the herd. Quit filling the god-shaped hole with garbage, one day at a time. You deserve better, I know it even if you're not sure yet. Start filling yourself with faith as you understand faith. You can find it taking the 12 steps. And, for you and for me, more will be revealed.",

349,"My life-long best friend ended our friendship, and I’m finally ready to talk about it.*TL;DR - Best friend of 18yrs ended our relationship after telling me I was going to be his best man, ghosts me for months, then tells me our beliefs and ideals are different I’m uninvited to the wedding and good luck with my life.* This happened this past May, and I’ve thought about it every single day since then. He and I first met in 1st grade just about 18 years ago through a mutual friend at a birthday party. We immediately hit it off, the whole traditional best friend type stuff of every weekend at one another’s house, going on vacations together, being called family, spending the entire summers together, etc... We were both there for the relationship up and downs, the whole puberty thing where we were going some real weird shit - essentially we were attached at the hip and were “best friends”. In high school, about 10th grade he moved away to another state but was close enough to visit during the summers. This didn’t really stop our relationship and we both skyped, texted, and instant messaged through various gaming platforms. Video games became a huge part of our relationship, each and every weekend consisted of Skype calls lasting 5-8 hours all while playing games online and learning the ins and outs of coding. We kept our relationship strong even though there was distance between us. College came around, we moved further away and eventually stopped the weekend Skyped and stuff but still managed to text each other quite often. Everyday grew to every other day, then that grew to every week to every other week and so on until it was every once in awhile. I felt like nothing changed, we still talked easily and conversation never felt labored. The end of our college career was marked by his proposal to his girlfriend I thirdwheeled with for years. After the deal was done he texted me “proposed to her and she said yes, get your measurements for your tux!”. Dope, the whole wedding thing as best friends was expected by both of our families, me being the best man and watching my best friend marry the love of his life. Time started passing and I never got an update for the wedding, but managed to get my measurements and stuff ready on my end. Conversation passed as usual, but the wedding was never mentioned which I thought was weird but let it slide. Months go by, and I start getting worried about being out of the loop. It’s now 2 months before the wedding. (Texting) Me: hey dude! Hope your midterm went well. Kind of out of the loop with the wedding, I have my measurements. What do I need to do? Him (a couple days later): Hey. So I should have been more clear, there’s a reason you haven’t heard anything or received a wedding invitation. He goes on to explain that we’ve drifted apart and our relationship wasn’t what it used to be. He felt our conversations were labored (I didn’t) and how our “beliefs and ideals” are different than one another. He then wished me luck in life and basically said good bye. That was the last I heard of him, I sent a text congratulating him and I expressed my confusion but understanding. No reply. This has been incredibly hard, I still don’t believe it’s real and I cry often about it.",
350,"my life isnt the best and im ready for it to end Hi, You don’t know me and I don't know you and I hope it stays that way. I don’t think I'm cut out for the world. There's too much pressure on my shoulders. I’m cracking from it. I find that im just bored. Kinda empty. I feel lonely in a world filled with millions of people. I just don’t think i’m really cut out for life. I’m not attractive, i’m not rich, my genetics suck ass. I don’t think i’m going anywhere. I guess I'll tell you about my life and views. I don’t think im gonna last past 20. Hell im 13 and im already struggling. I come from a family of 8. Mom dad sister sister me sister brother baby brother. My parents don’t live in the same house anymore. I think it’s my fault. I hated my dad. He always yelled, screamed and beat me ( he still yells and screams but physical discipline has gone down for me my baby brother not so much but thats different). I hated his yelling. And i still do. It’s overwhelming and makes me feel really bad. My mom is sweet but she can be a bit manipulative. My older sister sucks. I hate her a lot. In fact i hate all of my family. Except for my baby brother for now. I love him with my heart. The only reason i think my dad is so yelly and strict is because of my sister ( the oldest). 2-3 years ago my sister decided she was gonna make hell for our family. When my parents went to work for the summer we were supposed to clean the house. Instead she’d lock us out of her room and have sex with one of her friends. My second older sister revealed this to my family later after she went under surgery. It was a huge deal at the time, but I don't remember much information. After that she got caught smoking weed in the bathroom. I still remember my dad running into the room ( I was in the room with her and other sister) with a belt. And I covered my head because for some reason I thought he was going to hit me. He hit her a lot with the belt even though she said stop but idk. My grandma later took my older sister into “custody”. That's when my moms side of the family began hating my dads side. My older sister later got caught having cut marks on her arms and got sent away to this camp. And not gonna lie i want to be sent to a camp like that just to get away from my family. Currently there's two houses my moms and my dads. My dad's house is old and tacky. The sink is leaking and there's a moldy tin beneath it. There's ants, spiders, everywhere. There's mushrooms growing beneath the sink. It just overall doesn't look nice and i'm embarrassed of it. My mom's house is nicer and more touched up but there are a lot more people living in the house to help with rent. It was just supposed to be me, mom, 2nd oldest sister, youngest sister, brother, baby brother and my cousin. My moms friend got evicted and shes staying in the room i'm supposed to stay in. my uncle is there too along with my oldest sister whos supposed to be in college but we can’t afford it so she currently is not attending. I dislike my family for a lot of reasons. They are loud, very harsh and critical and it sucks. I have very low self esteem already and their comments on my looks and the clothes I wear are very destructive. Comments like “you hair is so nappy” “why do you look like that” “what are you wearing” “you look hideous” it just hurts. And maybe these words don’t affect you but they affect me. They may not know it, but I hate myself. I’m just really unattractive and my popularity suffers from it. I don’t even know who I am anymore. Its like even when I find someone who has a couple things in common with me, I'm never gonna find where I truly belong. I'm too weird and I hate it. Today's society is all about luscious curves and full hips. Meanwhile i have very small narrow hips that are smaller than my shoulders. Im skinny and muscular and can’t wear the clothes I want to wear. I only wear bagging clothes. Clothes that don't show the figure. I don't go to the pool anymore. And if I do go to the pool I always wear a long shirt over my bikini or don’t go in the water. I don’t know why im just so hideous. It’s like nothing im doing is working. I've tried working out, subliminals, nothing just nothing and nothing. Just things have become so empty and hopeless. My family doesn't even care about me. They keep forgetting about me. I’m the one person in the house who needs clothes and shoes. My entire wardrobe should not fit in the same drawer. I know there are people who are less fortunate than me and have no clothes but that doesn't make it suck any less. I go to school surrounded by rich people. And I can't help but look at myself and wonder what i'm doing wrong. It's like everyday people around me are happy and living their best life meanwhile im just existing. In fact i'm barely doing that. It sucks so much. I’m in the gifted art program for virginia. My family expects so much of me. They are expecting me to go to college with scholarships from art dance and music and all that and it's overwhelming. I don’t even know what I want to be when I get older yet everyone around me seems to have a goal and is so close to it. Everyone around me has a huge social media platform. Everyone around me is so successful and looking into a bright future. I don’t even know if i'm gonna be there in the future. I don’t want to be. I'm just tired of living on this earth. The earth where its a burden for me to be an african american. It's so terrifying for me. I gave my family members telling me stories of how they've been mistreated by society and it makes me nervous. I don’t want to die, i just want to sleep. I fear that one day I'm just gonna be at the wrong place at the wrong time and experience pain, that some cop is gonna think im holding a gun and shoot, and that they are going to get away with it. That someones gonna frame me for something I didn't do and i'm gonna suffer. I'm suffering right now. I don’t want to suffer anymore. I don’t want to die from someone else, in fact i don’t want to die when i'm not ready. I Want to die when im ready. And right now I kinda feel like i'm ready. I just don't feel like im set out for this place. Everyday is just 24 hours of me suffering. I feel just so unlucky. I lost hope completely. Iu don’t wake up refreshed and eager to start a new day I start new days waking up wishing I could go back to sleep. Wishing that my dreams were real because at least in my dreams I can smile and laugh for once. At Least in my dreams I can live the life I always wanted without facing judgement. Because judgement just sucks. Everywhere I go there are eyes watching and judging me. Theres so many people that want to harm and torture people. Innocent people. People like me who just don’t have a care for the world. I lost passion for everything. I'm just stressed. I’m not who I was anymore. Instead of enjoying things i'm just trying to distract myself. Distract myself from death. Distract myself from the world. Distract myself from my financial issues. I might not be able to dance anymore. I was supposed to get a solo. All of my friends around me got one. My teacher even said i would. But then on picture day I walk into the room and she pulls me aside and tells me i wont get one. And it doesnt fucking help that everyone around me is bragging about their solos. In Fact everyone is bragging about something I don't have. And it's so hard to be happy for people when i'm not even happy for myself. We re 10,000 fucking dollars in dance debt. We owe 2,000 for our electric bill. The lights are off at my moms house. And fuck yeah im crying right now. I cry all the time. No one cares anymore. All the love I had for people around me is just gone. And I'm trying to be optimistic about things. I'm trying to look at things with a “maybe something good will happen” but the outcome is always the same. Everyday is just a bad day now. A single inconvenience just washes what was meant to be a good day down the drain. It gotten so bad that i just sleep just to get a break. I sleep just to have what feels like a few minutes of happiness. I wish i could sleep longer sometimes. Hell falling asleep is getting harder for me. Melatonin doesn't work anymore. I don’t want to be awake. I don't want to be awake anymore. Everything, and I mean everything is just crumbling for me. The people I thought I could trust and love are stabbing me in the backs and at this point I doubt they'd care if I died. Hell i wouldn't care if i die. It's just that death, death is appealing. If i don't wish it on myself i wish it on others. People, things are just destructive. And they won't go away. I just really really really need a break from things. I don’t want my suicide to be painful. I don’t want to drown. I don’t want to shoot or stab myself. I want it to be quick and effective. Maybe for my birthday ill ask to go skydiving and i won’t pull the parachute. Maybe ill just jump off an apartment building. I might be alive for now. Maybe for the next few minutes, or a couple of days maybe a year. I’m miserable, and im not ready to continue living right now. I can’t keep living like this because it hurts and I want it to stop. And no. no one knows how I feel. I told a few people but they weren't as helpful as I thought. It didn’t make me feel better, just made me feel hopeless. My parents, they don't care. They know how I feel but haven't done shit. I cant do shit. I'm responsible for the death of Alexis D, or atleast im going to be. Thanks for letting me vent for a moment.",
351,"I don’t want to continueI am completely alone as I don’t have anyone to care about or anyone who cares about me. I can’t make friends and I don’t know why cause I try so hard. In school I did all sorts of clubs to try to make new friends but it always ended up that I would be excluded from the “main group” (not sure if there’s a word for what I’m trying to say). The most I ever got was someone talking to me because they needed something from me. I got so desperate I joined a couple of churches but ultimately left cause I just couldn’t relate to any of those people. The one person I did have,who was my only friend in high school, told me he’s too busy to spend any more time with me, so now I don’t even have anyone to confide in. I also ended up dropping out of school cause my grades were so bad I couldn’t hope to graduate on time and my family can’t afford to pay for more than 4 years and now my parents are disappointed in me for wasting their money. And now I feel like all I am is a problem. I started cutting myself cause it makes me feel a little better when I do and I think I’m about ready to end my life. I was prepared to do it yesterday, wrote a note and everything, but my dad’s gun wasn’t in it’s normal place and I couldn’t find it. Worse comes to worse I’ll buy my own. I’d prefer a gun cause I just want it to be quick.",
352,"I recovered from cancer twice and might metastase again, and no one seems to understand how much impact this makes on my life.Hey peeps. I never feel i can talk about this, even on reddit. People seem to think i make things up. It is really hurtful. From my 11th i have been walking around with nerve pain, which got worse to an indescribable pain. No doctor seemed to be able to find the caise of my pain and no one took me serious. I was ready to end my life when i turned 15. A few months later i got diagnosed with a benign tumour in my spinal canal which compressed my nerves at L5-S1 level (lower back), and was removed successfully. 10 years later i was declared cured. 2 years after that, the cancer came back. T was worse. The pain was unbearable. Some people tried to tell me it was all in my head. Turned out that this tumour was really bad because it was completely stuck between my nerves and the scar tissue from the last surgery. I got surgery, and most of it got removed, but not all. This was more than a year ago and i stull have a lot of pain, due to my damaged nerves. Pretty soon after my surgery i picked up my studies again, despite coming off heavy opioids and other medication. No one seems to notice how strong i have been and no one realizes where i went through. Somehow it just hurts me a lot that people won’t acknowledge my illness and what kind of impact this made on my life. I live in constant pain. I live in uncertainty because there is a good chance that it will come back with an even worse outcome. This time only my bladder and bowel nerve got damaged, so i cannot go to the toilet very well. I also lost sensation in my left leg. I learned to walk straight again. Off course i am keeping my head of and staying positive. Even when i am hanging out with friends, they sometimes talk about that one of them ever had cancer or a family member had it. Everyone is like ‘wow man, that’s something!’ And they ask a ton of questions and are super supportive And somehow they think i am this stone, not needing any support. I’m sorry i just need to vent. I don’t expect any support but i surely hope to get it somewhere.",

My life has always been shit and ive always had the thought of killing myself but ive never had the guts to. Well not until now. Like I said my life has always been shit but at the start of 2019 it got so much worse, I meet so many amazing people and managed to mess up with worseall of them to the point they now hate me and openly express that hate to me. Most of the people who I talk to about this just say things like if they left then obviously they weren't meant for u, but I don't see it like that. I see as I messed up and hurt so I don't deserve to live. I've made a promise to myself that when I hurt someone I have to hurt myself in return. But people leaving my life aren't the only reason I'm going to end my life, I've had severe depression and anxiety since I was about 10 years old and I've always hated myself for everything I do, the way I look ect. When I meet new people I always try to warn them about how I'm a bad person but they never believe me but I've hurt people, destroyed peoples live, destroyed things, I've shot ice, I've done coke, I've done LSD, MDMA and ecstasy.I have stabbed people. I have beaten the shit out of people and robbed them. I've done so much bad shit and what I just listed then doesn't even scratch the surface of what I've done. I want to kill myself so I can no longer hurt people, weather there a random person or someone I love, and yes by killing myself I will hurt them but that bit of pain would be better then the pain I would inflict on them while being alive. So this is why I am gonna kill myself, and what I have listed is only some of the reasons I'm going to do this. I have written my suicide note and I have tied the noose and set it up so sometime tonight I am hopefully going to end my life and stop the pain for myself and everyone who knows me.",

357,"My(our)story This is a lot to read, but any time you give will be greatly appreciated. I just wanted to get this of my chest and I know my girl checks here often. I(m19)have battled really bad depression for years. I'm on the autistic spectrum and have aspergers syndrome. And one of the 'side affects' of my condition is I'm constantly on a extremely high level of stress in my body. I may not always feel stress but according to my body we are always just in extreme danger. And because of that my body has swelled up making me look fat even though I actually live very healthy, eat well, and get exercise. And I've always hated my body. I've tried so hard, going to the gym regularly and dieting to try and change it but nothing worked. When I was 13 I had sexually molested my younger sister and I've never been able to forgive myself. Thankfully she doesn't remember, but that shadow of what I've done has weighed me down since then. I always felt I would never be loved. I thought I would be alone forever. And I wasn't even sure I could let someone be with me because of how horrible I thought I was. From the incident with my sister and never being able to forgive myself I was ready to end my life. The world felt empty to me. There are only a few reasons I didn't end it all. I got into video games heavily at the time because it distracted me from the life I hated so much. And I stopped loving for myself. I had no drive for the future. I didn't want anything anymore. But I felt I had a mission. That I was put in certain peoples lives to heal them. And so I made that my life goal. I helped the people I felt I needed to till I was about18-19. By that point I had a friend group that was considered family more than anything else. But through certain events I became really close with two of the friends. Let's call them S. And P.. I got involved in a polyamorous relationship with S. And P. Because P. Had told me that she liked me. And for me it was like a drug. If it was a chance that someone actually liked me for me I had to take it. I soon realized what a bad decision that was. I was barely even an extra. They were 'married' but weren't legally married. I gave her affection and love in hopes for some in return but I didn't get much. I mainly got dragged in because S. Had an extra as well, her name was Rebekah. And S. Started to give her more Attention than P. And P. Felt left out. So I got involved to fill in where S. Couldn't. And during that period Rebekah had something happen in her family. She reached out to me as her friend and I was able to comfort her as things were starting to get Rocky with her side of the relationship thing. She got closer with me and asked if she could see me being with her. I politely declined because at the time I couldn't do anything to displease P. Out of sheer fear that I was gonna lose what little part of her I had. And so things continued with our relationship thing and I continued to feel drained of everything and getting nothing in return because I never felt loved enough. And that wasn't enough for me and it actually drove me insane. It was tearing me apart. I wanted her to myself but I couldn't say that. I didn't want to tear apart my 2 best friends. I eventually had to leave the relationship. I was broken again for a few days when. I made the decision. I knew what I wanted in a relationship but again I felt I would never have a good one. Then on Xmas night of 2019 I started messaging S.'s extra, Rebekah. I told her that I was leaving the relationship because it wasn't enough. Through talking about it all we realized we both wanted the same thing in a relationship. I ended things with S. And P. That night. She did the next day since things were already dry between her and S. And we met up the next day. From when I first saw her again and hugged her, I felt loved. I didn't know how to process it immediately. It felt nicer that anything else in my life. The comfort of holding her in my arms was indescribable. We talked for a few days after that, our feelings growing stronger by the day, and everything we learned about eachother, our likes and dislikes, our dreams and aspirations, and what we wanted in a relationship lined up so indescribably perfectly. I fell more in love with her with every new thing I learned about her. Our second day we actually got together as a couple, I couldn't hold it anymore. I told her I loved her, and she said it back, and everything stopped. Inside, the steel that trapped my heart shattered. All the pain and insecurities I had faded away for the time. I cried because I couldn't hold in how it felt. I felt loved. I told her what I had done to my sister, and she didn't look at me any different. She even said she loved me more because she knew the real me and that I was able to tell her. She loves my body. She finds me sexy even. In just the short time that we've been together I have fallen even deeper in love with her every day. I've never been happier other than when I can't be with her. It feels like my body is dead without her with me, and I can't wait to hold her in my arms again. We've talked and just grown closer together so much and it's been the greatest thing ever. We've talked about our future, and we are both so excited. Before her, I had no real drive to live. Now every day I wake up so happy to share a world with her. Every chance I get to talk to her is the next best second of my life. We've talked, and she told me if I were to propose today she would say yes. It's indescribable how amazing she has made me feel and how happy I've been. Nothing compares to it. She has made my life worth living to me, and I can't think of a life without her anymore. She has given me so much love and care, and it's so overwhelmingly amazing. I can't help but feel terribly unworthy of it, but I spend every day trying to feel worthy. My life genuinely has never been better and I'm so greatful. I love her so much and can't wait to spend forever with her. Thank you to anyone that read this far. I greatly appreciate it. And to anyone that feels like I did, just don't give up. Keep living the best life you can. Be yourself and never let that go. Stay strong and I'm sure you will find your person.",
358,"Hitting a rough spot because I'm too broke to get back into the hobby/business I lovedI used to be a photographer. Shot a lot of weddings, did a lot of portraiture, was doing pretty good. I was pretty good at it. A few years ago, I was really low and getting ready to end my life. I sold all of my equipment to help pay bills. All my camera bodies, all my lenses, all my lighting, everything. I deleted all my social media accounts, deleted my photo hosting accounts and deleted my website. I've never stopped loving photography. I adore people's photos online, these lucky few who didn't sell all their shit because they lost all will to live. And I've never lost the itch to take photos. I have thousands that I've taken on my phone. Some of them are pretty good. Enough to have been printed and hung on my walls. But there's just something about having an SLR and some good glass. I miss it so much, and now that I've been doing better, I desperately want to get back into it. But to just get a basic amount of the equipment I had back, it's thousands of dollars. And it's leading me back into the negative mindset I've been successfully avoiding for a while now: ""I'll never be able to."" It's just so hard because having a hobby is a wonderful escape from depression. I think everyone should have something they do that allows them to escape everything and just *do something*. And the one hobby I'm good at and that provides me so much joy, *I can't do*. Just needed to get that out, feels better writing it than just internalizing everything. Hope you all out there are doing ok.",
359,"I was about to kill myself last nightI felt like my world was closing and so alone. Just so unloved and ready to end my life. I wrote a suicide note, and was minutes away from taking my life in my room while my parents were asleep until it crossed my mind that I should keep going, because I don’t know what will happen in the future. Good times don’t last forever but bad times don’t either. I remembered all the people that love me, because no matter what issues my parents have they do love me, so do my sisters and some friends that I don’t speak to anymore, but there’s people that still care. Most of all though, I realized I still care about myself and I can’t quit on me. If you’re going through something, don’t give up. Put your head up, pick up your broken pieces and glue them back together, then move forward with life and don’t look back. Much love,",

362,"HelpI don’t know where to begin or if anyone will even reply but I had some bad thoughts today and I’m ashamed of them. I’m 16 and have had depression, anxiety for 4 years now, it started off with body issues then it got worse and long story short I have a load of different small things wrong with my body that add up to make it a really big deal. I’ve been off school quite a bit because of this. Luckily enough I have a nice group of what I think of are friends, I’ll get to that in a minute. But for my whole life I’ve always been that guy who everyone thinks it’s ok to abuse me, verbally, and sometimes physically. I’ve never said it was bullying becuase everyone has only done small things to me, but they don’t know that others are doing so. At the moment people have a go at me for wearing clothes I like, being fat apparently but this is only becuase I have quite big legs. I get called an emo because I have become quite quiet over the past few years. People take the piss out of me for not being school that much. And it’s mostly my group of friends becuase the only time I talk to them is on Xbox where I can speak to them and On weekends when we go out. I get called shit at football all the time. These may not seem bad but I’m at a very big school and everyone in the years is very close with each other except for me. I’m also not allowed to like things like memes and video games. One of my “friends” always compares himself to me and says he is way better than me at everything he once said “year younger than you and I’m smarter funnier stronger faster and better at sport than you” after he said that was when I tried to kill myself for the first time. A couple of weeks ago I opened up to him about why I was missing school and told him a load of private information and things I would probably end myself if he told other people. A couple of weeks after that he compared himself to me again and said how he’s way more interesting and that nobody wants to talk to me because All I talk about is Xbox and memes. A week later from that we all went out for a meal and I was sat there and I couldn’t get into any of the conversations they had. It was like the last 8 years of my life with these people had just gone and they were different or I was different. Fast forward a week to today, we went to go watch the new Star Wars. And I had the white 2 hours 20 mins getting pop corn drinks and other hard candy thrown at me as if I was degraded, and when I said stop they would say I was just crying. After that we went to sub way and we were sitting down and I was talking to them and no matter what I said they would mock any thing that came out of my mouth. So I couldn’t take it anymore so I tried to leave but they tried to stop me and said I was just crying about it again. And that’s when I had the thought of absolutely beating the shit out of one of my friends because I couldn’t take it anymore I was done with them just disrespecting me and treating me like shit. What am I doing wrong or is it just me being soft, this has all gone on for about 3 years now, and they have slowly got more aggressive towards me. I feel like they don’t want me to be apart of the group anymore and maybe I don’t belong any more. Anyway I think I’m ready to end my life because I can’t take this shit anymore, obviously there is way more going other than issues with my fiends but this is what I’ve decided to post instead of telling strangers everything that has contributed.

363,"I published my first book*I’m not going to say the name of the book because I don’t want this to be an advertisement.* TLDR at bottom. I’ve wanted to be a writer/author since I was eight years old. I mainly wrote stories and poems for fun and sometimes for school. I’ve had a few english teachers encourage me to become a writer after some creative writing assignment I’d done well on, but coming from a very conventional family being a writer/actor/etc was always discouraged. This time last year I dropped out of college after some issues with PTSD and depression. It’d been years since I’d written anything because I had an ex read through a journal of mine and I never wanted to feel so vulnerable again. I hated the thought of putting anything on paper that could be read by others, but I started writing again to cope. I started writing poems to explain what I was going through and deal with the flashbacks. Eventually I shared them with a close friend, and then with my now-ex girlfriend. They both encouraged me to keep writing so I did and now it’s a book. A year ago I was ready to end my life; I didn’t think I’d ever be happy or get past what happened. I definitely didn’t think my life would be like this and I’m so excited for my book release in a few weeks. tl;dr I started writing poems on a shared google doc to cope with mental health issues and now it’s a book.",
364,"Please help me to get some perspective on a long term relationship that has ended but is not completely over and is causing me a huge amount of pain and anxietyMe 38/M her 38/F This is a long story and I don't know where to start or how to proceed but I'll try to highlight the important stuff and outline it as best I can. The relationship started in 2014 after we met on a dating site. The year before we met I had become addicted to opiates as a result of a snowboarding injury and by the time we started dating I was using on a daily basis. She found out not long after we started dating but made the decision to stay together despite the fact that her parents were both drug addicts and she had a very tough childhood because of it. Another thing I will mention is that her brother was murdered 11 years ago when the jealous ex boyfriend of his girlfriend came to their house and shot them both. So she's been through a lot in her life. Trust has always been an issue for her and I broke that trust many times in our relationship because of my addiction and lying to try and hide my use and as a result she thought I lied about more than drugs which was not the case but understandable. One of the biggest issues in our relationship was that she would constantly accuse me of cheating on her although I never have and in fact there were a few times that she cheated on me although she denies it was cheating because would break up and get back together (always initiated by her when my addiction would make her too upset) during the time we were together I was constantly either strung out and trying to get clean, going to rehab or clean for a few months at a time. I feel terrible about not being able to clean up my act sooner and for putting her through all the BS that goes with having a relationship with an addict. We both loved each other very much and still do although given all that's happened things were obviously very strained. I will explained what happened in the last year and a half that's led up to where things are at now since it's most pertinent to the situation. Spring of 2018 I was clean and got a great job that required me to do 3 weeks of training in another state. We were not together technically at the time but were talking frequently and she was still interested in me provided I was making progress. Upon my announcement of the job and flying to another state to do training, while I was there we decided to try to make things work and devote ourselves to the relationship. I will also mention that even when we were together and things were going as well as they could, me being clean etc. She would frequently bring up that she didn't know if we should be together and thought we should break up or that she didn't know why I loved her because we had different interests and how I should be with someone who was more like me, which I would always deny and tell her how much I loved her and that I wanted to be with her forever which was the truth but she always had doubts. How much of this was her own insecurities and the fear of being hurt again I don't know. I do know she had been cheated on in the past though. So after I finished the job training I came back and moved in with her. This lasted all of a week as she accused me of relapsing and kicked me out even though I was clean. She later apologized and acknowledged that she wish she wouldnt have done it as what happened afterwards started a big chain reaction of things getting a lot worse. We broke up and then about a month later got back together. I had agreed to take UA's for her whenever she wanted but even when I'd take a home test in front of her she'd have a hard time accepting the results because the lines weren't perfectly clear or whatever, even though the result was definitely negative for drugs. It happened again a couple weeks after we got back together and I was really upset because I had been clean and was working really hard on recovery and my job and really trying to get my life together for myself and for us. I ended up relapsing at this point because I was really sad that she refused to believe me or the drug test in front of her face. Still it was my birthday and she took me out for dinner at which point the plan was for her to pick up her daughter on her way home and drop her at a friend's and then I was going to come to her place and spend the night. Shortly after I got home from our dinner and got ready to go over there, she texts me that we're breaking up because I was using again and that this time we were done for good. I hadn't told her I had relapsed at that point but it was obvious enough for her to see even though I denied it. I completely fell apart at that point and started using really heavily. We talked for a few weeks after that and agreed to do counseling but then she ended up ghosting me which really cut me deeply and made me super anxiety ridden and heartbroken. I asked her why after she agreed to do counseling she would completely ignore me and she didnt respond. After a few weeks of this I told her I really needed to talk to her to which she agreed but then after a few days she started ignoring me again. She agreed to see me on the weekend but by midweek she stopped responding. I told her on that Friday that I was coming over after work because we needed to talk and she had agreed to see me. She told me not to come over but I was so upset and hurt by that point that I decided to go over anyways. Well when I got there the lights were out even though it was only about 9pm. She had invited her sister and sisters husband over apparently as I saw by the vehicles and not wanting to wake them if they were asleep, I knocked on the back door by her room a few times and no one answered. The her sisters husband comes out and tells me i need to leave and that she doesn't want to talk to me and I said fine whatever im leaving and as I went back to the front yard to leave the cops showed up and arrest me for criminal tresspassing. I couldnt belive it and was completely shocked and beyond hurt by that. I bailed myself out and went home but I sent her a pretty angry email in which I used a lot of bad language and said some pretty mean things to her. We had never so much as raised our voices at each other in the time we were together and I NEVER threatened her verbally or physically to any extent. Shortly after that she got a restraining order against me because according to her it was the only way she could end things permanently. I was even more hurt and heartbroken by this and I emailed her demanding an explanation. She called the cops for violating it and new at that point I had a warrant out for my arrest so after being fired from work the following weekend due to my drug use making me less than punctual and all the relationship stuff taking my focus, I left town and figured I'd just leave everything and start over somewhere else. I was super distraught over everything and was still trying to contact her via email despite the circumstances. I ended up getting her to call me after I had left town and was totally despondent and was a total wreck. She agreed to meet me at a bar for a quick talk if I came back to town. Due to the heavy use I was completely oblivious to how stupid it was of me to think that she wanted to see me and sure enough when I got to where we agreed to meet her car was nowhere to be found but about 3 seconds later I was being arrested again. The police contacted her, making me sound like an armed and dangerous criminal which freaked her out even more as they insinuated that I was somehow there to hurt her which they had no basis to do so as I again had never threatened her. I went to jail for about 3 months and was charged with a FELONY for endangering a person protected by a restraining order. This had completely screwed my life up as now that I'm in the criminal justice system with a person to person crime, I'm basically treated as a violent criminal and the same as if I had assaulted or tried to kill someone. My professional career is basically over and I was left reeling from everything that happened and still heartbroken and very distraught and desperately wanting to at least have some closure. After I got out of jail I managed to get a part time job and stayed away from her but after about 3 months we gradually started talking again and she saw that I was doing good. We didnt spend much time together as she didnt want anyone to know we were even talking much less carrying on a relationship again. This continued through last winter and into spring and even though I did end up relapsing for a short time, I cleaned up my act quickly and she didnt know because we saw each other infrequently. Fast forward to this spring, I got a full time job doing manual labor (my career was in the tech industry prior to all this) and we started talking more frequently. We decided that after the restraining order expired to start dating again and everything was going ok although we were still dealing with the unresolved issues around lack of trust, her not being able to stop accusing me of cheating despite me telling her over and over how hurtful it was. (I had tried everything I could think of to fix things by offering to let her remotely access my phone whenever she wanted, see all my calls and texts, video chat whenever she wanted so she could see I was where I said I was but she never wanted to do those things and in fact when I would press her on it and say that if she really thought I was cheating why would she stay with someone like that to which she would respond, no I guess I don't REALLY think you're cheating) Over the summer I worked really hard to rebuild my life, had a full time job and my own place for the first time since we started dating and had been clean for the better part of a year at that point. Then the worst thing imaginable in my life happened, I got injured on the job where they promptly took me to the hospital and shot me up with morphine. I had relapsed in the blink of an eye and it completely freaked me out. I was given a prescription for pain meds which I let her rip up but shortly after my trip to the hospital I started using again. She asked me if I had relapsed and for the first time in our relationship I was honest about in and started sobbing and telling her yes I had but that it's not what I wanted and I was going back to recovery and determined not to let it ruin my life again. She held me and told me she would support me and that it would be ok but immediately she started pulling away and distancing herself. She continued to treat me progressively more coldly and distantly and basically tried to get me to break up with her by seeing how much emotional abuse it would take for me to finally leave her. At this point i told her we really needed counseling ans she agreed but each time i would set up apointment, she would find a reason she couldn't make it. This upset me more than anything because I had worked so hard to finally overcome years of active addiction and show her I was truly ready to be together and put that life behind me. I did get clean again but at that point the damage had been done and she continued to distance herself alough we would still see each other on weekends when her kids weren't home. I eventually fell apart from this because I couldn't bare the thought of losing her or everything I had worked so hard for, again. I ended up missing work one morning after staying up all night trying to talk to her about things and being so upset about how things were going and ended up getting fired. I told her I couldn't deal with the reality that I had lost her, my job and with no way to pay next month's rent, my home. It hit me way hard and I completely freaked. I told her I was going to OD and I couldn't deal with life any more. I told her I needed her more than ever at that point and she needed to be there for me because I was ready to end my life. She responded by blocking my number. I ended up attempting to OD a few times over the course of a couple weeks and while we were still talking she refused to see me and always had an excuse of being too busy. I kept telling her how much I needed her support but she refused to do much outside of texting me and occasionally talking on the phone. After about a month of not seeing me at all I went to her house before she left for work one morning and I was totally despondent and told her I just needed a hug. She became super upset that I had just showed up at her house and said said something extremely hurtful asking me if I had shown up to kill her when I had asked for a hug already in tears. After that she went to work and called my probation officer telling them I showed up at her house without her consent and that she felt unsafe. They contacted me and told me to report in which I knew meant they were going to arrest me. I then contacted her again asking her why she would do that and told her I was going to OD again which I tried and was almost sucessful. I spent about a month in jail and got out in the beginning of october. I stayed clean after getting out and I was trying really hard to start over again and get my life back on track and I figured I would see if she was willing to do counseling with me at some point but about 2 weeks ago she contacted me out of the blue and told me she's in a relationship with someone and while she would do counseling to try and heal from our past and find closure, she doesnt want a relationship and wants to move on with her life. After almost 6 years of being together and all that we've been through, I am so heartbroken by her decision. I know our relationship has been filled with a lot of drama and hearbreak but we do both really love each other and she has admitted that she's in the new relationship because it's new and there's no baggage but that she still loves me and is having a hard time getting over me. I feel like we never did the right thing of getting professional help for our issues and that with counseling and my finally being over any desire to use and putting my recovery before anything else that we could finally have a chance to make things work. I believe if she saw a way to resolve things through counseling and we had a solid foundation of trust and communication she would feel the same but I am completely overwhelmed and heart broken by her decision and am having a hard time focusing on my continuing effort to heal and improve myself or anything else right now because the pain and anxiety of her dating some one else is consuming me. We're scheduled for counseling next week but I don't know how to proceed or if I should even try to fix things between us with the hope of a future together. The other thing that really complicates things is this summer she got a huge promotion and was making just under 6 figures all of a sudden after years of making just enough to get by and next year she will go to commission and be making over a half million a year. I am not a materialistic person at all but the thought of financial security is really attractive and it makes me very resentful that after so long together of dealing with both us struggling to make ends meet, we should be able to enjoy some financial improvement together and that this new guy certainly doesn't deserve to jump in and get that lifestyle with her as I'm left heartbroken and struggling to survive especially since she's contributed to making it next to impossible for me to get meaningful work. I don't feel like I'm able to let go and I'm struggling so badly with what to do and how to approach things. TLDR LTR relationship ended badly, we've agreed to do counseling but now she's dating someone else and I'm totally devastated.",
365,I was planning to go downstairs around 5 to eat breakfast (yeah I eat around that time cuz I’m too lazy to go downstairs) and I ended up going at 10 pm cuz I was making music for 4 hours. I washed my dish and was ready to go to bed around 2 am and now it’s almost 6 am. What is life,
366,"Disturbing Discussion: Suicide on Acid Experience.I’ve been extremely depressed due to some unfortunate situations happening in my life. Saturday Night I decided to end it all. I had no hope no need to live, but I always had the trouble of actually ending my life. I’ve done acid multiple times, some on higher some on lower doses, My second highest dose (600 ug) was my only bad trip. I had an outrageous fight with my girlfriend while she was tripsitting me and I truly almost committed suicide because of how shitty I felt and what my mind was thinking. Everything went dark and it truly felt like I was in Hell, I would close my eyes and I just saw the darkest places in the world. Luckily my girlfriend (bless her) understood what was happening and reassured and accessed the situation to calm me down. Forward a few months, here we are. A few days past my failed suicide. I took around 400 ug (Two Tabs) fully aware and ready to commit suicide. I thought if I could get that dark in my head I could actually do it. I went and turned my phone off around 2 hours into the trip saturday around 7 PM and the illusions started to shape itself in my life. I was in a shitty frame of mind, and I already was feeling my head start thinking some truly disturbing thoughts. I went and snuck out my house and brought an old ipod with me, including around 20 of the saddest songs i’ve ever heard. I also had 2 blades from a brand new pencil sharpener I brought prior to ensure clean and comfortable cuts. I knew where my radical artery ( correct me if i’m wrong) and another one a bit below it on my wrist. There’s a greenway in my neighborhood that’s especially spooky at night and if you continue a bridge with a huge open field, where a gang fight happened that concluded in about 10 deaths. It was ominous and scary. At the peak around 8:00 P.M I was standing on the Bridge and truly got visual hallucinations of the Gang battle that i’ve never seen before. I’ve never experienced true visual hallucinations before on Acid, it was freaking me out. With all of this in mind, I was shaking and ready to end my life. I grabbed my blade and started doing slight cuts, to get my mind moving more. With how bad I was shaking when I attempted to cut my artery which looked like a worm at the time, I couldn’t cut it I kept missing. Eventually I started to get some tingling in my right hand where i had planned it. (Not related to the Acid.) That’s when everything changed for some reason my mind went so dark and ghostly. To bright. I’m not sure what triggered in my mind because i knew I wasn’t thinking good thoughts, but i got this sudden surge of butterflies you could say. My mood and expression changed completely. I was starting to laugh and I was seeing more closing my eyes then opening them. And instead of seeing a Gang battle and blood. I was seeing this room with a unspecific personage. (I’m christian) and thought it was god himself. I came toward home actually moving and I just felt so much peace. I had an epicdemic moment. Where i just saw my life flash before my eyes. Everything good and bad. And I remembered a quote from Bob Ross (The famous artist) Saying that there needs to be bad moments in life so you can realize and notice when the good moments. I threw my blades down into the tiny river under the bridge, and just started walking home. Everything felt so surreal. I feel changed. I know i am sober atm. I feel like i have a complete different look at life and how beautiful it can be. I’m not sure if anyone else has ever experienced a trip going to bad to good without your will. Not sure if there was something in the acid either. It was the same guy i always bought from so i didn’t bother testing it. That’s my story. I’m not sure if god made that happen or what. I can tell that LSD can truly change your personality and the way you think. I was fully ready to die. and I didn’t. At this moment I feel like i have no reason to die. I was given a second chance of life, and I plan to take advantage to that. Thanks for Listening to my story. I hope everyone stays safe. Happy Tripping and Good Thoughts Ahead. <3. EDIT: It's been a while since and its crazy the amount of support and positive and informational comments and DM's I've received. I'm doing a lot better today and I appreciate you all for your words of encouragement <3",
367,"How many times do you need to hear that you were wrong before it sinks in?How many times have we done this dance? How many times have you lost? How many times have you heard close family or friends tell you, to your face, that you were not right and you were incredibly hurtful before it actually sinks in that YOU are not right in the head? You tell lies, all the time, and when you get discovered for what you are you just cut ties and move on with telling the same lies with new people...until you get discovered where you just cut ties again and move on to newer people but still tell the same lies. And I've halted you before, on more than one occasion. And now, recently, I see it's still going on. You just moved on to new people again but still telling the same old lies, still playing the same game with no end. But I won't stop you this time, I really want to...not to hurt you or be ""petty"" as you liked to call it, but to prevent someone else from getting hurt by you. I can't protect the whole world from you, especially as it seems you are hell bent on being that victim. You were with the guy before me, and the guy before him, and the guy before him...and from what you've stated of your childhood it just seems like it's how you are. Just a sad little girl, just a sad excuse for a human. You have had family say you are toxic, you have had your ""best friend"" say you are too. And me. And the guy before me...yeah his mother was saying the same. You have to lie to get sympathy, claiming stuff that never happened...until I proved it did. And what you said. And even when you had people abandon you because of your lies and your games, still you think YOU are the victim. But you don't play victim with the people who know you, you play victim to strangers who have no idea who you are, what you have done, and not just to me but to others. Not just what you did to my kid but what you do to your own. She has practically no other family, she knows no better, she has never had the luxury of the other parent telling her that THEY are sorry for how YOU treat HER. Like seriously, you have multiple infestation going on in your place at once, and when your kid tells you the bed bugs kept her up all night attacking her feet you told her she was dirty and kept her room messy. You pretty much told her it was her fault because she isn't clean. Who in the fuck do you think you are?!!!? Your kid is unclean because you let her not shower for weeks on end, your kids room is messy because you refuse to tell her to clean up, and your place is infested because you refused to talk to your landlord so he could get it fumagated. Shouldn't surprise me though, you blamed the dog for shitting on the bathroom floor as you would keep him locked in there, lucky if he got a walk in 48 hours. It's not the dogs fault he shit on the ground when you refuse to walk him, or even get your own kid to do so. How many lives do you need to ruin, how many friends do you need to lose, how many people will it take before you can look in that mirror and see what everyone else sees, a very scared and ugly person who feels inadequate so you spend your time destroying other's lives to make you feel better about your own? Will it ever come? Is it in your mental capacity to actually GROK that? I don't think so. I truly don't, at least not on any level that you will acknowledge. Maybe when you are alone at night, longing for someone's embrace and all you find is an empty bed and people who are too busy to talk to you it sinks in, maybe for a second or two. That's it. You been playing the victim for so long I don't think you know any other way. Don't say you miss me. Just stop. You don't mean it, if you couldn't be bothered to say it when it mattered over the past few years and you can only send it into the ether for strangers to see, you don't mean it. Just like your love, but at least when it comes to love you could admit the one and only time you ever stated it to me was by accident. An accident which showed how much you intentionally would not say it even as I was ready to end it all, even as I was ready to end my life because you were saying I was wrong, I was entitled, I was crazy. Yeah...I was crazy for thinking somewhere deep inside you did care. You didn't. You still do not care about anything than yourself. Have fun playing victim to strangers again, telling your stories with no proof of anything you say. I'm not going to call you out, I'm not going to expose you for a third time. I'll let those strangers figure it out on their own. I hope they don't get too hurt by your games.",
368,"My life is going nowhere. Ready to end my suffering.My whole life I've been punished just for being who I am. Everything started when I was going to Primary School. Everyone was bullying me for being that weird kiddo that never listened to the teachers but was self taught and knew everything. I didn't have a father when he was needed in growing up moment of my life. He was beating my mom because of alcochol and his addiction to it. Whole my life I was traveling because of my mom loans. Everything was rough no one liked me because I always was ending up as an ""outsider"" at every school. One time someone in my school almost broke my neck and he got nothing for it. I cried. I was broken down to pieces and even up to this day I feel the same. Later in my life my mom second husband was diagnosed with brain tumor and died on my and my mom eyes. I never liked him but I knew that my mom is loving him so that's why I tried to be his good frend. After everything she was so down that she became an alcoholic like my father. She started to be prostitute right in front of my eyes. I didn't have enyone to help me with my pain. I started to learn programming and that was like medicine. I wasn't thinking about anything. Few years later I got my first job as frontend developer and hell continued. My boss was telling me that I was smelling bad and I wasn't taking good care of myself because of that. I was starting to get depression and commited suicide. My mom rescued me freezing to death on bench poisoned with alcochol. I've meet a girl that wanted to change everything. She helped me a lot. And then she started to do bad things. She talked with my friend at the time about sex and that she was ready to cheat on me. I was begging her to stay and help me. I was crying every night because she was hurting me in multiple ways. I wanted the best for her. I was taking loans on holidays just to feel good. I helped her with finding job and wanted to live with her. I wanted to get going with my life not standing still. Now I have really good salary at my job but people who was there at the time left me unfinished jobs and I need to work 18h a day to fix this mess. I'm not happy with my life and I'm feeling empty. My life was a fucking mess and still is. Now I don't feel anything. I'm ready to jump of the my fathers apartement like friend of mine did. I hate my life.",
369,"Mental Health In 2019 As the year finishes I wanted to talk about my mental health this year. It is my 3rd year of server issues. Beginning was my sophomore year of hs, and it was not good. I joined sports med and the people were... toxic per say. Rude to me for no reason, putting everything one me -the only new one- and kicking back while calling me lazy. My best friend of 12 years got a bf, I was happy until she started pushing me away. I stopped eating and was ready to end my life. March 9th was a hard day, the day my GG (great grandma) died 3 years and it was hard. I got close with another girl, and she helped me so much. The sports med people all left the program and we got a new trainer who is amazing and I was the only one left from the pervious year. She asked me to help her build the program. So I did. All summer I helped with the cleaning and supplies and even with the ‘interview’ to get people in. My mental health was getting better. Junior year came along and my one friend and I stopped talking besides the one class we have together and only do little. My new friend and I are so close her mom calls me daughter and I have my own bed and spare cloths. She surprised me for my 16th birthday I got my license. Sports med is great. The people are great. There are two girls I don’t really want to put myself around but I grew close with one girl who graduated next year and I’ll miss her. I fell in love with football and it just ended which is sad. My school is city and CIF champs of our section. We have a 13-2 score when we had 0-10 my freshman. I love the guys and sad to see the seniors go. My mental health is great right now. I’m happy. Just know it gets better. I almost killed myself this year and now I can’t even think of that. I may only have two close friends but I love them more than anything. I love sports med. I love school. I love life. For the first time in 4 years.",
371,"Which is worse, fybrin glue on the nerves or 3rd and 4th degree burns?Hello fellow leakers, I just finished my second round of patches and the last one included a fybrin glue patch. A very morbid part of me has been wondering if I've finally topped out on the pain scale. Up until that second round with the fybrin glue, no doctor had ever managed to make me cry in pain. I have always been able to stay still and composed when it comes to physical pain. My point being, I don't think I'm wimpy. Most people are surprised at how much I tolerate before I show the pain. The only experience I have had that hurt more than the fybrin glue was having meningitis. I was chewing my arm bad-I was mad with pain and ready to end my life should that be my only escape. I have never had 3rd or 4th degree burns, but my extensive experience with accidentally burning myself while cooking is that burns hurt a fuck ton more than you'd think for the size of the sear. So now I turn to reddit, has anyone had the ""opportunity"" to compare them?",
372,"Visualization - How to beat porn - what will quitting porn do for you?First, let me introduce myself. I’ve been involved in NoFap since 2015. At the time, I was suffering from depression, suicidal thoughts and a huge lack of motivation. I was ready to end my life, despite living with a beautiful partner. Then, one night when I typed in the P word into google, it suggested Your Brain On Porn. That’s when google was actually helpful. I watched and rewatched the Great porn experiment over and over again, because my life was starting to make sense. I was really depleting myself through porn on a dopamine hamster wheel, the more depressed I got the more porn, the more porn the more depressed. Then I started to realize what I needed to do, and it really has come right into focus now. Many of us fail, many of us relapse - and I believe it is an issue with our imaginations. Essentially, porn lives in our imaginations - we see the attractive people in our minds and desire them. We may or may not drilling down to payment for premium services because we can’t get it out of our minds. So, if a huge chunk of our issues is our imaginations, can’t we turn that around. Why don’t we think about the benefits of removing porn out of our lives. More time to study, work hard - to achieve worthy goals. More time to work out. More focus. Better memory. And if were drilling down to pay for premium services, cancelling all of that and saving more money and getting out of debt (lets face it, with 500k people here, there’s probably 1000s who have lots of debt due to porn). So, lets talk about how getting rid of porn will improve our lives! Science says, if we visualize something for 30 seconds a day, you will actually achieve all you visualize - and visualizing also includes how you will feel about it. How would you feel about all the things I just described above. Pretty damn proud, I would think. So, let me go first. 1. By getting rid of porn, I can start to get my debt under control, because I did drill down to get vids under paywalls. 2. I get to really work on my tabletop RPG game, Tales from Trinity City - which I am almost done. 3. I have more time in the morning to improve my life by reading more, meditating more. 4. Spending much more time with my beautiful partner. And that makes me feel very happy. And when I feel like watching porn when I can’t fall asleep at night, I can always pet the family dog, who almost always sleeps by me - it’s so awesome.",

When I was in high school, I started to feel apathy, which later grew into something like depression. It’s hard for me to remember how I asked my mother to take me to some holiday, to my grandmother in the village. I was ready to end my life. And I wanted to see some faces for the last time.

375,"I have no one to talk to and I'm taken by fear and anxiety.Hi guys, so yesterday when I woke up I was ready to end my life because I was just to afraid of having a miserable future filled with regret. I don't think I'm an attractive person and I dont think a person would ever want to be with me for any period of time. Being alone a lot I ended up reading some comments of people trying to talk this guy out of it and I read something that really made me appreciate the path I have with my passion and the possibilities. I spent the rest of the day studying and went to the gym right after, left out feeling great but on the way back everything feel apart again... On the way back I ended up meeting with some people I used to know, one of them was a girl that I pushed away because I didn't think I was good enough at the beggining but after just felt better being by myself and focusing on my passion. I suffered from severe social anxiety for a while now and she is well aware of that so I just assumed that any chance of us having something was destroyed and that me even thinking about it so much was very pathetic because she saw how vulnerable of a person I am and that I'm not much of a dating material. We talked and she actually made a joke about me not socializing with other people that much and asked why I stoped texting her and that she felt sad about it. I was awkward, insecure and barely talked. Once she left I talked to much and got home feeling like absolute trash. She texted me, we talked a bit and then she left. In my mind she thinks I'm not interested or that I'm just too much of a coward. Here's the thing guys, everytime I try to do these things I end up having to deal with the snowball that becomes my mind so I usually just stay alone and accept that it is the sacrifice I have to make on my path to not be miserable. I do not want to be alone for the rest of my life So I am also taken by fear when I stay alone too long these days, I think of having a girl and I imagine myself showing my favourite movies to her and just filling her with love and attention. So what it comes to me is that i am throwing this chance away and that I will become old, alone and regretful as I said before, probably killing myself on the same period. Should I go out with her even if it can be detrimental to my mental health? Am I ready for this? Do I not want to be with her or am I just forcing it because of the fear? I stay alone a lot these days because people here just don't get me so i end up acting differently than i am. I'm moving to Spain next year so I presume loneliness will be a big part of my life as well. I stay alone a lot and consider myself to be pretty inteligent with things that interest me. I study and take notes all day. I just look at her and I can't imagine how she can like me sexually or in an emotional way after being such a mess of a person and so ugly. I mean I went to reddit and wrote a text because of a bus encounter. I do not want to be just friends with her so if I cannot do that then what the hell am I doing. A little backstory: The last two years of my life were me alone so focused on what I loved and not really wanting to do anything else. This girl apparently tought I was handsome and asked my number to a friend and once we went out to his house to talk I was pretty nervous and they tickled each other in front of me witch was very unconfrotable. Here's the thing guys, I actually don't consider myself a very anxious person when it comes to relationships or talking to adults, it's just that these people here and their culture just doesn't click well with me at all (since I grew up alone and discovering things on the internet.) We went out one time and it was actually pretty great, I was thinking I looked ugly the hole time while talking but it was still really fun. So here I seat, alone in my room instead of studying wondering if I should do this and wasting brain space on this person that might not even think of me ever. I don't know if I want this and I dont know if I should do this regardless. I would if reaching out wasn't such a challenge when trying to maintain a stable mental health and focus on your passion. I want to be better, the person I know I am and I dont know if this is a step back or forward. Please give me advice, I feel really lost.",

379,"I have been complaining about my mental health for over 5 years to anyone who can help, but they all refuse to listen. They see me as too perfect to even hear me out. This is really just an r/offmychest. [RANT]I don't really expect anyone to read this. I'm writing this to get it off my chest. If you do choose to read, lmk if you've ever had a similar situation with family members and doctors and friends. This is mostly for my own sanity, though. PS sorry for bad grammar and spelling, I'm on mobile. ___________________ I'm going to keep pushing forward. I am not quite to the point of suicide yet, but I am afraid that I won't be able to go on my entire life like this. 80+ years like this? That bums me out just thinking about it. the tldr of this is that I never feel alive. Im always zoned out, in a daze and brainfog. I can't focus, and I live my life seeking stimulation, instead of things that make me actually happy. I'm neither happy nor sad. I haven't truly experienced either in a long time. I will be able to pull through a few more years though. Since I'm not especially sad, and I fear death more than anything else, it'll be a while before it comes to that. But I fear that will eventually be the end of me. Some important information about me. I do really well in school (a+'s all over the place, even in AP classes) and well on the in person AP exams (I've passed AP computer science exam, AP calculus AB exam, and AP us history exam) and did decent on my SAT (1390/1600 which is considered average among people going to college, and well above average for all high schoolers. I did especially well on the math, with a 740/800. That's impressive because I have dyscalculia, meaning I can't tell you what 7 + 5 is off the top of my head. Added some difficulty on the no calculator section, as you can imagine). Oh, and I got a perfect 100% score on the California standardized testing, which includes math and English and some science. I am a 17yr old male, going into 12 grade in a week or two. I attend school online, because the in person school that I was attending was really screwing me up l mentally. I left the school with a very strong case of dyscalculia. Fortunately, ever since I've left in person school, I've been able to learn coping mechanisms for dyscalculia (although I don't think I will be curing myself anytime soon), heal, and learn everything from algebra to calculus correctly. I'm glad I got away from that shit, I can't even begin to imagine how fucked up I would be if I stayed any longer. Anyways, that's just a little backstory. Something that has been concerning me for the last 5 or so years has been a slow cognitive decline. I know that, typically, people have ADHD their entire life. In my case, I've only really taken notice the past 5 years. I've noticed, however, that it seems to be getting worse. Maybe it's an illusion though, caused by the fact that I don't renember my younger years well. Here are my problems: - I miss a great deal of information that comes my way. My memory isn't great, but even worse than my memory is paying attention to and processing the information to begin with. Your name? Where you're from? What you enjoy doing? It's in one ear and out the other. I almost never remember a person's name the first time around. It takes a few goes before I get it. - Understanding what you're saying. What you're saying sounds to me like a TV on 5% volume, playing in the background, while I'm slowly falling asleep. I truly care about what people have to say, but keeping up mentally is a terrible experience. I feel so inattentive to people at all times. And, oftentimes, I'm concerned about what I'm going to say next (social anxiety does that to people- I HAVE to plan what I say before I say it.) Im not slow or anything, as evidenced by my decent test scores and whatnot, but I can't focus and apply myself when communicating with people. - almost nothing gives me the mental stimulation I need. Video games, which are supposed to be one of the best mental stimulators available, don't do shit for me. I zone out almost immediately, and it just isn't an enjoyable experience. I can only really force myself to play a game like CSGO for maybe 30 minutes at a time. I then proceed to get bored. The only thing that seems to work for me is running. I've found myself getting absolutely addicted to running. I easily spend 1-3 hours running, and i absolutely would go longer if it wasn't for hip pain. This makes sense- exercise boosts serotonin and dopamine levels, the latter of which is an important function of ADHD medication. I do this despite the enormous pain and physical discomfort. It seriously puts my mind at ease. But nothing else works. I've experimented with both none and a ton of coffee before, neither of which seem to have any effect. Running is the only thi g I know of that makes my brain feel correct. - I can't finish projects if they take any longer than about 2-3 days. I lose enthusiasm so quickly. Which is unfortunate, because I always start off with an insane amount of energy. Everyone around me knows just how energetic I can be. But they don't really know that I never have enough in the end. - Worst of all, I feel like a walking zombie. I don't really feel much anymore. I'm always indifferent and melancholy inside. I act happy for those around me, but I personally always feel ""meh"". I'm always dazed and zoned out in a miserable brain fog- except for when I run. This is the one thing that I hate most. I don't remember feeling this way when I was younger, but maybe I just forgot about my younger self, idk. I can't even call myself depressed per se, because I never feel deep sorrow, either. My emotion and consciousness is simply drained out of me, and video games or other activities don't usually snap me out of this. I haven't felt alive for a long, long time, aside for whenever I run. So I guess the point of this post is just to get this stuff off my chest. I don't expect anyone to reply. The thing that really gets me is that I have never met anyone who understands what I'm going through with this damn brain fog and frustrating lack of focus, and my insatiable desire for mental stimulation. Because of my grades and scores, no one will believe me when I tell them that I can't focus. I can't even read things that interest me for more than a couple of seconds without zoning out (which I find especially insane). Getting through my reading for school is hell, because I have to reread everything at least 3 times before I read it without zoning out. I can clearly tell that my mother has ADHD herself, but she doesn't quite believe it when I tell her this. it's an endless cycle of her telling me that this and that are normal, since life with ADHd is all she's ever known. My father doesn't have ADHD, but when I tell him about it, he is in denial. He thinks of me as a perfect person. He's not in denial when talking about my brother, however, who's been actually diagnosed with ADHd by a psychiatrist. Doesn't matter anyways though, I don't see my dad very often. And if I don't want to burst his bubble ig. They will not take me to a psychiatrist because my grades are good (the only reason why my grades are good is because I spend 12+ hours on school dialy). They think I'm just tired when I can hardly understand what's going on, what they are saying, what we are doing, etc. I can't focus anymore, and I feel completely zoned out all the time. I told my doctor last time I did a checkup, he told me it was no big deal, that I should meditate, keep an eye on my diet, etc, all of which I have tried. My parents aren't abusive. They just don't want to believe that their ""awesome"" kid with good grades can be so fucked up. They took my brother to a psychiatrist to deal with his ADHD, and my parents are understanding of my sister's depression and GAD. As for me, well, I must be perfect. I am the youngest, btw, and my other two siblings are now off to coege. I don't k ow if what I described is ADHD or something else. But I need mental help at this point, to find out what the fuck is wrong with me. I know something is wrong. I am not malnourished, I am not dehydrated, I have sufficient vitamins, I eat a proper amount every day, etc. Put simply, the few people who are capable of helping me refuse to do so. Since I'm not ready to end my life yet, there is literally no way out of this, and I just have to endure. Hopefully getting this off my chest helps. PS you're amazing if you read this entire rant lmao!",
380,"My success story. (Trigger warning)I don’t think anyone is going to read this since it is going to be long, but I find it therapeutic to share my experience. When I was in 7th grade I was dating a guy. We were constantly breaking up and getting back together. I knew he was a bad person, yet he would convince me to give him another chance. It was like this for 2 years. At the beginning, he started judging me. And then he started verbally abusing me. He told me everything I did wrong and made me feel so weird for normal things. He started controlling who I hung out with, and who I got close with. He started stealing my lunch and eating it in front of me, saying I could lose a couple of pounds. This lead me to be briefly anorexic. He started physically abusing me. It was small at first, like just grabbing me too tight. Then it turned into shoving. He did it at school too. I knew this behavior wasn’t right. But he was my first boyfriend and it didn’t know how truly horrible he was. It was a cycle: I’d break up with him, he’d get me back and be an amazing boyfriend for a couple of weeks, and then he would start to be horrible again. The summer before high school is when things escalated. He started leaving more bruises on my body. At that point it was just from grabbing me too hard. It became a running joke in my school that I had high pain tolerance because I was dating him. The first time we had sex I was 14 and it was consensual. It was both of our first times. But it was like it woke a demon inside him. He wanted more than I could give and that’s when he started forcing me. I only really remember the first and last time. The first time it was a blow job. I was so confused as to why he was making me do it and I was crying the whole time. I though if I cried he would stop, but he didn’t. Months past of this and I can’t remember anything but I know stuff happened. The last time was the worst. My little brother who is a year younger than me but has Down syndrome was in the room. He started raping me and at this point, I just laid there and tried not to think about what was happening. My little brother noticed something was wrong and pulled my boyfriend off of me saying “get off my sister”. Something inside of me snapped. I told a friend and he told me that it was rape. I was confused because I didn’t think boyfriends could rape girlfriends. I thought that was just a “man lurking in the bushes” sort of deal. I broke up with him but my life only got worse. He stalked me almost all of high school. He followed me to my classes while harassing me. He punched me in front of my friends. He would threaten me. He blackmailed me constantly. He sent me videos of him taking a bunch of pills trying to kill himself because of what I thought about him, but when I showed my dad the video he zoomed it on the pills. They were Advil. He sent me a video of him taking 10 Advil. He vandalized my art that was put out into the hallway and would try any excuse to be around me. I got a school restraining order but it only protected me by 10 feet. And since I couldn’t prove anything, it worked both ways. So he would constantly go to the school to tell them I’m spreading rumors and breaking contract. It’s been 7 years since then and I would be lying if I said this doesn’t still affect me. Sometimes I get angry or depressed, but I just started going to therapy and I love it. I feel like I am feeling a million things at once when I think about the whole situation. But right now I feel proud. Because I got through that without a ton of support from anyone else. My abuser barely graduated high school and I am one year away from getting my degree. I am truly happy now. I have a cat that I adore more than most people and I have a boyfriend that loves me, respects me, and values me. I have an awesome job that I am proud of and cute new apartment. From 2012-2017 I was ready to end my life, but now I am thriving. It gets better. It really really does.",

386,"I just want my life to end, but i'm not ready to do itI'm just not made for this world, i can't love, i can't deal with a workplace, i don't have taste for anything anymore. I just want to end it all, jump in front of a train at full speed",
387,"Finally getting into inpatient detox - I'm ready to end this period of my life (warning, long post incoming).Hey guys, I've been drinking heavily for about 4 years now, with it getting progressively worse over time. Currently I drink 1-2 Steelies/Nattys during the day and another 12-18 beers a night, or 750ml+ of vodka. I'm 140 lb so it's pretty hard on my body. I lost my job (actually not due to my drinking, surprisingly but that's a whole 'nother issue that pisses me off) and since then have been living with family. My grandparents need full time care so I've been supporting my habit by doing housework, cooking, yard work etc in exchange for cash. I feel like I can't rejoin the real workforce due to my drinking issues. I've had a chemical dependency evaluation in the past because I wanted to see a therapist/psychologist since I believe I have some long time undiagnosed mental illness, but obviously they wouldn't admit me to a program unless I went through a rehab program first. My consular was a total bitch and seemed entirely disinterested in me and/or her job. That turned me off from the program and I continued with my crippling alcoholism. Finally, this week I decided enough was enough. I'm sick of living like this and went back for another evaluation. This time the consular was a wonderful woman who seems to genuinely want to help me. I've been put on an ""urgent"" list and will have a bed within two weeks to detox. Until then I am trying to maintain to avoid withdrawals but not get drunk every night. I'm done with this period of my life and ready to move on.",
388,"Well guys, I sincerely need karma.There will be mentions of rape in this thread, so please be aware before continuing this post. . . . I’m a 26yo female from TX. I work night shift as pest control and I’ve done somewhat decent for myself lately, considering the abandonment from my mother, and complete disconnect from my father. I have no siblings, and I’m not extremely close to any of my cousins/aunts/uncles considering they live stares away. Anyway, my position at work is 5pm-5am, so basically graveyard. One night, when I was getting off of work (I work in a very rural area, there are some homes nearby, but it’s mainly a wooded area). As I was leaving the office (I’m always the last to leave) I was sexually assaulted (raped). It was the most horrifying thing to ever occur in my life. I still feel absolutely disgusting, degraded, and like I’m not worth a singe fuck. In my early teen years I was a pot head, and from the PTSD of being abandoned by both parents, I was suicidal and a self harmer. Since the age of 18, I’ve slowed way down on self harm, but now, my world has come crashing down. Since I was raped, I’ve been extremely withdrawn, lost my job, and I’m pretty much fucked. I missed my period and fucking guess what, I’m pregnant. I do not want this baby, and I can not afford an abortion (with assistance from some organizations it still boils down to 348$, that I do not have. I’m so beyond ready to end my life. Guys, please, I need a friend at this point. Mentally I can NOT handle this. This is the absolute worst thing that could’ve ever happened and idk if I can survive this if I don’t get that abortion. I’m contemplating on trying at home methods, but I’m honestly scared. Any advice/tips/ anything? Please 😭. The only friend I had suggested I post here, as the people here are usually non judgmental, and very supportive. I honestly don’t know what to do or where to turn. Please.Help.Me ((Edited to add: I’ve got 85$ to put toward the abortion, but the issue is, if I don’t make it to my non-surgical appointment tomorrow for the abortion, I can’t have it done legally as I’d be over the legal timeframe to do so 😭)) and I really need to post in r/borrow or r/assistance to hopefully get funded for the procedure by the morning 😭",
389,"I need help, but I'm too scared to get itThrowaway so this doesn't bite me in the ass. I hate my life. I can never find any drive to do anything, I've stopped caring about hygeiene or appearance, I can't sleep without getting paranoid and scared, leading me to become sleep deprived, I have to sleep with a light on, which still doesn't work at all, I can't even go anything outside my bed when it's dark, I'm angry at everything, and I want to die. Those are just some of my issues. The truth is, I really don't want to die. Thinking about suicide just makes me tear up. I have a whole future ahead of me, and I don't want to lose it. I want to live my life, be in a relationship, and see the world. I'm not ready to end my life. Yet my mind is constantly pushing me to do it, to harm myself, and even hurt my family when things really get dark. I want help so bad. I want to talk to a professional, I want to feel better about myself, and finally shut the part of me that wants to hurt up. Yet I'm too scared too. I don't know if my family will ever believe me, or just tease me even more. I also feel like the only way I could ever get help, is if I try to kill myself. I hate feeling like this, and I just want professional help. I'm so confused and scared of myself and my future now. TL;DR: I have severe issues, and I'm too scared to find help for them.",
390,"My abortion saved me from my domestic abuser.I already had one child and was being beaten on a daily basis. When I tried to leave I was stalked and beaten to the point where I almost died. I tried to leave so many times, everyone had abandoned me, I was homeless (meaning staying with him was my literal only option) and I was using opiates to cope with the pain of daily punches and kicks to my head. I had nowhere to go and no to help me. No car, shitty job, and me and my infant were trapped with her father. When I went to get my abortion I was terrified. It was a surgical abortion so they medicated me, and when I came out of it immediately after the procedure, I laughed and smiled and was giddy that I wasn't bringing another child into this MESS. I promised myself I would get out of his house. I started saving money and looking for better jobs and got into a medically assisted recovery program, but it wasn't enough to change my entire life. My husband caught wind of the birth control I was taking and sabotaged me, knowing I was planning on leaving. He found the $1000 I had FINALLY saved up and he stole it from me, and then pretended he knew nothing about it. I was ready to end my life. I couldnt take it any more but I knew if I died he would have my daughter alone for the rest of her life, neglected and eventually abused like me. So I stayed. I started gaining weight and I couldnt figure out why. I regularly went 6 months without a period due to stress, and other than weight gain I had no other symptoms. Turns out, by the time my husband allowed me to use the car for a doctors appointment, I was 18 WEEKS PREGNANT. I tried to ask my doctor if it was still possible to end the pregnancy, and made me feel like a piece of garbage for even asking. When I tried to look online, all I could find were horror articles about ""late term abortion"" and my depression was the worst it had ever been. I called my mother, who I was not close with, and begged her to come get me and my daughter, and to hide me away for a while so I could get my shit together. &#x200B; Because of the delayed prenatal care and the punch to the stomach, while I was 24 weeks pregnant, my second daughter was born deaf and disabled. Now, I have two children. I have a good job and make a middle-class salary. I have a house where JUST ME and my two girls live (no boyfriends allowed), and I kill myself working to support my girls because . my e-husband refuses to pay child support and anytime I try to bring him to court he just quits his job. His girlfriend supports him and they live in her mother's basement. My children are safe, well fed, clean and happy and that is all I could have ever asked for. It has been hard, lonely, stressful, and I wish I had better medical care during my pregnancies. I could have left him so much sooner, I could have stopped all the brain trauma and bodily injury, I could have given my first daughter so much more in life if I had had access to REAL woman-focused medical care. I don't regret a thing and my second daughter is AMAZING. But I do wonder where my life would be if I had actual choices in what happened to my body. I had dreams once. Now I have kids, and my only dream is that I don't fuck them up and that I keep them safe. &#x200B; Don't take for granted your safety and bodily autonomy. It can be taken away so easily.",
391,"no hormones?i posted about detransing in here before, but while i was on T, it freaked my uterus out and caused pain so bad i could not even lay down comfortably and was unable to stand and walk. i had a hysterectomy because of that and back then i thought i would be on T for the rest of my life and didn't think i would follow through with detransing. well obviously the worst came to worst and it happened. but due to no longer having needles and syringes i have been off hormones for 3 weeks now. my endo does not have an available opening until the 17th of july. i am essentially on no hormones and then had to choose between T and E as my body no longer produces any hormones. pros and cons, E is obviously the best and so i am 100% detransing. but... i need hormones in my body to function. i have a month supply of T left. no E. i will call my primary doctor to see if she can help but... has anyone else been in this situation? i honestly have no clue what to do right now. i decided to stop T but now i might need to continue it for a month? at this point i am ready to end my life and make sure it works this time, too. it's just a goddamn mess. UPDATE: my mom is a nurse and said my primary doctor should be able to and she can normally get me in relatively quickly especially for something like this. so everything should be okay now i am hoping! UPDATE: my primary doctor is not able to for some reason. my endo cannot get me in until the 17th. it's been 3 weeks since i took T; will i be okay without hormones for 5 more weeks?",
392,"I work at a small town gas station (part 7)[Part 1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/9odbtc/i_work_at_a_small_town_gas_station/) [Part 2] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/9oouik/i_work_at_a_small_town_gas_station_part_two/) [Part 3] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/9pktq0/i_work_at_a_small_town_gas_station_part_3/) [Part 4] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/9tqaop/i_work_at_a_small_town_gas_station_part_4/) [Part 5] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/9u4hw7/i_work_at_a_small_town_gas_station_part_5/) [Part 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/9vyrtv/i_work_at_a_small_town_gas_station_part_6/) Quick disclaimer, the following entry contains scenes of explicit violence of the old-lady variety. Reader discretion is advised… Also, the word “fuck” gets used like six times. So if you’re a kid, maybe don’t read it. Also, you should probably get off the internet until you’re older. Go outside or read a book or something, I don’t know. I’m not your dad. Do whatever, I guess… Anyway, without further ado, here’s what happened next: *** I kept my eyes locked on the elderly woman while I pumped her gas. She stood right next to me the whole time, returning the eye contact with just as much intensity. She was a tiny old thing, skinny and frail and unassuming… the perfect killer. “What are you holding that baseball bat for?” she asked. I narrowed my eyes at her and responded, “Wouldn’t you like to know?” Finally, the nozzle switched off to indicate that the tank was full, and I pulled it out and put it in its cradle, still keeping eye contact with her, never daring to turn or look away. “Well? How much was it?” She asked. “Look and see for yourself,” I said, gesturing towards the pumps. “I can’t see that far without my glasses. Would you be a dear and tell me what it says?” “If you can’t see the price on the pump, maybe you shouldn’t be driving.” “What are you, my doctor?” We both stood there in awkward silence for a moment longer, until finally she turned and climbed into the driver seat, calling back to me, “Why don’t you come over here for a second? I’d like to give you a tip for being such a kind young man.” “That’s okay. No tip necessary.” She stepped out of the car again with a small yellow purse in her hands--an image of Pikachu’s face proudly displayed across the front--and reached inside to pull out a single piece of hard candy wrapped in cellophane. She extended it in my direction with a friendly, “Here. I’d like for you to have this. As a token of my sincere gratefulness.” “Put it on the roof.” “What?” “Put the candy on the roof of the vehicle, then step away from it.” She did as I asked. “More, please.” She took another step back. “More, Aggie.” She took another step back. I walked over to the candy, grabbed it quickly, then stuffed it into my pocket. “Okay, thanks for stopping by. You have a wonderful night.” I turned and made my way back towards the gas station as fast as I could run. I’d almost gotten to the doors when I felt myself suddenly being lurched backwards hard enough that I dropped the bat onto the ground. I looked over my shoulder to see old Aggie standing there with a grin, her hand wrapped around the slack of my hoodie, holding me in place. “Aren’t you forgetting my receipt?” she asked with an insane glimmer in her eye. I quickly took off my hoodie and jumped away from the old woman… or whatever it was pretending to be the old woman. In the half second it took me to lose my outerwear, she had switched sides on me. Now standing right between me and the gas station. “Look, lady, I’ll get you a receipt. Hell, I'll get you *all* the receipts. But you’re going to have to go and wait in your car. Deal?” I looked at the ground where I’d dropped the bat, but Aggie had already reached and stepped over it, moving ever closer to me. I stepped back. She stepped forward. I stepped back. She stepped forward. This didn’t make any sense, I was so much taller than her, matching each step, but somehow she was closing the distance, walking me away from the safety of the building one step at a time until finally my back hit the side of her vehicle. “Oh, Jack, you poor little thing. Let me put you out of our misery already.” She reached into her Pikachu purse and pulled out a nail file. “I can make it clean if you want. One quick jab.” She demonstrated the motion with a malevolent smile. “And then it all goes away. All your stress gone. All your problems no more. I’ll do you this favor and everyone will be better off. Eh? What do you say?” She was now within striking distance, but something told me I wasn’t going to be much of a match against her in hand-to-hand mortal combat. “Tempting, but how about a counter-proposal? How about you leave me alone, and then neither of us has to die tonight? Pretty good idea, right? And that way, we don’t have to worry about *OH MY GOD WHAT’S THAT!*” I screamed and pointed over Aggie’s head. She spun around to see what I was talking about, and I took the opportunity to dive into the open passenger side door of her car, then right through to the driver’s side, pausing for a split second to check and see if maybe the keys were still in the ignition. But of course they weren’t, so I kept moving, jumping down and prepping to make a break for it. But somehow Aggie was already there on the other side, waiting for me like a slightly less creepy Pepé Le Pew. *”Shit!”* I yelled. “Going somewhere?” “No, no, I just dropped my contact lens. Would you mind helping me look for it? You check out here. I’ll go inside.” I looked all around for any kind of weapon or weapon-like object. Given what I’d already seen, I knew I could never outrun this old bird to my baseball bat, and the only thing on me was a cheap cell phone and two-and-a-half decades worth of bad decisions, neither of which were going to do much good. I was getting desperate. I silently cursed that stupid bounty hunter for not leaving me his can of mace, but then I saw the small fire extinguisher hanging from the column by the pump. “Jack, it’s been fun. It’s been real. It’s been real fun, but it’s time already. Why fight it? Nobody’s going to miss you. You’re nothing but a simple nut case.” “Yeah, well you’re nothing but a simple nut *face!”* She gave me a puzzled look, then asked, “Wha-” Before she could get the word out, I’d already grabbed the extinguisher and swung it as hard as I possibly could. It connected with her old-feeble-lady face with an incredibly gratifying *thonk* that echoed against the gas station and launched the woman onto the ground. *Whoa, that was incredible,* I thought. *I actually did it. I beat up an old woman.* Well, when I think of it like that, it’s not really something to brag about. But then things got worse. A lot worse. “Well, well, well,” she said as she sat up, “Looks like somebody thinks he can fight... Is that all you got, ya pussy?” I nearly dropped the extinguisher at the sight of her. The woman’s skull was dented inside itself, Her nose flattened into the face, with blood pouring freely from the three inch tear in her upper lip. I caught myself. This was not the time to freeze up. This was the time to finish what I started before it was too late. I gripped the extinguisher, stepped forward, closed my eyes and swung the weapon straight down like I was chopping firewood. Again, it connected with a loud, wet *thonk,* and I could feel the splatter of hot blood bounce up onto my face. Just to be sure, I swung it again. She was on the ground now. *thonk* I swung one more time, smashing into what was left of her face, then I stood up, took a step back, opened my eyes, and instantly wished I hadn’t. It was a pretty nasty sight to behold. I took a long, deep, breath and tried to relax. But then old Fake-Aggie had to ruin that. She sat back up again and made a hideous vocalization from her mouth opening. Her tongue flapped around wildly. The bottom jaw was barely hanging on, one of her eyes dangled out of its socket, and brain matter dripped from the broken crevice in the center of what was once her head. “Uhh… sorry, what was that?” She put her hands up to hold her jaw in place, then proceeded to move her mouth hinge manually as she spoke these next words. “Oh... Jack.. you dumb bitch… you had better... fucking... run.” She dropped her jaw and reached for the ground, and I realized that this crazy lady was about to stand up and go for round two. I dropped the fire extinguisher, booked it around the car to retrieve the baseball bat, then came back to where Aggie was still attempting--and failing--to get herself to her feet. I lifted the bat over over my head and said, “I’m sorry.” She gurgled some words at me that I couldn’t even begin to understand, but I like to pretend it was something like “Go ahead and finish me off and don’t let this action burden your conscience for the rest of your life because you are completely justified and forgiven.” But really, who knows? I swung the bat against the top of her head, laying her out yet again. Then I proceeded to smash her brains in, swinging over and over until there really wasn’t much of anything left. I was exhausted, and Aggie was dead, and I needed to sit down and wrap my head around this whole thing. I leaned against the hood of her vehicle while I tried to think. I made it. It was a little touch and go there for a second, but I got through. And now I had yet another dead body to worry about. I could probably wrap her up in a tarp and stuff her in the walk-in cooler, but then I’d have to figure out something to do with her vehicle. And what was I going to say- The driver side mirror on her Jeep Wrangler exploded off just a few inches from my face, and I felt something stinging my ear. What the… was that a gunshot? Where did a gunshot *OH SHIT!* At the edge of the gas station parking lot, there was a black Toyota Tundra parked with the lights turned off. The drivers side window was rolled down, and the driver was pointing a rifle at me. I dropped to the ground and army-crawled under the Jeep as another shot rang out, hitting the back bumper. Then another barely missed me and hit the back right tire, which whistled and quickly deflated. Whoever was in the truck, he was ready to end my life, and right now I was a sitting duck. I scooted out from under the car, trying to keep the gas pump between me and the truck, but then I heard the engine roar to life, and the Tundra sped into the parking lot and came to a screeching stop right on the other side of the pump. I looked at the ground in front of me to see the pool of old lady blood spreading across the pavement and wondered if maybe *this* wasn’t the person I was supposed to kill. Another shot rang out, ricocheting off the hood of the Jeep. Then the truck engine cut off, and a second passed before the driver yelled out “Hey! Jack! Is that you?” I knew that voice. It was a guy from town named Brian. He was a few years younger than me, and like most people from around here, he was short tempered, stupid, and well-armed. “Yeah, it’s me.” “Shit yes! I get to kill one of them gas station re-re’s.” I could hear the sound of his door open and him stepping out onto the ground. “Wait! You don’t have to kill me!” “I don’t *have* to kill you,” he said. From the sound of his voice, I could tell that he was right on the other side of the pump. Just a couple feet away. “I *get* to kill you.” I could hear the sound of him fitting a shell into his shotgun, then the click-clack of the round going into place. My bat wasn’t going to be much use right now, and not just because I accidentally dropped it when the firing started and it had rolled away and I had no idea where it went. Agatha’s Pikachu purse was sitting right next to the remains of her body, soaking in blood and brain matter. I crawled towards her and reached for it, hoping that maybe there was something in there I could use. But as my fingers touched the purse, Aggie’s hand snapped up and wrapped around my wrist with a python grip. I screamed, stood up, and started kicking at her arm until she finally released and fell back into a slump. Then I turned around, coated in blood and holding a Poke-purse, to see Brian standing there with a shotgun. He was donned head to toe in camouflage, with a camo cap and a confused smile. I stepped away from Aggie and Brian walked over to inspect my unholy work. I could see he wasn’t in much of a hurry, but his finger was on the trigger and it wouldn’t take him but a second to raise his weapon and end me. “Now, I know how this probably looks. It looks bad, right? It looks like I just beat an old woman to death with a baseball bat.” “And a fire extinguisher,” he added. “Yeah, and a fire extinguisher. But I can assure you, that’s not what happened here.” He looked away from Aggie and brought his eyes up to meet mine, saying, “I don’t give a fuck.” “Oh. Okay.” “So you’re a killer, huh? I always suspected that about you.” I tried taking a few steps back because hey, that always seems to work out, right? But Brian just started walking forward, keeping the same distance between us. “I’m not a killer, Brian. This is just a colossal misunderstanding.” “I can’t wait to see what it feels like to kill a person. They’ll probably give me a reward for it. Killing the guy that brutally murdered Mrs. Sistrunk.” “No, not really. I mean, the justice system can be pretty tricky. You should probably think this through.” “You wanna make a run for it? Go ahead, I’ll let you. Start running. I’ll even count to ten before I start shooting.” Of course, I didn’t believe him. The second I couldn’t keep him talking anymore, he was going to shoot to kill. There was no way around it. But then I saw Aggie rise, and start walking. She was right behind him, her arms extended, something terribly off about the way her face-debris was reconstructing itself. I made a split-second decision... to do nothing. To not to say anything to Brian. And I’ll always wonder if he would have looked if I’d given him a warning. Or if that would have even mattered. I like to think it wouldn’t have made any difference... The thing pretending to be Aggie wrapped her arms around Brian’s torso from behind. “Hey! What the fu-” Then she started squeezing, tighter, and tighter, until blood erupted from Brian’s mouth and he fell over at the crease in his middle where Agatha had nearly squeezed him in half. And amazingly, that wasn’t even the grossest thing I was seeing. Aggie herself was *growing back her head.* Half a dozen slimy black tendrils wiggled out of the opening in her neck like giant slugs, attaching to the meat and bones and tongue and eyes, and squeezing them back into place until she was a black and red skull with a head full of white hair, and then she jerked Brian backwards and bit into him. More blood sprayed from his neck where her teeth had attached, and the black slugs extended from of her mouth and nose and into the fresh neck wound on her victim. His gun clacked to the ground and I took another step back. I’ve seen some shit, but *that* was some whole other level crazy. Brian’s skin went pale and then white with a face frozen into a look of eternal horror as the slugs drained every ounce of blood from his body, and once he was spent and dried out, Agatha let his corpse drop hollowly to the ground. She reached up to where the slug tendrils had reformed her wrinkly, broken skin, then she grabbed it with both hands and ripped off her own face like an old fleshy mask, revealing a new, wet face underneath. One that looked just like the old one, only with no wounds or tears or blood. Like a snake shedding a skin, she had molted into another perfectly normal Agatha. She smiled at me for a moment until she abruptly doubled over and barfed about a gallon of dark, lumpy blood all over the pavement. While she was vomiting, I finally snapped open her purse and reached inside for the nail file she’d shown me earlier, but that’s when my hands touched something else. Something large and metallic. I looked down to see that there was an enormous handgun inside her purse. Some kind of fancy revolver. Well, that’s better than a nail file. I pulled it out and pointed it at her. “Hey, Aggie! Dodge this!” She looked up to see me aiming the weapon and watched as I fired at her at point blank range… and totally freakin dodged it! She moved with the speed of a gazelle on crack, lurching to the side, snatching up the fallen body of Brian and holding him over her head. I fired again, but she had already darted away, ripping off Brian’s arm and flinging it in my direction like a boomerang. It collided with the gun hard enough to knock it free and send it skidding across the ground. I hugged my hand and started backing away, trying to see where the old lady had ended up, and then realizing that she was right next to me. She smiled. “You gotta be a lot faster than that, fuck boy!” *The radio gave me a seventy-six percent chance of out-matching this lady? Are you kidding!?* She took a swing at me. I saw it coming and jumped back, and even though my reflexes in that moment were uncharacteristically in tune, she still connected. Her claws snagged at my chest, leaving four neat rips in the front of my t-shirt. For a second, I felt pretty good, like I’d actually managed to dodge an attack for once. But then I felt it. The sharp pain of four parallel cuts sliced into my chest, and I could feel the blood running down my front. “Ow.” I said. Agatha licked her fingernails in an incredibly gross manner, but then she froze. Her eyes slowly widened, and her mouth dropped open. If I didn’t know any better, I’d say she actually looked scared. And then, she started to glow. Bright and green. And not for the first time that week, or day, or hour, or even minute, I found myself wondering… *What the hell is happening?* Agatha took a few steps backwards, and I realized that she wasn’t the one glowing. That aura of light was coming from directly behind me. I looked back to see the raccoon creature standing there, teeth on display, ears pulled sharply back, and glowing fiercely. “Easy there, Rita,” Agatha said calmly, “I don’t want any trouble with you.” The raccoon monster… “Rita” barked at her. The noise was even louder than the gunshots, and they made Aggie jump. “That’s right!” I screamed. “I have a pet dragon! Who’s the fuck boy now, huh?” In retrospect, I realize that my smack talk could probably use a little work, but cut me some slack. I’d just been through a lot. “Okay. Looks like we’re gonna have to call this one a draw,” Aggie said as she turned around and walked back towards her Jeep. She stopped along the way to pick up Brian’s arm, and then Brian’s shotgun, and then Brian’s the-rest-of-him. She got it all with one hand like she were simply collecting pieces of trash, then she chucked it all into the back of her vehicle and drove away on a flat tire. *** “Well… ?” I asked. Benjamin seemed annoyed. “Well what?” “I just… you know… this is usually the part where you interrupt my story. It’s a perfectly logical break, so I wanted to see if you had anything to add or criticize. Any theories to float around. Any insults or lectures about what I could or should have done better?” “No, Jack, I got nothing. We’re both in uncharted waters here.” “I was afraid you’d say that.” I took the whiskey and poured myself another round. “And that’s still not even the worst of it.” “Your friends?” “Yeah.” “Okay. Let’s get back to it, then.” *** Despite my hopes, Rita didn’t stick around for long. Once Aggie had gone, Rita turned and darted back into the woods before I could even say “thank you.” I went back inside and tried to calm down, tried to figure out what my next move should be. But after what I’d just seen, I knew exactly what we were really dealing with (more or less). Aggie was replaced. She was one of them. One of those things. She was strong. She was fast. She was able to regenerate and willing to kill. And for some reason, she had it out for me. There were dozens of others that the radio had already identified as being replaced, and those were just the ones we knew about. This was shaping up to be a lot worse than I’d thought. Daniel came in to start his shift a few hours later. When he saw me, he froze and asked, “You know your ear is bleeding?” I touched it and winced at the pain. He was right. A piece of Aggie’s mirror must have sliced it open after the bullet hit it. “I was not aware. Thank you.” “Were you also not aware that… uh… you look like a bear slashed open your chest?” I looked down at my t-shirt and the large circle of dried blood around the four scratch marks. “Oh yeah, you’re right. I guess it’s probably a little too late to get stitches, huh?” “Dude, are you okay?” “Yeah, why?” Daniel looked around the room, then asked, “Why don’t I take over the register and you can go get cleaned up?” “Great idea.” I hit the bathroom and ran some hot water, then I stripped down to my underwear and counted the bruises and scratches. That fight to the death ended up being a lot weirder than I’d expected. And in the end, the only person to die was some random passerby. Sure, he was trying to kill me, but I’m not completely sure he deserved to get slug-tongued to death by a headless Aggie vampire… oh wow… throw that on the pile of sentences I never thought I’d hear myself say. I cleaned my wounds best I could in the given situation, splashed some water on my face for good measure, then got dressed and went back out to the front. Before I got to the register, I realized that something was wrong outside. Once Daniel saw me, he blurted out, “Hey, Jack, I’ve been meaning to talk to you about my paycheck.” “Where’s the truck?” “What?” “There was a black Toyota Tundra outside by the pumps. Where is it?” Daniel looked out the window. “Oh, I guess he must have moved it after he finished pumping gas.” That’s when I saw that it was parked right outside the gas station in the spot closest to the door. “Who? Who moved it?” “What?” “Who moved the truck?” “You’re really trying to avoid answering this paycheck question, aren’t you?” “God dammit, Daniel, *who moved the fucking truck?”* “Jesus! Alright! It was that guy.” Daniel pointed behind me, and I turned to see a man dressed in all camouflage, with a camo hat on top. He was crouched down next to the fishing supplies, and his hands were full of junk food. He grabbed a lure, then stood and walked up to the register. As Brian walked past, he didn’t even acknowledge me. He dropped the items on the counter, let Daniel ring him up, then walked outside to his truck and drove away. “Everything okay, Jack?” I walked behind the counter, reached down and picked up my notebook where I’d written down all the names of everyone who had been replaced, then I jotted down Brian’s name at the bottom of the list with an asterisk next to it. Daniel tried again. “Jack?” “You’re fired, Daniel. I can’t afford to pay you anymore.” “Wow. Okay.” Daniel nodded, took off his name badge, and dropped it on the counter. “Well, that’s alright, I guess. I was planning on quitting anyway.” He grabbed a roll of Lotto scratch offs and said, “By the way, I’m keeping these.” “Knock yourself out.” With that, he left the store, and I picked up the phone and dialed Jerry’s number. It rang. And rang. And rang. And rang. And rang... And rang... [Continue](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/a0qw1b/i_work_at_a_small_town_gas_station_part_8/?)",
393,"Help, I'm starting to feel like we'll never escape (TW: suicidal ideation)I'm 25, my sibling is 20. 3 weeks ago or so my Nmom's outburst was so bad, I'd been fighting for so long & my health is falling apart... I literally started sobbing while locking up my bike next to work. I decided I was ready to end my life, I just wanted to let her win. Thankfully, my coworkers not only let me take the day off but also spent the day with me making sure I was safe. I decided the next day I had to move out or that's it, I'm ending it. I explained the situation to a few people I trust, all have been sweet & offered to help us. I've looked at several apartments & finally found a few I thought we could afford. We both make a bit above minimum wage, but now they are asking us both for formal rental history. We rent from nMom currently, paying to live under her roof with her as our roommate. I tried to explain the situation to the prospective places. My sibling has never even been able to live on their own & can barely leave the house for work because of their ptsd from the abuse. I have very little rental history from before I was manipulated into moving back in with nmom. This seems insurmountable & I wonder if anyone has any advice. One of the places told me to reach out to the ywca but they just said all their lawyers were busy?? I'm really clueless. I should add that we both have been saving for other things we needed, so the financial aspect is tight but we could make it for sure. The problem is no one wants to rent to us without formal rental history.",
394,"Sober life hasn’t been so greatLast summer I was using and I overdosed, it wasn’t intentional but I also wasn’t against the idea of dying. I remember turning on some Alice in chains and just nodding into blissful ness it was the best I’ve ever felt in my life until I woke up with a shit ton of paramedics surrounding me on my bedroom floor apparently my buddy (my only friend) tried to come over and I was greyish/blue and he called them. I wasn’t very grateful for him saving my life and that burns me inside to this day I never got to thank him as he died of an overdose 3 days later when I was at work I felt and still do feel extremely guilty for everything. My immediate response was I wanted to kill myself and I actually tried that time but some girl I was with at the time found me called the ambulance and flushed my entire stash. I woke up in the hospital with her and my family surrounding me it was the worst feeling of my life putting them threw this, the girl had never been around drugs and she almost watched me die. my family was constantly doing check ups after that n the reason I opted out of killing myself was my mom. I didn’t wanna put her threw that so I attempted a sober life. But sober life is just painful it’s almost been a year and it’s nothing but suffering I lost my job cuz of the incident, no one will hire me, everyone looks at me different now and all I ever think about is how much I wanna die as soon as I open my eyes in the morning it’s my first thought. All the reasons to stay alive are now gone so I’m ready to end my life or the very least the sobriety. I don’t wanna go on living like this but I just don’t know what to do anymore.",
395,I just lost my job this morning and i'm very ready to end it all. Life is just going to get worse until the day i die. I need to vent out my emotions so please hear me out. There is still a small part of me that wants to live.I'm not sure what I should expect from this subreddit but just wanted to vent anyways. I've had issues with depression and suicidal thoughts for most of my life. Seriously thinking about drowning myself in the ocean so that my body will never be found. My former manager expressed concern several times over the last year or so that my interactions with my colleagues were concerning. Most people thought i was disrespectful towards them and wondered that I should be less negative towards them. I barely tried to turn things around unfortunately because I'm so stubborn. But maybe it was a bandaid to a lifelong problem with depression. I have many issues to sort out if I'm not going to eventually kill myself. I'm feeling very overwhelmed by it all and it's all my fault and no one will care if I just disappear. Sorry if my post breaks any of the rules on this subreddit I'm just trying to keep it together.,

I do none of those things and eat as healthy as possible or at least that I know of and I have severe eczema all over my body that has grown to consume my life these past few years and pretty much turn me into a dreadful person All of my career goals, my ambitions... they’re all ruined because of this bs disease. I pretty much have nothing to live for. Not only does everyone that I once care about think that I am overreacting regarding how much pain I am in, and refuses to understand, but I will never find anyone who loves me for who I am anymore. Everyone turns a blind eye to my suffering and goes on enjoying their sweet lives. No one gives a shit. I can’t keep doing this.

Exactly a year ago on the 9th, my then 18th birthday, my then partner and I messed up in the worst of ways that eventually led to our breakup on the 23rd of December. I don’t hate them despite what they did to me and I did to them. Because of them, I am still alive to this day. They are the reason I didn’t end it last year, even if I do believe they manipulated me into not ending my life as they’ve admitted to manipulating me before. Exactly a week ago today, I felt loved and appreciated in a way I haven’t felt since I was just a little girl. I cried at 3am on my birthday not because I hate myself and I don’t want to live anymore. I cried at 3am on my birthday because, finally, for the first time in nine years, I was happy to be alive. I’m still lost, I think I messed up my life and there’s no way I can get it back, but I’m happy to be alive still. I’m glad I didn’t end my life a year ago. I still don’t believe it’ll get better for me, but honestly I couldn’t care less. I’m okay despite all that happened and what let me to where I am now. I don’t care if there isn’t any hope for me anymore, that’s fine as I have accepted I won’t be anything great. As long as I have my amazing friends and family, I’m fine.

I have a feeling the only time I might call is if I'm having suicidal impulses, but haven't had that happen since I've started seeing a therapist.

What do I do? .We have been together for 3 years in a wonderful, loving relationship but after much trying I do not wish to continue. As title says I was going to break up with him this week, and he had no idea. He has a history of depression (was previously hospitalized) and texted me today that he wrote a note yesterday and was planning to attempt today, but that he is instead going to check himself into a psych hospital after he gets off work, and that he needs my support again. I have always been his rock and he has been mine. Many times I have been the reason he hasn't killed himself, according to him My central issue is that I don't know if I should break up with him while in the hospital so I know he's 100% safe and can receive care; or if I should not upset him during this time and wait until he's out. If he wanted, I would still provide support and visitation because I'm still his best friend. But I don't want to drop the bomb like that while he's already having a terrible time . But I'm not going to be in a relationship i don't want, for however many months it takes for him to recover. However, if I were to break up with him when he got out, I'd afraid he'd attempt or get worse. So i'm not sure what to do. Please don't think of this as me being an asshole, please do not come to bully me. I love and care for the safety and wellbeing of this man more than anything in the world. He's my best friend.

408,"Finally lost the battle and now it's someone else's to fightBeen lurking here under another profile and finally decided to share my story which so closely resembles everyone else's here. It's a long one, so I put a TLDR at the end if you need to skip it. Around 2016, I was a somewhat fit guy (like running) that had a nice job in IT and had a pretty nice vehicle. I (M36) started talking to a fb friend after she (F31) commented on one of my posts. At the time, she was one week away from having her second child. As someone that tries to judge on character and not circumstance, I gave her the benefit of the doubt; father had left for the second time after finding out she was pregnant so he was out of the picture. I had never found someone that had so much in common with me as far as interests. She told me we were going to go running once she could again (she used to run marathons before getting pregnant). I saw her every day after work, we became official about a month and a half later. She had talked me into some things financially that were bad in hindsight; she wanted us to get our own place and to afford that, I should file bankruptcy so I wouldn't have a car payment and I could put save that much money to find a house to rent. She got a job across the street from me working the same hours, so she would just take me to work. Having strong feelings for her and the kids, I agreed. Everything was amazing with us until 6 months in. Her sister had moved back in with her mom as well and they did not get along. They had a very heated argument after her kids were asleep, which woke them up. I got the baby and her mom got the daughter who was crying at what she was hearing/seeing from her. After they had their spat, she came into the room where I was holding the baby. I asked her why she did that and what she was thinking... That's when things turned on me. How dare I make her feel like more shit than she already did and how dare I not support her in this. I'm lost at this point... I don't know what to say. She breaks up with me the next day. We had both said we are in love with each other at this point and I'm just left so confused by this. I contact her a week later to see if we can talk about things. That's when I find out from her that she is BP2 and has not been to therapy or taken meds in some time. She said that her insurance has kicked in and she is going to start seeing a psychiatrist again and find what meds she needs to be on. So that explains a lot and we get back together. I save up the money and we find a house for rent. We get settled in, I bought a car at a buy-here-pay-here lot and we're doing great with everything... until about 6 months in. I had broken my foot a month after moving into this house which means I stopped running and gained weight in the process. She could tell me she doesn't like skinny guys anyway, but the future is going to tell differently. I start feeling like I'm being attacked almost every day over everything. There is nothing I can say or do to make things better; everything is the wrong answer. Then one night when we plan to get intimate, it gets around bedtime and she starts seeming annoyed at the whole thing, so I don't even try. That's when she says we need to talk. I let her know there seems to be nothing I can say to her and everything seems like her way or the highway. She says she can't believe I feel that way about her and once again says thanks for making her feel like a piece of shit. The next day she tells me she's moving back in with her mom. I agree that it's probably for the best. Luckily, I have an old friend that was looking for a place to live since I couldn't handle all the bills myself (I paid rent and internet, she paid water and electric. Her part was around $250 a month). I hurt every day... I missed her and the kids; they were practically my own and called me dad. Two months later, I was calling her again. I apologized for not being able to handle the situation better. She apologized too. She had explained how stressed she was about paying those bills since she lost help from the state over child care; she was only having to pay half of $950 a month for the two kids' daycare, but lost that when they reviewed her pay with this new job so she had to pay it all at that point. I understood and told her I wish I had known about it before she left. I would have gotten a night job to help. Thanksgiving was coming up and she said it would be nice if I could be there too and I agreed. We got back together a week after but she did not move back with me because of the daycare expenses. A few months later, another episode. I just don't know what to do anymore. At this point, I had a better paying IT job but the hours only allowed us to see each other on the weekends. I was able to browse around the internet a lot at this job and I stumbled upon people talking about having bipolar disorder. I spend the better part of 4 hours reading about this stuff and after that, had a better understanding of it other than ""they get mad and sometimes cheat on you"". I decided to write her a letter explaining what I understand now and I really want to help with this. After receiving it, she texted back saying she is overwhelmed with my words and starts opening up to me again. Luckily, no breakup this time. She speaks with her psychiatrist some more and gets on different meds. These seem to be the ones that are going to work, because there were no more problems for quite some time. Then this past Christmas Eve comes along. It's the night my father passed due to heart complications. We had all stayed in the hospital when everything failed and they pulled life support and we all watched him die. I would go on to find out that face would never leave my mind which started giving me problems of my own. I stuffed the feelings down, left the hospital and went to her house to play Santa to the kids. I had no time to process any of this. I had responsibilities as a father myself. We'll come back to that in a minute... She had been working at another place for better pay, but something was going on at the office she worked; she was getting fiberglass in her fingers and back (this is a desk job). The ER doctor dismissed it due to her disorder and discharged her with no instructions or treatment. With that, she couldn't do anything about it at work where the owner and her manager didn't take it seriously. She decided to quit and I fully supported her in that decision. I would help her until she found something better. It was a couple weeks before father's day and we went somewhere in her car. I got annoyed with all the trash and things in her car and constantly having to move it just to sit down. When we got back, I cleaned it out within 15 minutes. She said ""babe, you didn't have to do that"" and she appreciated it. The next weekend, it's full of garbage again. I never really said anything before because I know she didn't have a lot of help during the week, but now she's not working and it's like this? Everything was going great that weekend, I took to the kids to my mom's house to swim and go for pizza like I do every weekend so she can have time to sleep in and take care of things. However, by the end of the weekend, she said something was bothering me and she said I needed to talk to her about it. Against my better judgement, I said how I cleaned her car out and a week later it's full of trash again. Her initial response; well if that's a problem, then why are you with me? Nothing about she will work on that or any other discussion; just straight to suggesting we break up. She says she hasn't had time this week because her oldest stays home and she took her to the park. I refrained from bringing up how that didn't take all week. She told me to leave and would call me when she's ready to talk. At this point, it's getting close to Father's Day and I'm getting scared I won't see the kids, so I make her talk to me. It's not pretty at first. She says we've grown apart, things like that and that I haven't been the same since my father passed. I finally broke down to her about seeing his face every day and how while he was in the hospital bed before surgery, he had the look of fear when looking at my mom. It was the first time in my life that I had seen that look on his face. She sat next to me and held my arm and said she is here for me and she still loves me and we are going to get help for me. She had started a new job doing the same thing, but this allowed her to work from home. I had just landed a job that would allow me to come by every day after work to help out, things were looking up. Until two weeks later, the week before the 4th of July. She had talked me to about no one has a positive attitude toward her son (completely not true) and she started showing signs of paranoia; people in her life who have never offended her are suddenly saying things that are making her mad. I should have seen the signs, I was able to get her to calm down, but she was distant... gave only short answers the rest of the day until it was time for me to go home. She said it wasn't a good weekend and I told her I know and before the conversation went any further, the youngest came outside where we were standing. She grabbed him by the arm knocking his food out of his hand and yelled at him to go back inside... This was after she told us no one gives him positive reinforcement. She made me leave. Her daughter's birthday was coming up so I asked her later that day what she needs me to get for the party. She told me not to worry about it and I told her she's basically my daughter too and she needs to tell me what to do. She said to keep it to myself and we are through. The next day, I started the new job that allowed me to have nights free. Three weeks in, I got yelled at by the owner for three days in a row with every question I asked. With this breakup, still the death of my father on my mind and just feeling generally depressed and scared, I quit. This whole time every attempt I made to talk to her was met with nothing. I was blocked on fb, assumed I was blocked on her phone as well... so I mailed her a letter trying to get her to talk to me. We finally talked a month later where she ripped into me. The only thing she said that was true was that I gained an unhealthy amount of weight. Other things were: I don't help financially with the kids, so she regrets them ever calling me dad. I am the most complacent person she has ever met (trying to get promotions at work weren't good enough). We don't have the same interests. Then the kicker: I should be over my father's death by now. I didn't say anything to this, I just listened. Because I knew she was manic, but I didn't know how to ask if she was still taking her meds without throwing her into more rage. I thanked her for the talk and left. I started delivering pizzas at night while looking for a new job in the field. I would text her every morning asking if she needed anything and it was usually ""no, but thank you"". Then one day, I asked if she wanted me to bring her lunch and she said she didn't feel like company today. I asked her if we could talk which was met with ""what is it, throwawayforBPSO?"" Saying my name like that, I knew it was going to be bad. I asked how much her meds were. She told me and asked why, so I told her I wanted to help if she needed it. She said besides the financial part, we just grew apart and she was completely over it. I asked if she was telling me there would never be anything between us again and she said yes. A couple weeks later, I asked if we could talk. She said no, we can't. Nothing after that. I found out two weeks ago, she is now with someone else. He was a lot like me when she first met me; skinny guy, lives alone, nice vehicle and job. **The TLDR;** For 3 years, she has turned my life upside down in every aspect then ghosted me. Now she will do it to someone else. And it has destroyed me. If you read all this, thank you. I know there is nothing that can help right now, but I will get therapy when I can as I now have issues of my own to deal with. Oh, and I have lost 30 pounds the past two months getting back to running. So at least I have that again.",

For example, a school-based OT might help a child with autism to participate successfully in classroom activities, and an OT in physical rehabilitation might help someone with paralysis to learn how to get dressed without the function of their legs (etc). OP: Since then, I finished high school, undergrad, grad school, and my boards. Also I found some new passions, adopted a dog, and fell in love NBD.

427,"I (33M) asked wife (35F) for divorce and she turned suicidalI (33M) asked me wife (35F) for a divorce. A lot of build up to that the prior few weeks. She lost it emotionally and turned suicidal. I really need advice on what to do. (BTW, this is a throwaway acct since I have a lot of family on Reddit.) To make a long story as short as possible; I live with my in-laws w/ my wife and two pre-teen girls. It's been this way for a three years now. I drive to work an hour and fifteen minutes each way, for a total of 2.5 hours of driving each day... 4 days a week. My job lets me work from home (the in-laws house) on Friday's. We had an opportunity a few months back to move into a new house. My Uncle / Owner of the place I work bought it for rental property, but decided to offer it to us as a rent to own deal. He offered it to me with a bonus of $1000 per month towards the mortgage, so we literally could be living in a new home for like $400 per month not including utilities. Also, it was only 15 minutes away from work. Sounded like an amazing offer to me, but not to my wife. She refused to move since it was an hour away from her family, and didn't want to move the kids from their school. My Uncle gave me a deadline on when he needed to know by, and I couldn't pull the trigger on it, so I lost out. My wife and my mother-in-law were completely against it and I didn't know what to do. Fast forward to now; we've been fighting a lot and it literally feels like I'm living with a roommate. I told her last weekend I wanted a divorce. She lost it. She bawled and screamed at me. She grabbed her keys took off while crying. Over the next hour she texted me suicidal texts on how I ""better give the girls a great life because she's not going to be around anymore"". She said she ""wouldn't go through a divorce again"".(she was previously divorced). I told her to stop talking like that and that we should focus on the girls now and co-parenting the best we can... and that it would damage the girls so badly if she went through with it. She then texts me ""goodbye, you'll never see me again"". I called her, but her phone is off. I leave the house and call the suicide hotline while driving around looking for her. Wow, were they so kind! I actually was crying on the phone telling her the situation. The woman on the phone (suicide hotline) told me to call the police if I couldn't find her soon. I go to a place I think she might be and they tell me she just left the house and is going shopping with her grandparents. WTF, why is she acting like she's going to commit suicide when she's out with her grandparents. She comes back home and later that night she's begging me to stay. My mind was so made up before all this but now I'm so unsure, because I fear for her safety. The next day the texts are rolling in while I was at work saying she will do ANYTHING if I stay. At this point, I don't want to stay but my heart breaks that someone cares so deeply for someone and that individual is going to abandon them. Also, this isn't the first time I've tried to leave over the past 10 years of marriage. She always went down the whole ""nobody loves me, and everyone wants to hurt me"". (Her previous husband was physically and mentally abusive). I've asked her to get help, but she refuses. So I would stay and our relationship would improve, but be back to terrible within a couple months at most. Please Reddit fam, help me out. TL;DR: Long time coming, asked wife for divorce and she left the house crying and saying she'll commit suicide. Now, is begging me to stay and claims willing to do anything for me. I was set on leaving, but now I'm torn on where to go from here.",

435,"Thoughts on the finale, from a formerly suicidal person [Possible Triggers]I've seen a lot of people these past few days upset and concerned that the Door, and the Good Place, is advocating suicide. I thought I'd throw my two cents in as someone who has actually attempted to kill myself and still struggles with suicidal thoughts from time to time. (I'm in therapy now and well-medicated, don't worry.) **Suicide is a violent act. There is no such thing as a peaceful suicide**. Suicide is far, far more than ""Person kills themself"". To reduce it to those terms is a disservice. All suicides leave a corpse. Most suicides in the United States either involve guns or drugs, so there is not only a corpse but blood and guts and vomit. It traumatizes those left behind. Suicide is horrible. I cannot say I disagree with attempted suicide being considered a crime, because I saw my wife and family's faces when I woke at the hospital. I hurt them, far more than if I had done a traditional crime in their presence. Suicide makes victims out of individuals and those that love them. It is a gut-wrenching, *entirely preventable* conclusion. **The Good Place Door, on the other hand, is a beacon of peace.** Everyone we saw pass through went through when it was their time. The Door is a passive thing, not active: it's just there. The choice to stay or go doesn't change. Chidi went through and didn't hesitate. Tahani didn't go at all and actively rejected it. **No one was forced and it was not violent.** Those who were left behind weren't blindsided by the passing. Saddened, yes--but not traumatized. It simply was the individual's time, after a life and afterlife well spent. I would argue that the Door is actually anti-suicidal, because no one passes through unwillingly before their time. Eleanor tried, but stopped herself, much like a healthy, un-depressed person would do before killing themselves. A person with depression who is actively considering suicide is often dissociative, meaning they aren't fully attached to their actions and may not be thinking of the consequences of actually dying--I certainly wasn’t. I didn't truly want to die, but rather wanted an existence that didn't feel meaningless and didn't cause me pain. ""You can sit on that bench as long as you like,"" is probably Janet's way of giving people the option to change their mind--as so often happens too late with real-life suicide. Suicidal thoughts don't ever tell you that you can change your mind. Never. It's just a constant stream of self-hate. The Door is entirely within a person's control to stay or go. We see this with Jason--he was ready, and then wasn't, so he didn't. When he did finally pass, he went with peace in his heart and joy on his face. TL;DR: The Door is a choice that reflects peace. Suicide is not. In addition, for anyone that needs it, [https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org). Never be scared to ask for help.

458,"My (24F) boyfriend (24M) had been degrading me for dropping out of medical school due to my suicidal thoughts. He thinks i'll be a housewife and leech off of him while he becomes a workaholic. Should I continue with the relationship?Hello everyone. I just completed my first semester of medical school and while I expected it to be extremely hard and stressful, I did not expect that it would make me suicidal and depressed. I've already been on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications since I was 17 and I've been managing pretty well. I'm currently on winter break and I realized that I cannot move forward for the sake of my mental health and it's also crushed any interest I had in medicine. I told my boyfriend over the break. He's a 4th year medical student so he understands the stress factors but not the suicidal/depressive tendencies. Although he hugged me and let me cry it out, he seemed to go silent. After I asked again and again, he went into this whole discussion about how I studied so hard for the MCAT and I invested so much time, money, and energy into this entire process including one semester for over 1.5 years. He said he worries that if I'm capable of dropping medical school like this, he's not sure if one day I will also give up easily on ""our relationship"" or our decision to have a child in the future. I was honestly shocked. I did not see any kind of correlation but he's adamant that what he says makes sense. He's not sure if I'm gonna give up on the relationship and ask for a divorce in the future. I do not believe in divorce at all UNLESS it's a 100% necessity so i don't know where he's getting this idea from. When I began dating him, I was hesitant on having kids but that was because I was 22 years old and unsure if I wanted a baby because I've never been in love nor had a reason to think about having a baby. After being with him, i was 100% sure I wanted to have a child with him. It wasn't for him only, I wanted to raise a child myself. I talked to him about kids often and even named our future daughter and we make jokes about it all the time. &#x200B; After that conversation, I was just crushed and went home the next day. Over the last two days, he's been talking about how he's doesn't want to work 70 hours till he's 70 years old to provide for his family. I dropped out of med school, I never said I'm done with my life. He made remarks about how he doesn't want me to be housewife and watching TV all day. And when I called him out on it, he said I mentioned wanting that once. I did, but it was a joke. Obviously I rather watch TV than study for 10 hours straight. He said he didn't want me working a job and wanted a career and when I asked what he meant by ""job"" and he said stuff like ""cashier"" cause it's temp. I used to be a cashier so I was offended that he would even think that I'm going to be a cashier for the rest of my life. His entire vibe about this is how he's screwed over and how his finance would be screwed. I'm not sitting here thinking I have a doctor boyfriend so I can just chill. I want to pave my own path and make a life for myself. &#x200B; I was already so stressed about medical school and I felt immensely better once I decided to drop out. I knew that my even my own amazing parents would support me. I took about 25K loan thats a complete waste but even then that is still the least of my worries. Being unsure of my future career is also another main worry but not as bad as what my boyfriend said. We talked on the phone last night and I told him that i did want him to be honest with me but he could have been honest without being so vile about it. I mentioned that I needed support and care right now because I am at the lowest. I need him to be by my side. Though, he did agree throughout the entire process that even though he didn't support my decision, he supported me because he knew the degree would be worthless if i wasn't alive to use it. After a-lot of crying and explaining and repeating the fact that I need him to be empathic towards me right now, he finally apologized. It wasn't fake. It was genuine. I knew by the tone of his voice and he said he was sorry for throwing in his fears right now when all I needed was for him to support me and for putting me through hell on top of my initial stress. &#x200B; My problem is I don't know if I can move forward in this relationship. We have been together for almost 2 years but after these past three days, I feel like the love was sucked out of me. We shared the same dreams about everything in our future. We did everything together. But now i feel like I'm in fear that he's going to belittle me at the next failure I experience. It feels like he's my enemy rather than my friend. I don't know why I have to scream and yell and cry to ask for some compassion. It feels like tough love but I'm just not even feeling the ""love"" portion. I just feel broken. I deserve more than this because I didn't something horrible. I made a decision to make myself happy in the long run and to have him talk about me ruining his financial future makes me feel like i'm not good enough. I have this urge to break up with him. I feel like he showed me who he is at my lowest. I just don't know how to live a life without him. I'm not sure if I should give him another chance. Should I cut ties or give him another chance? Please give me some advice. Thank you!!",

Like trying to go about your daily routine while a repairman is over, except with a repairman whom you just unsuccessfully tried to kill.) I'm curious if anyone has had success porting Fight or Fly over to SSE. I'm even more curious to know if someone has made something similar, with improvements or with the benefit of lessons learned from Fight or Fly. I recall that FoF had some bugs and weird behavior; kuertee had posted that he was planning on rebuilding it, but I don't think he ever did. And it left some room for expansion (imagine a battle cry power that would influence the flight odds, or involve an intimidation check).",
462,"Mother makes her daughter suicidal because daughter is sick of being a parent to her sistersSo I've known this Karen (obv not her real name) my whole life. She's the type of person that complains about maxing out her credit cards and 3 days later books a holiday. She is also always bragging about how perfect her children are, even though her eldist raised them almost by herself. People involved in this are Karen (em), her oldest daughter (d), Karen's brother (u) and her daughter's boyfriend (bf). From the age of about 6, em made d look after her little sisters because em was always too busy with charity work. Me and all of the other friends d had, have always told her that she shouldn't put up with it but she knew that if she didn't cook for her sisters, they'd eat cereal for dinner. I also suspect that she didn't think she deserved a social life because she'd been raised just to be a free babysitter (even when em was home). She got her bf about 4 months before things started kicking off. D started to stand up for herself. She didn't want to have to mother her siblings anymore. Em started flipping out. D constantly had her phone taken off her and was never allowed out of the house. That was when em looked through the messages on d's phone. There was a conversation between her and a friend, where the friend offered her drugs but she refused. She also installed a tracker on d's phone so she always knew her location. D was in mcdonalds, when she had lessons scheduled, but instead of talking to about it, she screamed and shouted about how both were bf's fault. U spoke to her teachers and they said that they'd let her leave because she finished her work early. After that, everytime d left the house, em sent her threatening and berating messages about how ""useless"" she is. Em refused to even look at her when she was in the house. D became very depressed. She was actively planning her suicide while refusing to leave her room or even talk to anyone. U found out about this. He spent a whole day just getting her out of the house and into his car. She took only the essentials with her. U gave her a room in his house but it still took over a month to get her to open up about everything. Em still insists that bf is one of the worst people on the planet. He's probably the sweetest guy in the world. D wasn't going to have an 18th party (because u couldn't afford it) so he told his parents to use the money for his party on her instead. I think the worst part is that em turned up at u's house on d's 18th birthday to give d a car and hope that she'd just forgotten what had happened. D just took the keys, mumbled a ""thanks"" and went back to her room. D and bf have been together for over a year now and are saving to buy an apartment together. She has nothing to do with em anymore and still texts her sisters regularly. TL;DR: Mother makes her daughter suicidal because she's too lazy to actually be a parent. Then she thinks a car will fix everything. Edit: thank you kind stranger, for the silver! Edit 2: omg a gold too! Guys I'm actually going to cry. Thank you!!!",

465,"Mass importing immigrants is culturally suicidal, morally bankrupt, and should be resisted.Cultures exist because of similarity between people, who then develop tribal traditions and customs. They dress the same, speak with the same accents, develop the same games and pass times. Multiculturalism seeks to improve the pool of genetics in a given state by maximising variety of mates, but increasing that variety is done at the expense of culture, which is destroyed entirely by the introduction of alien beliefs and customs. Suddenly you have to accomodate more beliefs and requirements, which doesn't create a stronger community, it stretches its cohesion to breaking point. This is why big cities develop ghettos - because different cultures can't blend properly, and often don't want to. They resist blending, antagonistically, refusing to share a common language, religion or even clothing. Every conquering nation has acted in the, same manner, and it should not be tolerated. The British did it in America before killing off the locals, the South African colonies, the Spanish in South America, and the colonies in Australia all acted the same way, as feeble immigrants who needed help and tolerance from the locals to survive, but later grew strong enough to take over. No country should let such an insideous thing happen to it. Its flawed morality which makes us do this to ourselves. Nietzsche foresaw it when he pointed out ""Christian slave morality"" - and how we seem to believe that allowing the weak to overcome us and take our place is somehow virtuous and righteous, when any rational thinker can see that its bloody suicidal. Race is not a consideration in this argument, but one can certainly look to protect one's own racial autonomy without hatred or a sense of superiority over another race. I love all the races and celebrate the differences between them. But I wouldn't want them all to be blended into one beige soup. Thats not how we evolved. We are all specialised and should overlap sparingly but without prejudice.",
466,"After 10 years of ineffective self-improvement, 3 years of being suicidal, and only days before I was planning on killing myself, I have finally managed to get a girl to go on a second date with me.From a very young age, I could always tell that I had an unattractive face, but kept myself sane and hopeful by listening to all the platitudes society shoved down my throat, like I'm sure many of you have. For others, the most important thing in life is family, or friends, or money, or status; for me, it is romantic love. So for 13-year old me, those two facts led to a decade of attempting to improve myself to one day become attractive to someone. I forced myself to become more social, worked on my style, hygiene, started playing basketball seriously, working out, picking up guitar and other hobbies, buying status symbols in clothes, accessories, electronics, cars. I even managed to join a fraternity in college. It was only in my 2nd year of college, after seeing all my friends, fraternity brothers, and classmates hooking up & dating while I was as much of a romantic failure as ever, did I realize all that was bullshit. I realized that no matter how good of a partner you may be on the inside, it all was for nought if you had an unattractive face, even if you have a good body like I do. Cue a very long 3-4 years of being suicidally depressed, intimately deprived, and hopeless. I had a few first dates, maybe once per year, but I was always rejected when asking for a second date. Each rejection weighed on me more and more, and eventually I lost what tiny sliver of hope I had. A few months ago began probably my worst depressive episode. I had planned to kill myself sometime mid-January, and had gathered all the supplies I needed to do it. Literally days before I planned to kill myself, I matched with a really cute girl on Tinder and we hit it off. Two weeks later, we went on our first date and it was easily the best date I've ever been on. I've learned a lot about her and I genuinely really like her. At the end of the date, I kissed her goodbye and asked her out for a 2nd date this weekend, which she enthusiastically agreed to. She even came up with an idea and a plan, which pleasantly shocked me. It feels as if a miracle has happened to me. For the first time in a long while, I have feelings of hope and excitement for the future. I'm still wary because I've gotten my hopes up only to be sorely disappointed in the past, and if this doesn't work out I will certainly end my life. But nonetheless, I can see a light at the end of the tunnel. I hope all of you find similar miracles in your lives. EDIT: Thank you all for the kind words. The second date went even better than the first and I am in the happiest mood I have been in years. I think this might finally be it.",

473,"CMV: If ""My body, my choice"" applies to abortion, then it applies to physician-assisted suicide as wellThe whole idea supporting abortion is that it's the women's right to choose what happens to/with her body. If you're able to kill another living thing with a heartbeat via a medical procedure for whatever reason, then that should apply to assisted suicide as well. I can also argue that it fits the ""My body, my choice"" mantra even more than abortion because there is no other (potential) person/life involved. The other argument is: if abortion is illegal, they'll do it under the table anyway and potentially risk infection or even their lives in a ""back alley"" abortion. Why doesn't the same apply for suicide? If someone wants to end his/her life and it's not allowed in a controlled medical procedure, they're going to do it under the table. As you may know, a lot of suicides end in failure, resulting in permanent brain damage, disability, and/or disfigurement.

489,"Did I really watch someone just get shadow banned from the discord for...being suicidal?I'm confused, I was talking to this user for a while and she was pretty on the edge about being suicidal. She was talking to one of the admins in support 3, then ends up banned? She's told me she didn't get a warning, didn't get a message from the bot, and the friends she had in staff have removed her from their friends list. I'm a bit confused like...Did this chick seriously just get banned from your community / server for utilizing services that YOU provide? EDIT: So now that I've got an understanding... 1 ) She wasn't ""shadow banned"" she was banned for being deemed ""colorful"" and to much to handle. I will elaborate more in point 3, but essentially her discussion in the Support channel was deemed as ""attention seeking"" and ""guilt tripping"". 2 ) Her past in two servers where she was sexually harassed and bullied / stalked was somehow bought into question despite upon her first day of joining and being recognized by a stalked she was told by ""zorro"" that they were NOT aware of this nor keeping ""intel"" like this. They basically lied and admitted to her they do have information on her that they refused to disclose. This is illegal. 3 ) A User, by the name Kippy or Klippy? Something like that, she described his profile picture to me and I remember seeing his name around. Had DM'd her, asked for a specific picture, then sent it to staff complaining about her DM'ing him a ""concerning image"" (A gun she had referenced owning) and attempting to guilt trip and ""seek attention"" from him. This was not the case, for whatever reason this user decided to completely bait her into posting an image in DM then using it against her. This same user also was present when she was kicked for 24 hours by responding to a comment made by him. She now believes this user is part of the Two servers / small circle of people who have previously harassed her online. 4 ) This is absolutely horrible, the response from staff basically circle jerking with ""We aren't professionals."" and ""We gave her links."" isn't relevant at all. You market yourselves proudly as a mental health server that fights depression, but when someone on the verge of losing their battle comes to you on their knees you openly go out of your ways to just toss them aside and label them as ""colorful"" and ""problematic"" based off an issue in which they (the user in question here) had to get the police involved due to potential doxxing. When she came to GFD and was told / discovered one of these people was IN the server, she was muted, belittled, and told by Zorro and other staff that they ""couldn't do anything"" and that ""no one had given them information about her."" This was a flat out lie. I'm without a doubt leaving this community and going to attempt to get whoever hands out Discord Partnerships to look into this...this is absolutely NOT how a discord partnered server should be operating. EDIT #2 I'd like to add a Point #5 5 ) You are taking someone who you KNOW / KNEW works with children and twisting them into being some violent behavioral concern for people. This is extremely dangerous knowing that someone on your server is part of a group of people in mental health servers who have doxxed her before. You have literally just given these people material that could absolutely impact her ability to work and find work. This is just another point about how dangerously careless you've handled this situation...allowing people who she warned you about to manipulate her post and intentions into this weird sociopolitical violent personality is insane, like legitimately dangerous and I hope you realize this and make some sort of statement to how fucking reckless you handled this. Last Edit : You people are fucking psychopaths...This entire situation contradicts the purpose of your server...suicidal woman talking to zorro (admin) for help, you claim she was guilt tripping people in DM when from the screenshots I was shown by her, the guy DM'd her first ASKING bait tier questions? All of this happens AFTER She warns you someone in the server is part of a group of people who used to doxx her and she had previously filed a police report again? You just compromised someone's physical and mental safety in favor of putting your meaningless fucking server rules first. You had her Discord disabled, her email made public to her abusers, and her access to mental health support groups revoked. You're like...actually shitty people, every single one of you mods who sat on their high horse telling her ""Oh the Rules though! The Rules, the Rules, the rules!"" I legitimately don't know what to say other than you're actually psychopaths who are playing dangerous games with actually mental ill people who you claim to be here for when you're not.",

493,“Suicidal” PlayerSo I made a DnD club (with the help of some friends) and we have about 20 members. I decided to split everyone up into groups of about 5 each since there were semi-experienced DMs. I was in a group with 2 friends 1 of which was the DM. Now the “suicidal” player (SP) was fine the first 2 weeks and his friend (F) was basically carrying the whole party. The problems started with him disagreeing with a few things the DM was doing. He argued about allowing the dragonborn use breathweapon multiple times a day without rest and said he was going easy on us.(Our dragonborn was my friend who has never played before) And in our discord SP was insulting everyone and complaining about breaking the rules. Instead of having SP leave I gave him another chance. He was fine for another 2 sessions and then he started becoming a problem. In 1 session he refused to speak at all ( No explanation was given as to why) At the next session he would make actions that would make things harder for the party and make a few comments here and there. In discord SP would make talk by saying things like how he was suicidal and depressed( I have been there so i tried to help) but a week later SP starts going off saying F didnt care about child abuse. I learn from F that he was saying his parents abused him and that he had taken her advice as “So youre siding with my parents!?” and screaming rude comments ( trust me when i say F said nothing of the sort) And here is where the “suicidal” part comes. SP sent a video to F of him drinking “Bleach” saying “ It’s your fault” but ofc it was a fake video and a friend of F reported it to the office and SP got suspended for 2-1 weeks. Surprisingly SP just got super sulky and quit the club. The gameplay was fine when he didn’t act out but the overall experience was ruined for everyone.,
494,"JNMIL decided she was suicidal and apparently it's our faultI'm could really use some validation, advice, support, whatever right now please. Anything at all would be helpful because I'm so frustrated and mad and upset. Please read my post history for background info. SO and I have been NC with his parents since December. It was the right decision and neither of us regret it. A few days ago he gets a text from GMIL saying that MIL is back in the hospital. She does not provide any details so we assume it is related to the recent routine medical procedure she had preformed. MIL likes attention and complaining about her health stuff so it's not that surprising she found a reason to go back to the hospital. I probably sound uncaring here but that is her M.O. We are not going to break NC just because she is trying to lay on a guilt trip. MIL has already sent him a text which he ignored and also a card which he returned. A day or so after getting the text he gets a voicemail from another family member who says that it's been a while since she has seen us and wants to see how we are doing etc. He doesn't get around to calling her back for a few days. For the record this family member has always been a JY so we weren't sure if she was being a FM or what. We have not told anyone in his family why we went NC with inlaws because obviously it's not their business and we don't want to be put in the position of having to defend our decision. When SO calls this family member back she tells us that MIL is in hospital because she is suicidal and it's because we aren't talking to her and are not letting her see her grandkids. So yeah...that was unexpected. I have read other people's posts about JN family members doing this but didn't think that it would happen to I us I guess? Honestly I'm really mad at MIL for pulling this crap. Call me heartless if you want to idc at this particular moment in time. Like seriously after everything that SO has dealt with she decides that instead of trying to change her behavior she just ups the ante? Go fuck yourself MIL. I actually have depression, anxiety, and ptsd so I'm not unsympathetic to mental health struggles. But you want to know what I am unsympathetic to? I am very unsympathetic to bullshit. I am also unsympathetic to people crying wolf because they didn't get their way. Sorry I know I'm raging right now but I am just so mad. Ok back to the phone call, I can tell that SO's family member is trying to be kind and probably just wants everyone in the family to be happy and get along and all that. She makes sure to tell him that she isn't trying to tell him what to do, that she knows he has his own reasons for not talking to inlaws, that everyone loves us and isn't upset with us. That she knows MIL can be dramatic and often wants attention. But then she goes on to say that this has been really hard on MIL and faaaaaamily is so important and his parents love him and could he see it in his heart to get in touch with MIL? MIL is just ever so heartbroken at the idea of not getting to see us or the grandkids any more. She was so depressed before the grandkids came along and they gave her something to look forward to. Could we maybe just bring them over to see inlaws sometimes? Like not for a whole weekend or anything but maybe an hour or so? Maybe SO and I could let them watch the kids when we go out on a date? She says that she loves us and just wants to help however she can. SO listens to her whole thing, says that we miss her too and that he is not trying to distance himself from her then politely ends the phone call. I have such mixed feeling about the call. I really do like this family member and I want to believe in my heart that she is only trying to be helpful. I don't want to be mad at her. I keep thinking that maybe if I were in her shoes I would try to mend the rift in my family too? I guess you could say I'm disappointed though. She never mentioned MIL taking responsibility for her actions or behavior, or saying that she was sorry about anything. It doesn't sound like MIL is sorry for anyone but herself. Like what the hell are we supposed to do here? SO is adamant (thank god) that he doesn't want to break NC. I guess it just bothers me that we are looking like the bad guys in this situation. Idk why I care about what his family thinks. I still like many of them and want them to be a part of our lives. It would mean the world to SO to maintain those relationships. I know he worries about having to cut off his entire family. I'm sure MIL is making us sound horrible, oh boohoo poor me I'm in the hospital for being suicidal and my own son won't even talk to me. What if people hate us? It probably shouldn't matter but I guess it does because I'm sitting here worrying about it. I have no idea how I'm going to get any sleep tonight. Thank to anyone who reads this. Edited to add: Family member who SO called back said that she hoped our children did not one day resent us for keeping them from their grandparents. Whether or not she felt this was helpful to say I think it was very uncalled for. My first thought was don't you dare try and tell me who our children should be around. MIL is emotionally abusive, manipulative, lies constantly, disrespects boundaries and rules that SO puts in place, and tries to pretend she is their parent. FIL also lies, disrespects boundaries, and has been creepy and inappropriate towards me and other women. At one point he asked me if I wanted to go on a monthly date with him. They are not people who should be around ANY children especially my own.",
496,"The AI is suicidalSo I was on one of those flashpoint missions where you have to provide support to an allied lance and help them escape the field. Apparently there is a trigger that will cause them to ""make their escape"" when they think the OpFor is weak enough. Anyway, I am in Martian terrain that is mostly flat with a few dust storms here and there. The mission is going very well; we are turning the OpFor (two full lances of heavies) into a smoldering junkpile, but have only finished off about half of the mechs. The allied lance says they are going to begin their extraction, so they make a dead sprint for the extraction point...right on the other side of the remaining 3-4 enemy mechs. They just sprint right through them, not even caring about exposing their backs or taking gift shots. Fortunately the remaining mechs had already been softened up by my artillery and ballistics, and I was able to charge in my Battlemaster to pull their attention away. But that definitely could have gone worse. Had another one once on an urban map, where they charged right at an opposing Atlas. I was able to take it out, but the Atlas got a lucky AC headshot on my King Crab and sent the pilot to the memorial wall.

So I decided to create a new account because I’ve heard that my mothers FM are thinking about using Reddit. While I don’t know for sure if that’s true I just need to be careful because my son and mines position is so precarious right now. I’ve posted some on here before with my other account but now I need to start working on purging all this from my head. Also, I apologize every time because I’m always on mobil. Also I’ve not had it anywhere close to as bad as most people here, I just need somewhere that someone will understand without the “you’re crazy” looks or immediately defending that it couldn’t/can’t be that bad. I’m not a witty writer as much as I wish I was, and there’s not a lot of stories that aren’t just depressing I spent so much time the last few days reading so many different people’s experiences that I finally have the strength to take some of the things that are locked inside me so hard and finally talk about them. I’m gonna borrow a comment from u/Libida that I came across, “gods I’m surrounded by justno’s.” I have an Nmom, Nbrother, Nsister-in-law, Nniece 1, Nnephew 1, Ndaughter and two Nex’s. But by Danu did I have a blingy Yes daddy, MGF (maternal grandfather), and MGM (maternal grandmother). All the things I need to get out has all these people at some point in time staring right along with my mother because she couldn’t be a justno to me all by herself.. I have a couple that o need to get off my chest tonight or I’ll never get any sleep. So we’re gonna start aaaaaaalllllllllllllll the way back in that era of ghastly clothes but some damn good music known as the first part of the 80’s when I was born. As the story I’ve been told all my life that for the first time in 200 years I was the only person in my entire family that wasn’t born in Alabama, Mississippi or Tennessee. Can we say I was the SG black sheep of 98% of my family??? So my parents and brother were living in a smaaaaaalllllllllllll town in the northern part of Arizona, but the closest hospital was across the border in California. Now mother goes into labor and they rush off to the next state for me to be born. Now this is the only time i know of that daddy didn’t have that titanium shine with mother. Instead of leaving bro with someone from daddy’s church that they had made arrangements with he was in the room when I was born because mother just HAD to have her baby boy with her. Now he was 7 when I was born. Well I’m born and we’re discharged the next day. Well I should note that bro also had the flu, daddy told him point blank not to get close till he was better. Weeeeelllllllllll a day or two later daddy had to go to the church to take care of something and bro decided he wanted to hold me. My mother, the RN, let my flu ridden bro hold me and I wasn’t even 5 days old. Can anyone guess what happened???? Late that night they were in the emergency room with me because I was running a 103 fever. I ended up in the NICU where it was also discovered I’m allergic to iodine. (Because of course I am). I spent two weeks in the NICU, mother left after they had me admitted and didn’t come back till I was discharged. That was the first time my bro tried to kill me, and I’ve spent the last 30 plus years getting to hear how it’s just sooooooooo funny from mother and bro, who were of course only saying that part when daddy wasn’t around. Here’s a little bonus that I enjoy getting to point out to people when I can. I mentioned where my family was from, well I don’t know if it’s my “backwards thinking” or because I was raised in the deserts of Arizona, but I don’t hold the same beliefs as my family. Now mother and bro pride themselves on being good Christian southern Baptist and they accept everyone for who they are (my eyes can’t go back any further). But wait what happens when some one whose not “gods people” comes close to them????? I love watching that CBF going on because they don’t wanna give up their (good Christian image.”",
507,Rewatching season one...So I was rewatching season one today and Sam is strangling Annalise and she is saying come on kill me please. So what if the finale season was to play out as Sam killed Annalise? Would Wes still end up dead? Would Conner and Oliver still get married? Would Laurel still get pregnant and have Christopher? Idk I just found it curious when I was watching.,
508,"Season's 2 editingLove the show but the editing this season has really bothered me. I loved Andrea Arnold's work on Transparent, so this isn't a dig on the director, but this season has rather been strange to watch. First few episodes were fine, but the editing got so choppy recently and last episode's ending montage was the epitome of it. Tonally it came out of nowhere, there was no momentum to that big Corey reveal, it was quick cutaways between huge, suspenseful scenes and other fluffy moments but it had no weight emotionally for me. The confusion about ""do we know that character?"" didn't help either. Look, the flashbacks and visions scenes are pretty uninspired, but I was fine with that because Jean-Marc Vallée is just that good and not easy to recreate, and having a montage practically at the end of each episode is .... whatever, but Kill Me ending montage just ruined what should have been a huge moment, and given how there are only 2 episodes left, the show just can't afford it. Another weird thing is the fact there are like 10 people credited for editing and it's a little strange. I don't know whether it's BTS drama but it feels like one of those Fox reedited movies, I don't know. I'm just really frustrated and bummed out. This show was so fun to watch, but this season I found myself just going through the motions. Now I do believe the script isn't helping either, but the editing (with the cast and acting) is what made this show more than a soapy drama, and losing that level of quality in editing is having more repercussions than I expected. EDIT: Typo on the title, apologies. New phone and still getting used to the keyboard.",

529,"Travis Gafford doesn't know how to interview (don't kill me)Travis Gafford has done a lot for the scene; nobody would deny that. He has immense presence in the LCS, LES, and any league necessary for him to conduct an interview. Everything he does sheds light on the scene and gives us outsiders insight we could never dream of getting, if not for him. I respect that. I respect him. I am grateful for everything he does. With that said...I watched the interview with him and Parth shedding light on TSM's current situation. I encourage you to watch it too if you don't like my title. What does he contribute to the interview? He asks a question, (preprepared, scripted, no doubt) and then he sits there for several minutes until the question is answered. He doesn't move. He doesn't react. Worst of all, he doesn't even acknowledge anything Parth says as he moves into the next question. ""Your team didn't do so well last year compared to TSM standards. What do you think about next year's team?' ""Well, I think we've built a stronger team and am confident in next year's results."" ""That's great you have confidence in next year's lineup. What do you think about how this team can transition into ""xyz"" compared to last year?"" That's just an example. How hard is it to say one sentence relating what your interviewee had answered you and tie it into your next question? It's not. In this interview Travis looked checked out and didn't offer any thought into the interview. It was as if he was on autopilot and just reading off a script until he ran out of bullet points. He just asks the next thing as if Parth hadn't spoken at all. This is interviewing 101. This is speaking 101. If you want your audience, or cospeaker, to feel engaged you need to acknowledge that you are at least listening to what they say. This is not prevalent in his interviews. He asks his, no doubt scripted, question and then when they finally stop talking he asks the next question. Then he sits there and waits for them to shut up again so he can ask the next question. This is not an ""interview."" This is an info dump. You might as well let Parth (or whomever) monologue about whatever talking points they want to cover for however long and then stop it and throw it on your channel. This isn't journalism. This isn't ""reporting."" This is a priveleged person who gets to know things nobody else could know, revealing it to the public. Fine. Reveal it. Let them say whatever they want. Throw it on your channel. Monotize it. I don't care. Just don't pretend it's an interview. You're sitting there, waiting for them to stop talking, not even acknowledging their responses, and then blitzing out another question. Don't pretend that's an interview. Or journalism. Call it for what is. Thanks for coming to my TED complaining session.",

546,"A guy from a party tried to kill me and I thought it was a teachable moment.I'll try to make a long story short, I was doing a guy I barely know a favor, but when I told him I was giving his car keys to his parents because I didnt trust him with them, he snapped. He grabbed a fire extinguisher from his car and said ""I didnt want to have to do this, you made me"" He had already said he would ""slit my throat"" ""make sure you're going to die tonight"" multiple times prior, so when he grabbed a fire extinguisher I started to take him seriously. Guy was being quite the jerk all night and there was a girl I just met and another drunken friend who was very scared looking on. I grappled him, he tried to bite off my ear and my chest through my jacket, he tried to gouge my eyes leaving scratches and bleeding on my face. I held him in a pin and told him ""I'm your friend and I'm going to do everything I can to keep you safe tonight"" Eventually he was arrested for a DUI after escaping his parents house where I had left him, but I felt I did everything I could to help. Now my one friend stayed quiet but the girl was angry with me. She wanted me to hurt him, she didnt talk to me again after that and she was completely sober. I tried to explain that I didnt believe in fighting but it was an awkward ride home (she elected to drive me home so I could drive the guy home in his car, we are nice people). Quick flex I'm 240 pounds, at one time the best highschool wrestler in the country, I do MMA and in the top 1% for fitness. I heard a quote today ""those who have weapons and keep them sheathed shall inherit the earth"" That really resonated with me. Maybe I'm wrong. Everyone has their own opinions. *edit* While the quick flex was definitely a brag, It is an important detail. If I was an average guy, I don't know who I'd be or how I'd react. But I've always been bigger and athletic. Psychologically speaking I might be a very different person if I grew up otherwise. I never thought about it until recently someone pointed out that it was the reason I'm never scared in situations like that. Maybe that's true, but I dont know.",
547,"Made the discovery that breakfast absolutely KILLS ME.I’ve only been back on the wagon for about a week, but have been determined that this time it’s going to stick. I’m 32 years old, enough is enough, I don’t have the luxury of deciding to fall off the wagon haha So, in an effort to really do things right, for the last week I’ve been starting the day with a serving of oatmeal, about 110 calories plus a splash of milk. I figured this is a nice healthy grain that would stick to my ribs. Unrelated (or so I thought), I’ve been MISERABLE since day 1- just constantly thinking, dreaming, craving more food. I’ve come in at or under my calories every day, but it was rough. Day before yesterday, I decided to double my oatmeal consumption (2 servings at 220 calories total) in hopes that it would help with my insane hunger. It was a huge bowl and super satisfying in the moment, but the rest of that day was the absolute worst one of the whole run. I was at work and wasn’t able to DO anything because my mind was so hyper focused on needing more food. I was starving and miserable and going insane. I figured, this is weight loss in your 30’s, deal with it. Yesterday, I was running late so brought my packet of oatmeal with me to work with the intent of scarfing it down upon arrival. Of course, I got busy and just...forgot. And then lunch time rolls around, so I eat my lunch. And the rest of the day was SO PLEASANT. I wasn’t thinking about food at all. I wasn’t hungry at all. I just...was. By the end of the day, I came in under my goal by about 200 calories. And when I went into the freezer to get ice for my ice water, and saw the thin mints sitting there, I considered having a couple because I had the calories...but then went “meh, I’m not really in the mood for them. I’d rather just have my ice water”. And then I closed the freezer and didn’t think about those thin mints again- which never happens with me. Today, I skipped breakfast again just to make sure yesterday wasn’t a weird fluke. And so far, so good. Everyone always says breakfast is the most important meal of the day. I bought into that hard. Screw breakfast.",

569,"My JNML hates me and would kill me if she had her wayEdit: TW- DEATH THREATS/PHYSICAL AND MENTAL ABUSE First, this is an obvious throwaway and I'm on mobile so forgive the formatting. You may have even read this story if you've browsed r/borrow (Note: I'm not posting here for any help, just to vent to people who understand crazy JNMILs.) Heads up, it's gonna be a long one. Due to financial difficulties and my FILs death, my family of four had to move in with MIL a few months ago. If there had been an alternative, I damn sure would have taken it. She had hated me since the day I married her baby boy and only son sixteen years ago. She said that was the single worst day of her life. The day we got married she got so mad at my months over centerpieces that she shoved her into a grandfather clock and broke three of my mother's ribs. Since we've been here, it's not stop fighting. Like, she hits and shoves me and tells me I'm a liar, thief, whore, bitch, gutter trash, etc. The four of is share one small room and she takes half of my husband's small check each payday (week) for rent, amounting to $600 a month. I have a promising full time job hopefully that I'll have an answer on this week. Right now I'm a substitute preschool teacher and rarely do they need to call me in. Most of my husband's check goes to health insurance for the four of us. She won't allow lights on and my son does his homework by the light of his tv monitor. I do all the cleaning, all the dishes, and decluttered her house because it was nasty when we moved in. I've pressure washed the house, privacy fence, walk way, and do the landscaping. I wash all the towels. I keep every room except the bedrooms we aren't in clean without ever having been asked to do so. I'm always doing nice little things for her trying to win a tiny bit of affection and see least avoid her absolutely crazy screaming at me for that day. There's truly something mentally wrong with her but she's never honest with her doctor. She's been ten times worse since the beginning of the year. She tells me she hates he and now knows why my mother didn't want me. My husband says if I stop responding to her and let her just get it out of her system, then it wouldn't get so bad. But I feel like I need to defend myself when she says these awful things. Thursday, she got mad at me for something or another and started shoving me and hitting me. Then she told me she'd kill me (not the first time), and this time actually went to the knife drawer but thankfully it was empty. Until then, I haven't reported her to law enforcement because she tells me she'll just put on an ""I'm just a 74 year old elderly woman, how could I possibly be strong enough to hurt anyone, I'm so feeble and sugary sweet!"" My husband, when he's not working full time and is home to witness this, says to keep my mouth shut so it'll deescalate tells us both to stop. I wish he'd stand to to her more but it would cause her to kick us all out in the street and he is just trying to make it to our tax return so we can move the hell out and never come back. The next day, she shoved me into a counter and i hit it at the small of my back, where I already have pain due to medical issues. Then she stressed threatening to kill me again, and hitting me. I'd had it. I had recorded audio of some arguments and threats and was going to use them if ever needed. Yesterday in finally called the police and they took statements from us all. I went to get my phone to let them listen to the recordings but she'd b his it under the stairs and it was hours before I finally found it. The police in our area are a joke. They just gave me victim's rights brochures, listened to her little old lady act, didn't arrest her due to ""conflicting statements"", and said they're file a report. Ohhhh.... Now she's pissed. She filed anb eviction notice for just me, not my family. I have thirty days and no money, no where to go. She won't allow me to wash or dry even my kids school clothes. She told me I better not take one bite of any food she had or makes. This was a jab because I'm anorexic. She made dinner last night and told me to tell the kids they had food in the kitchen. I don't have any friends around so I don't have anyone to ask about staying with and my family isn't nearby. With no extra money, no way to get a loan, all the public assistance on backlog, I'm screwed. She's the just awful hateful person I've ever met. She told me I finally crossed the line by calling the police. We usually get out refund around March so at least then we can all get a place together away from her. my kids are being mentally affected because they can hear the screaming through the walls. My little girl is heartbroken because Mommy won't be here to keep MIL from picking on her (she doesn't like my daughter and does plenty for my son), and she can't go to sleep without me. I didn't tell hey I'm just as sad, too. And MIL tells me God is going to strike me down for being so awful to HER. So, that's my JNMIL contribution. I've been reading y'all's and I'm really sorry for all you guys go through too. It's an awful club to belong to.",
570,"My Ndad May Be Planning to Kill Me TomorrowI don't know if this sounds paranoid, but I think that my Ndad may try to murder me some time soon - possibly as early as tomorrow. My mother died in a ""mysterious house fire of unknown cause"" just months after she was granted with the majority of custody of my brothers and I. Until last year no one had done anything else to hinder my father's control. He cheated my grandfather out of money by telling him that he needed it for rent or for his kids when he already had a well paying job, and stole tens of thousands of dollars from my brother's and my inheritance from my mother. Last year he tried to do it a second time, I didn't allow him too. Instead I told the executor of the account what happened, and now my father has no trust from that side of the family, or any way of taking the money. I didn't talk to him for almost a year, and when I did, I was met with manipulation and threats. The first threat was on the phone. He told me that he had blocked my messages to him ""for my own safety."" I originally rolled my eyes at that, but he's only gotten worse. When I asked him if we could discuss having some sort of an amiable relationship over Christmas, originally he sent me a text basically disowning me and how he was disgusted after my ""episode from last year"" ... of which I replied to him not to gaslight me and that the only ""episode"" was him trying steal from me again. Then suddenly out of no where he became almost sickly sweet in response and wanted to meet me in the new year. We had a video chat with the family over Christmas and he acted like nothing had ever happened and that everything was all right --- which was really out of character after the texts a week before. That was until he mentioned in an off moment when my brother's computer glitched that he has a rifle. I've never known him to have a gun in the house, and why the heck would he mention it when I was talking about how my dog is scared of nerf guns? (We were talking about animals - not guns in particular.) I decided to meet him tomorrow at a public restaurant, but something about his wording is really screwing with me. He texted me about making a ""final choice"" about our relationship. I'm only 31, so there should be nothing ""final"" about it. It's a long life, right? I'm really worried that if I don't submit to his controlling tactics that he's going to kill me and his unborn grandchild. Maybe my house will be burnt mysteriously too - or even worse, he may shoot me. Am I paranoid? My fiance told me that he's going to wait for me in the restaurant parking lot for safety... I'm worried that my dad may be waiting there too with a rifle and has not intention of talking to me at all. Update: Thank you everyone for your comments and concern. I haven't replied to them because I'm having a moral dilemma about whether to go or not (the meeting is at 4:30pm pst). So many of you don't want me to go, but for the sake of fixing a huge rift in my family, I still feel like I should. It's not only for me. It's for my brothers, my aunt, and my grandfather so we can all go about life as usual again without 'an elephant in the room'. I really do think that I'm just being paranoid and that my father is just being a manipulative narcissist as usual. He uses threats and intimidation with everyone. It's just who he is. I'm not going to back down or let him gaslight when we do talk... and I think it's long past due that I stop being so scared. He's an old cripple with an inflated ego. That's all that I'm going to let him be to me. Note that I've also created a plan to stay safe - and making this reddit post was part of it, along with calling people and telling them the plan, as well as the precautions I'm taking in the plan itself. Again, I thank you all for your concern and I'll keep you updated with what happens. Update 2: The meeting is over and I'm safe. I got to the restaurant parking lot half an hour early in my fiance's work vehicle and made sure that my father entered the restaurant before I did. The meeting basically consisted of him denying that he stole anything, telling me that I don't need to know where any money went because ""his past with money is tragic,"" and then gaslighting that legal paperwork is meaningless (looool)... I tried to focus on feelings because getting him to tell the truth is like getting water to flow uphill. He told me that he was hurt because I called him names like ""thief"" when I first confronted him. Poor guy thinks that he's a victim. In the end we decided to be amiable, but I don't think that I'll be visiting him any time soon. He's still a narcissistic weirdo. In conclusion, we're going to set up a security system with motion censor cameras for the house. My father's demeanor was still far from friendly whenever small-talk wasn't being said. I don't want to take any chances with house fires. Thanks again for your concerns guys! It truly touches me that people really do care, even over the internet.",

604,"I Can't Fucking Die“Three weeks,” my doctor said, letting out a heavy sigh. “That’s on the low-end. We hope that you’ll get at least a month, if we get lucky. In the end, though, it’s just an estimate, really.” My girlfriend Rachel began to squeeze my hand harder, the other pressed against her face as she continued to sob silently. “And… and there’s *nothing* left for us to do?” I said, shifting nervously in my chair. “I’m sorry, Nicholas,” Dr. Harper said, a pained look in his eyes. “I can prescribe you with some pain medications, to help ease any pains you may feel in the coming weeks. Other than that, I’m afraid you’re out of options.” His words were harsh and to the point, but I was not offended. From day one, I’d told him that I appreciated the news given in its most basic form. I didn’t need him to sugarcoat the fact that I was dying. “Thanks,” I said, unsure of what I was really thanking him for. Lung cancer had been my own fault, I suppose. I’d first tried a cigarette when I was about eighteen, but I never realized that I was addicted until I was almost twenty-four. I tried to quit, *so* many times, but I would always come back for more. It was *my* fault, but that didn’t mean it didn’t fucking *suck.* Rachel stood, wiping at her eyes. I pushed myself up from my seat, beginning to cough violently. I’d started to cough a lot more recently, for much longer periods of time than I had at the start of this mess. My hand remained in Rachel’s as I covered my mouth with my inner arm, coughing. My throat stung, but I ignored the pain. I’d been getting good at that. As I looked back up, I found Dr. Harper staring back at me. “Rachel… would you mind leaving us alone for a minute?” he said, nodding towards my girlfriend. Rachel glanced at me, sniffling, before nodding and releasing my hand, stepping towards the doorway. I watched my girlfriend leave the room, my heart hurting. I’d accepted my fate long ago; I was more afraid for *her* future than I was my own. I looked back to Harper, clearing my throat. “What is it?” “I… I *lied* to you, Nicholas,” he said, sighing. I frowned, staring at my doctor. I had not been expecting this shift in tone. “What? What are you talking about…? I *am* dying, right?” “You have only three weeks to live, yes,” he said, sitting up in his chair. “But there *is* another option.” I nodded slowly, taking a seat. I was intrigued. “Really? Well, what is it?” “It… it is *highly* experimental,” Dr. Harper said, leaning forward in his chair. “I was approached a few days ago from those working down in the lab. They’re developing a new method of fighting cancer cells, even for those in later stages, like yourself.” I blinked. “Wow… that’s… crazy. How much would it cost me?” “Nothing at all,” Harper said. “As I said, it is new. It is… *dangerous.* There’s no telling what would happen to you if you consented. *But,* there *is* a chance that your cancer may be completely destroyed.” I shook my head slowly, trying to process what I was hearing. “This is insane… what happens if it doesn’t work?” Harper sighed, hesitating for a moment. “You’re in a unique situation, Nicholas. I only bring this up to you now because you have such a short time left.” I understood what he was refusing to say. “I get it. Let’s do it.” Dr. Harper frowned. “… you don’t want to hear more about the treatment?” “If it might keep me alive, then I’m in,” I said, standing back up. “I’ll be dead in a month anyways, right?” Harper nodded slowly, standing to see me out of the room. “I’ll be in touch shortly, Nicholas. We can administer the treatment whenever you’re ready - just not today, obviously.” “Does tomorrow work?” I asked, walking towards the door. Dr. Harper seemed even more surprised. “Well… yes, of course. I’ll make sure to let the lab know.” I thanked my doctor and left, feeling an odd sense of excitement. If this treatment worked, then I would get to *live.* I’d be able to get married to Rachel, have kids, grow old. If it *didn’t* work… then Rachel would just have to mourn my death a month sooner than we’d originally planned. At the time, I thought the choice was simple. The only thing holding me back from deciding was Rachel’s feelings, but even *then,* I knew I had to take this chance, this *miracle.* *God,* if only I knew what I was getting myself into. I didn’t tell Rachel about the treatment. Frankly, I had acted like an idiot back then. My mind was racing at the time; I was going to *live.* I acted without thinking. Had I considered what would happen if I’d died on the table that day? No, of course I hadn’t. How would Rachel have felt if I *left* her without even saying goodbye? As you can tell, that wasn’t what happened. Unfortunately. I met with Dr. Harper at the hospital the next morning, who took me down the employee elevator to the labs. “Are you sure you’re up for this?” Dr. Harper said, glancing towards me. “We can stop at any time.” “Really, I’m okay,” I said, nodding. “Alright,” Harper said, sighing. The elevator dinged as the doors slid open, revealing a bright white hallway. A nurse in blue scrubs stepped past us as we stepped out of the elevator. I couldn’t help but look around as I followed Harper through the bottom floor of the hospital. The workers here wore either white lab coats, or the blue scrubs I'd seen the woman wearing. It was extremely busy down here, more so than the rest of the hospital. Harper stopped beside a door, startling me. “Are you absolutely certain that you’re up for this, Nicholas?” I frowned, looking around. “What, are we doing this *right now?*” “Is there a problem with that?” he asked, moving his hand away from the door. I quickly shook my head. “No, no… I just thought there’d be a waiting period, you know? It's fine... I’m ready.” Harper nodded slowly, pushing open the door and stepping inside. I followed the man, looking around the room. It was no larger than a typical doctor’s office. A woman stood near the back of the room, reading through a stack of papers. A large silver briefcase sat on the counter beside her. The woman turned, smiling at Dr. Harper. “There you are, James. I was starting to think you weren't showing up.” Dr. Harper nodded, looking back at me. He gestured towards the patient’s bed, moving towards the back of the room. I stepped up to the bed, taking a seat on the edge of it. Dr. Harper spoke quietly with the woman for a few minutes as they scanned through the papers. What was this? I'd expected a much larger room; I imagined that I would have received a surgery that day. Harper nodded quickly to the woman, turning his attention back to me. “Alright, Nicholas, we’re about ready to start,” he said, moving towards the exit. I nodded, watching as he shut the door. I wanted to reply, but couldn’t find the words. The woman near the back of the room unclasped the lock on the briefcase, lifting open the lid. Harper sat in the chair across from the bed, staring at me. “This should only take about a minute, Nicholas. Are you certain that you're ready?” I nodded slowly, watching as the woman pulled a large syringe from the case. “Let’s… let’s just get this over with.” Harper nodded as the woman stepped up to me. I frowned as I took a closer look at the syringe. The glass tube within the syringe was filled with an odd blue liquid. It was hard to tell in the well-lit room, but it seemed as if it were *glowing.* I help up my arm, as if I thought the woman were about to jab me with the needle. “Whoa… what is this?” The woman took a step back as Harper stood, leaning against the foot of the bed. “It is your *treatment,* Nicholas. Once we inject you with the formula, it should immediately begin attacking the cancerous cells.” “How?” I asked, staring at the syringe. Maybe I *did* need to take this more seriously. “In short, the treatment *should* target your cancer and kill it. It will also attempt to make your body immune to any further instances of the disease,” he said, sighing. “We have plenty of time, Nicholas. Do you want to think about this?” I continued to stare at the needle, the blue liquid seeming almost to bubble within its container. “And… it’s safe?” I asked, realizing what I’d just asked. Harper sighed. “We cannot guarantee that, Nicholas. If any symptoms show up immediately, we *may* be able to stop it before anything serious happens. This is a risk you’re taking.” I nodded quickly, squinting my eyes shut. “Alright, alright. Do it.” Harper placed a hand on my shoulder. “Are you absolute-” “Just *do it,*” I said, nodding my head quickly. Harper didn’t respond, stepping back. My eyes remaining shut, I could feel a cold, wet sensation on my arm as the woman began to prepare the area. The waiting was killing me. Within the next sixty seconds, I could have been dead. I jumped slightly as I felt the prick of the needle against my arm. The nurse held me still, pushing against the bottom of the syringe. I couldn’t help but open my eyes. The blue liquid glowed beneath my skin as it coursed through my arm. I could see my veins through the skin, as if they’d been drawn on with glowing blue paint. I looked up at Dr. Harper with a mixture of fear and confusion. Harper gave me a polite smile. “Do you feel anything yet, Nicholas?” I shook my head, looking back at my arm. Glowing blue lines ran up to my shoulder. “No, I can’t. Nothing bad, I mean.” Harper nodded, stepping back to the counter. “That’s good. That’s a good sign.” I hummed softly, watching as the woman pulled the empty syringe from my arm. I twisted my arm around, inspecting it at every possible angle. It was a crazy sight to see. “The coloration should go away after a little while,” Harper said, grabbing my attention. “Likely within the next few hours, if not sooner.” I nodded, scoffing. “So, you’re saying I don’t have to look like an alien for the rest of my life?” Harper laughed. “I’m going to leave you with Nancy,” he said, flicking his head towards the nurse. “You can leave when she tells you that you can. I'd ask you to come in tomorrow, if possible. We want to run some follow up tests.” I nodded, confused. “Are you saying the cancer might be gone *tomorrow?*” “It’s entirely possible,” he said, stepping up to the door. “We frankly don’t know how the treatment works within the human body itself yet. The fact that you’re speaking right now is a good sign, Nicholas, so please don’t worry too much about it.” I couldn’t help but smile as Dr. Harper left the room. I spoke with the nurse for a little while, a new breath of life filling me. It was as if I could already feel the treatment working. Once Nancy released me, I stayed out of the house for a while, driving around town instead. I didn’t want Rachel to see the blue liquid in my arms. I didn’t want her to know until it *worked.* Rachel was a bit annoyed that I’d left without telling her that morning, especially after the news we’d heard the day before, but she didn’t stay angry for long. We chatted for a long time about our future - *her* future – and she spent some time crying. I wanted desperately to tell her about the treatment, then, but I knew it would only get her hopes up. We ate our favorite meal that night – the local Chinese place, who knew us by our first names. We watched a few episodes of our new favorite T.V. show. We… we made love. I tell you all of this because it is important. Important to *me.* It was the last day of my life that I was truly *happy.* The next morning, I returned to the hospital. A smile was plastered across my face. That morning, I had had more energy than I ever remembered having. I moved with ease; my body didn’t hurt anymore. I hadn’t coughed in hours. The treatment *had* to have worked. Dr. Harper met me in the waiting room. “It’s great to see you again, Nicholas,” he said, shaking my hand. “How are you feeling?” I smiled even wider. “I feel great. Really, I do. I think… I think it worked.” Harper smiled, gesturing for me to follow him. “Well, we need to make sure that it *did* work, Nicholas. What you’re feeling may just be coincidental.” I nodded, his words slightly dampening my joy. The two of us went down to the labs once more. Nancy was back; I had a nice conversation with her as she ran her tests, eventually taking them back over the lab. Harper told me that the tests could take a while, up to an hour if need be. I was okay with that; I had no other plans for today. After all, I was about to have another sixty years added to my life. I sat in that room for nearly five hours. Harper returned several times, telling me that they were continuing to run tests. I could sense that something was wrong, but he would never tell me what was happening. Needless to say, my hair was nearly white by the time he finally returned. Dr. Harper stepped into the room, a pained look resting on his face. I’d never seen him look like that before. “What is it?” I said, shaking from my anxiety. “Just tell me already, *please.” Harper sighed, taking a seat on one of the chairs. He began to rub his face. “I’m… I’m *so* sorry, Nicholas.” My heart dropped. “*What*?” “There’s been an… *unforeseen* issue,” he said, maintaining direct eye contact with me. I couldn’t help but feel uncomfortable staring into the eyes that once gave me hope. “What do you mean, Harper? Just fucking *tell me,*” I said, snapping. He didn’t seem to mind my outburst. “Well… the treatment. It… it seems to have affected *all* of your cells.” I frowned. “What? Are you saying it is trying to kill me? *All* of me?” “No… not exactly,” he said, sighing loudly. “The opposite, actually.” “What the hell are you talking about?” I asked. I wished he would just spit it out already. “Your body,” he said, standing. “It’s trying to heal itself, at an unbelievable rate. All damages are starting to disappear.” I shook my head, not believing what I was hearing. “What does that even *mean?* And how is that a bad thing? Doesn’t that mean the cancer is going away?” Harper shook his head slowly, his eyes full of pain. “I’m sorry, Nicholas. The treatment, it… it targeted *all* of your cells.” I thought for a few moments, the realization hitting me like a truck. “The cancer…?” “It’s beginning to spread,” he said, obviously nervous now. “*Very* quickly.” “What the fuck is this?” I asked, standing. “So I’m going to die even *sooner* now?” Harper raised his hands, trying to calm me. “No, Nicholas… we’re not certain that it’s going to kill you *at all.*” I placed my hands against my temples. “What the fuck… so the cancer will keep spreading, but it won’t kill me?” “We… we can give you some pain medication,” he said, leaning against the wall. “It should help with most of your future pains. Living with the cancer should be simple.” I could barely hear Dr. Harper anymore over my own rage. I began to cough violently; it was as if this conversation had woken the cancer back up. I was back in my car a short time later, with several bottles of pain medications and a promise to return the next day. I couldn’t believe that this was happening. I didn’t go back the next day, if you could believe it. Or the one after that. I could *feel* it; it’s hard to explain. They were right; the cancer was spreading. I don’t know how, but I *knew* it wasn’t just in my lungs anymore. Three days after my last hospital visit, I began to feel the pain. I woke up at about three in the morning, coughing violently. My lungs burned like crazy; it was as if I’d breathed in fire. I felt an unexpected wet spot on the inside of my arm as I coughed. I sat up in bed, spitting out blood into the cup that sat beside my bed. Rachel was waking up beside me. “Are you okay, baby?” she asked as I began to run for the bathroom. I locked the door behind me, vomiting into the toilet. The water turned a deep red as blood poured from my mouth. I couldn’t believe what I was looking at. Was I about to die? The vomiting subsided after a short time. I slumped against the side of the bathtub, staring at the ceiling. I was a bit lightheaded, but, aside from the general pain, I felt fine. I heard a soft knock at the bathroom door. “Do you want some toast?” The next few days were the same. Coughing fits leading to bloody vomit became the usual for me. I didn’t understand; I was no doctor, but I felt as if I had vomited enough blood to fill *three* of my bodies within the past few days. I couldn’t take it anymore. Harper’s pills had had no obvious effects. I needed to get help. I returned to the hospital. The nurses seemed shocked to see me; I suppose there was quite a drastic physical change. Harper felt the same way. “Oh my God,” he said, staring into my darkened eyes. “What the fuck did you do to me?” I cried out as Harper funneled me into a nearby room. A small child in the waiting room seemed terrified of me, but I didn’t blame him. I would be too. “Nicholas, have you been taking your medication?” he asked, studying me. ""You look like you've lost weight."" “I’ve taken almost *all* of your fucking medication,” I said, reaching into my pockets and throwing the empty bottles towards him. “All I’ve experienced is *more* pain, and vomit full of blood.” Harper looked to the empty bottles on the floor. “You took *all* of the medication?” “I figured more couldn’t hurt,” I said, shaking my head as I began to cough. “You know, with the whole *cancer* thing?” Harper looked as if he’d just seen a ghost. “Can… can we run some tests?” I figured I may as well; that was why I came, after all. The testing didn’t take as long as they had before. The results weren’t reassuring. Within just about a week, the cancer had spread from my lung to my stomach, liver, bladder, and brain. It wasn’t showing signs of stopping. And the worst part was, my body showed no signs of quitting. I lived this way for two more weeks. I was certain the cancer had spread even further. The medication did nothing to help me. My exponentially declining condition definitely affected Rachel. As far as she knew, I would be dead within the next week or so. God, if only she knew. My attitude began to change as the time went on. I would snap a lot more than I used to; I could sense this, but I couldn’t stop it. I knew Rachel just wanted to help me, but you have to understand that this took a toll on my mind. I started considering suicide about a month after the initial discovery. I practically lived in my bed, now. Moving any part of my body hurt like fucking hell. This was supposed to be my life, now. My body would never quit as the cancer continued to spread until it physically *couldn’t* anymore. If I didn’t end it all myself, when would it end for Rachel? I didn’t want her to stay with me like this forever. She deserved *so* much better. I put a lot of thought into it, and decided that I would end my own life. It was for the best; Rachel could move on, and I could finally rest. I seemed like the perfect plan, at the time. I knew exactly how I would do it. I forced myself out of bed one day when Rachel was out on the back porch and drove out into the city. I know now that it was a stupid choice, in my condition, but at the time I didn’t care. So what if I crashed my car? The plan *was* to kill myself, after all. I began to cry as my car pulled onto the main bridge into Boston. I couldn’t stop myself; I didn’t even realize how much emotion I’d had built up inside until the tears came. My car hummed quietly as I parked on the side of the bridge, stepping up to the railing on the edge. I squinted my eyes as I looked down towards the water; it was a pretty long fall. It would surely be enough to end this hell of an existence. I checked over my shoulder before swinging my right leg up over the ledge. My heart had started to beat quickly. I wasn’t afraid of leaving Rachel; no, I said my official “final” goodbyes to her weeks ago, just in case I ceased to wake up one morning. No, I was afraid for *myself.* Did I *really* want this? The sound of footsteps to my right caught my attention. In my dazed state, I hadn’t noticed the man approaching me. His arms were extended towards me, but he froze as he realized I had seen him. “Hey,” the man said, taking a step back, his hands up in the air. It was clear he was trying to stop me. “Don’t bother, man,” I said, shaking my head. “I’ve already made my decision.” “Please, man, don’t do this,” he said, sighing. “Do you need money? I can let you crash at my place, if you’d like. Let's just talk.” *Now,* I feel unbelievably grateful for the man’s kindness, but back then, I couldn’t help but feel annoyed. “You have no idea what my life has been like, man. There’s *so* much more to this than you could ever understand.” “You can’t do this,” he said, taking a step forward. “What about your family?” I didn’t want to have this conversation anymore. I swung my other leg over the railing, the man’s eyes widening as he leapt towards me. I saw the man peer over the ledge as I fell from the bridge. The air pressed against my back as I fell. For the first time in weeks, I felt completely at peace. My back smacked hard against the water. I screamed loudly as I connected with the river, my lungs instantly filling with water; I could quickly tell that the landing had broken my back. My heart began to sink as I realized I wasn’t *dead.* I instinctively attempted to return to the surface, struggling to move from the intense pain in my back, but I realized then that I should just stay under the water. I only had so much air left, anyways. I let myself sink slowly to the bottom of the Charles River, feeling the water begin to fill my lungs. Drowning was a horrifying feeling, but it would all be over soon. My brain began to feel fuzzy as I was starved of oxygen. I started to wiggle in a panic, my back sending even more pain throughout my body. What a fucking terrible way to die. It was becoming evident that this wasn’t working. I could tell that I had been underwater for far too long; I should have been dead by now. I pushed off of the bottom of the river, attempting to swim back to the surface. I couldn’t move without my back exploding in an intense pain. I sat at the bottom of the river for what felt like an eternity, continuously drowning without end. It was *excruciating*; I don’t really want to think about it anymore, frankly. My burning eyes eventually made out the shape of a man as he swam to the bottom of the river; the man on the bridge must have called for help. You should have seen the look of shock in the man’s eyes as he stared at a living man through his goggles. They took me back to the hospital. Rachel was there; that was how she found out about my treatment. She was obviously angry, and confused, but she stayed there with me, for a while at least. Dr. Harper came to my room after a time, when Rachel had gone down to the cafeteria. My eyes immediately began to water as I saw him. “Please fucking kill me,” I said, crying in my hospital bed. Harper sighed, shutting the door behind him. “Nicholas, what were you thinking?” “I can’t fucking live like this,” I said, squinting my eyes shut. “This is unbearable.” “I can’t kill you, Nicholas,” he said, scoffing. “Just *please fucking do it,*” I said, sobbing. “Just... just *think* about it, Nicholas,” he said, holding out his hands. “You are the first person to experience *eternal life.* You will *never* die. Through your pain, we can figure out how to make this work for *anyone,* without these unfortunate issues.” My eyes opened; I was fucking *angry.* “What the fuck is wrong with you?” “There is nothing wrong with me, Nicholas,” he said, heading for the door. “You just need to see the bigger picture here. You'll be a hero, I'm telling you,” he said, leaving without another word. The hospital let me out later that day. Apparently, my back *wasn’t* broken after all. I had been certain it had snapped when I hit the river; had I just been mistaken? Rachel stayed with me at home for a few days. She was afraid I was going to try to kill myself again. I told her repeatedly that I’d learned my lesson. She left the room one day to use the restroom. I took that as my chance. I stepped out of bed, my entire body aching. I needed to *fucking die.* I drove back into Boston. The bridge wasn’t high enough of a fall, evidently. I needed something *taller.* I parked my car in a parking garage near the John Hancock Tower. The walk there was horrific; I didn’t care. It would be over soon. I stepped into the building, forcing my way through the lobby. Several men in dark business suits gave me odd looks as I shuffled, but I ignored them. A man wheeling around a bucket of water with a mop stood in front of the elevator. He turned over his shoulder as I stepped up to him, confusion in his eyes. “Hey, who are you?” he asked, obviously only commenting because of my physical appearance. I slipped my hand out from my jacket pocket, pulling out a steak knife. “Take me to the roof.” The man gave me an odd look; he frankly didn’t seem to be very afraid of the knife. Even still, the man took me into the elevator, leading me up to the top floor. The man eyed me nervously as we rode the elevator up to the roof. He looked as if he wanted to speak, but wasn't sure how I would react if he did. I obviously didn't want to hurt this man; I really hoped that he wouldn't try to put up a fight. We stepped out of the elevator once we reached the top floor. “What is this, man?” he said, leading me towards the end of the hallway “What are you doing here?” “Just let me up on the roof,” I said, groaning in pain. “That’s all I want you to do.” The man unlocked the door, stepping backwards as he pulled it open. “Are you going to kill yourself…?” I stepped past the man, nodding towards him. “Don’t worry about me, man. Thank you,” I said, dropping the knife behind me as I stumbled out onto the roof. I moved slightly faster as I walked towards the edge of the roof, a disturbing feeling of exciting flowing through me. This was it. The sound of footsteps behind me caused me to turn. The janitor was charging towards me, ready to tackle me to the ground. I spun, pushing off the ground with my feet. I fought through the pain, leaping off of the edge of the tower. I could hear the man yelling above me as I fell towards the street below. Through my momentum, I had started to spin through the air. My heart felt as if it were in my throat, but I was *happy.* The ground was approaching me quickly. This was finally the end to my suffering. My head smashed hard against the sidewalk. A loud crack exploded in my ears. The pain was instantaneous. My head bent at a horrific angle, my neck breaking instantly. A woman walking down the street dropped her coffee, screaming in horror. I could feel blood pouring from my neck; the skin had torn as I hit the ground. I could tell that my skull had split open. I hope you never have to experience the feeling of the air touching your brain. I couldn't see out of my right eye; I quickly realized that it was resting on the sidewalk beside me, still attached by the optic nerve. I tried to stand, realizing that I couldn’t feel my legs or arms. I tried to scream, but blood had filled what was left of my torn esophagus. I writhed on the ground, the pain indescribable. I was entirely conscious as the ambulance essentially scooped me off of the ground and into the vehicle. *Why was I fucking alive?* My skull had resealed itself by the time we arrived at the hospital. I was already beginning to feel my toes again by the time Dr. Harper came to my room. Our conversation was painfully similar to our last. They kept me there for almost a month. When they finally let me go home, I found it empty. Rachel was gone. I don’t know what they had told her, but she obviously couldn’t take it anymore. In all honesty, I’m *glad* she’s gone. For *her* sake. *I can’t fucking die.* It has been nearly four months since I received my treatment. I can’t take this shit anymore. I know for a fact that the hospital released me knowing fully well that I would try to kill myself again. How else could they test my body’s self-healing if I didn’t receive more life-threatening injuries? I can’t physically end this nightmare myself. Any time I get close to doing so - at least, what I *think* is close to doing so - I lose mobility. I can't see this through on my own. That’s why I write to you now. I have typed out this story, I have pushed through the pain of moving my fingers, as a cry for help. If you are anywhere near Boston, and are capable of killing me in a way you think I won’t be able to come back, *please,* come find me. I can’t fucking take this pain anymore. I’m a walking meat-bag of fucking cancer. It hurts to *breath.* [Please fucking kill me.](http://www.twitter.com/milesbruckner)",
607,"Update: My Daughter’s Body is Stuck Inside a WallI don't know exactly when we went past our breaking point. Was it [when this all started](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cuul6c/my_daughters_hand_is_stuck_inside_a_wall/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app ) or [when things got worse](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cv9qa0/update_my_daughters_arm_is_stuck_inside_a_wall/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app )? Either way, it's happened. There isn't much else I can describe about what has transpired here [after the incident with the priest](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cvq104/update_my_daughters_arm_is_still_stuck_inside_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app ) other than a complete and total loss of sanity. I think I was the first one to really lose it. Lack of sleep, trying to keep Marcy as comfortable as possible; and trying to keep a straight face myself despite the circumstances were likely the main cause. But the moment that really made me start to question everything was around lunch time yesterday. I've had to resort to a liquid diet for Marcy because of the way she is fused with the wall. She had only barely open her mouth on the left side and I'm feeding her with a straw. For the most part when this happens, she is quiet and cooperative because she is hungry. But yesterday something different happened. ""Mommy.... why did they do it?"" she whispered as she took another sip of hot broth. ""Do what sweetie?"" I asked. ""The walls. They changed the color. Why did they change the color?"" Marcy whimpered. I frowned and ran the back of my palm against her forehead to check her for a fever and I muttered, ""Baby... what are you talking about?"" ""In... the upstairs bedroom... they covered it up... I don't know why they did it..."" she complained. She seemed tired so I kissed her head and told her I was going to go take a nap. Stan came to be beside her as I gently walked up the stairs, pondering over what she had told me. Eventually I found myself standing outside of Stan's office. The upstairs 'bedroom' that Marcy had been talking about. As I stared into the room, I thought back to when we first bought this house. The realtor had suggested if we ever wanted to expand our family, that the room could be a great nursery. Why had she said that? I stepped into the room and stared at the walls the patterns that were decorating them before finally deciding to rip it all off. As I began to tear it down, I heard sharp sounds from downstairs. Then Stan was running up the stairs like a wild man. ""What the fuck are you doing??"" he asked as he burst into the room. I kept stripping off the wallpaper and ignoring him as he grabbed my hand and forced me to look at him face to face. ""Have you lost your mind? While you're in here dismantling the house our little girl is downstairs crying because she said it feels like you are peeling her skin off! We agreed not to do anything like this!"" he muttered. I pulled away from him and said with a shaky voice. ""What else am I supposed to do? I'm trying to figure out what this fucking house wants! It's not like I can talk to the walls!"" I sobbed. Stan relaxed and held me for a moment as I broke down and dropped some of the wallpaper I was holding. ""I'm sorry... I over reacted. I'm sure whatever you were doing was intended to help her,"" he admitted as he squinted his eyes and looked past me on the wall. He let go of me for a moment and went toward it, gently peeling the wallpaper off to reveal what appeared to be a measuring chart of some kind. ""What is that?"" he asked. I examined it as well and realized it had the scribblings of a child's hand on the wall with a name. *Jasper Hunt- age 10* it said. ""Did you know that was back there?"" Stan asked. I shook my head and replied, ""'Marcy was talking about it like she knew... but I don't see how that is possible...."" He examined it closely, and I could see his brain firing to figure out what to do with this new information. ""Unless we really *can* talk to the walls,"" he realized. ""You think the house is the one that was speaking to me?"" I whispered. It sounded ridiculous to say. But given all that we had experienced we couldn't rule anything out. ""I think it's trying to tell us something..."" Stan paused as he moved over to his desk and began to rifle through some old files. ""What are you looking for?"" I asked. He slammed it closed and muttered to himself. ""I thought I kept the info on the real estate agent. Damn it, I can't find it anywhere,"" Stan admitted. ""It was Samantha something,"" I chimed in, although my brain was so tired I couldn't imagine where he was going with this. He paused and kissed my cheek and said, ""I'm going to try and google the info and get them on the phone. Maybe find out who the previous owners of this house were."" ""Okay... what do you want me to do?"" I asked. He rubbed his chin for a moment and then directed me toward the stairs. ""Keep Marcy talking. If the house can tell us anything else it could help us get her out,"" he demanded. I nodded, sprinting down the steps to where my little girl was whimpering and pulling her shirt up a tad to scratch at her belly. As I got closer I could tell that she had developed a rash of some kind. ""Hey baby, are you okay?"" I said as I sat along side her. ""Mommy... why do you keep hurting me?"" She asked as tears streamed down her face. She could barely even get the words out. Just to hear her say that made me feel like I wanted to die. I touched her cheek and smiled gently. ""Oh baby no... we don't want to hurt you. We want to help you. I... I found what was under the walls. It was another little boy used to live here and draw on the walls too,"" I said. ""Did the wall eat him too?"" she asked anxiously. I didn't actually know the answer to that question. And the fact that she asked it made me even more terrified. I bit my lip and came up with a lie, wondering when the house would use our daughter to speak again. ""No baby he's ok... his name was Jasper. I'm sure his family moved before we came here,"" I said softly. ""Why is it eating me?"" Marcy asked, fumbling to find the words as she looked at the wall. ""I'm sorry..."" she said with trembling lips as she touched the wall with her free hand. Stan was at the edge of the hall with a grim look on his face that told me he had bad news. ""The realtor that sold us this place doesn't work at the company anymore. And they don't really have any files on hand about the previous owners,"" he whispered as I joined him. ""What? Nothing? Not even a forward address?"" I asked. ""All the agent could tell me for sure is this property had been on the market for 6 years and we got it at a reduced price cause it wasn't selling,"" Stan admitted. I covered my mouth, realizing that such a simple thing could have horrific implications now. Had the wall actually consumed poor little Jasper too? ""Has she told you anything yet?"" Stan asked. ""Only that she is scared... and that I don't know how the house communicates yet,"" I paused and sighed deeply, trying not to lose it. ""Are we even listening to ourselves?"" I said in exasperation. ""Are we really expecting this house to talk to us?"" ""We've exhausted traditional means. Medicine isn't working. Machinery won't break down the wall. And we saw that priest disappear before our eyes. We can't deny this is real,"" he told me. As though to prove his point he walked over to the wall and began to bark a few commands. ""Listen to me! I know you can hear me cause of what you've done to my daughter! She is innocent do you hear me? I demand you take me instead,"" Stan ordered. Of course, there was no response. Instead Marcy only complained that her pain was returning and she felt itchy again. I still didn't know what that meant in connection to the house but Stan was growing frustrated. ""What do you want from us??"" he screamed. ""I swear to god. Answer me now before I fucking burn you to the ground!!"" That evoked a response from the wall or rather Marcy as she screamed again and yelled, ""It's pulling me!! Mommy!!"" I instantly grabbed at her arm."" ""No please!! Please!! Please he didn't mean it!!"" I begged. Marcy's right nostril was now within the wall and all of her right eye. Only a sliver of her mouth was out enough for her to cry out to us. Then it seemed to stop and I shoved Stan back. ""Are you crazy?? Do you want to lose her altogether??"" I screamed. He ignored me and went back to his office. I stood there for a moment, comforting Marcy and I even gently touched the wall and muttered an apology. ""Please... just tell us what you want. We'll do it. Anything. Just please let our little girl go,"" I whispered. I slumped to the floor and kept staring at the paneling, expecting any sort of response. But neither Marcy nor the wall were showing any signs of talking. Was it angry because of Stan's threat? I went upstairs to confront him about it. He was in the office searching for something amid our many boxes that we never got around to sorting and I muttered, ""Stan... I know this sounds crazy. But we have to try to appease the house."" ""We've tried that. We can't bring back the old residents. So I'm tired of compromising with a fucking demon,"" he said as he finally found what he was looking for. It was a sledgehammer. ""Stan... what are you doing?"" I whispered. ""It thinks I'm bluffing. I'll show it what real pain is,"" he said. His face told me he was serious. But I could see pain and anger in his eyes. He wasn't thinking this through. He walked back down stairs to the den. ""We can't!! You said it yourself! It'll hurt her more than help!!"" I begged. ""We know that some parts of the house can be hurt. If this... thing wants to survive... it's going to have to start cooperating,"" he snarled as he turned to the wall and began to smash it apart. Instantly Marcy began to holler. We could see it was causing her little body to seize up. ""Don't do this!!"" I told him. ""I'm not stopping until it lets her go,"" Stan said firmly. ""You hear that?? I'm fucking tearing you down!!"" he shouted. I ran downstairs, desperate to try and hold on to Marcy before the wall started pulling again. ""If you keep this up she'll be gone!"" I screamed. ""It's her or the house. If it takes her I won't stop until this whole place is rubble,"" Stan decided. I squeezed my daughter's hand, trying to keep her from feeling the pain. But instead of pulling her further into the wall, the house had a different response this time. I could see it happening even before she started to make a sound. Something was moving under her skin. It was a small gentle ripple against her arm, before I realized that it was an insect. A termite burrowing it's way out of my daughter's arm. Before I knew what was happening, more of the insects began to dig themselves out of her body in different places. ""Stan!!! Stan stop!!"" I shouted at the top of my lungs. This time my husband listened. He dropped the sledgehammer and fell to his knees as he saw the termite swarm that was now invading our little girl's body. ""Dear Jesus..."" he muttered as he hurried to clean her off and get the insects away. But who knew how many of them were still inside of her? Another few minutes passed with nothing but Marcy's gentle sobs. Eventually she fell asleep and Stan and I stood there, broken and defeated by the house. ""Why is this happening?"" my husband asked as he got down on his knees and started to plead with the house. ""I don't know what you want. I'm sorry... I just want my daughter back. Please... for the love of all that is holy in this world... please give me a sign,"" he said. I squeezed his hand and we waited there, trying to see if anything would happen. Instead it was just more silence. Stan stood up, shaking his head in disgust as he prepared to go back upstairs. ""Momma, did you feel that?"" Marcy whispered as we stood up. She looked confused, but not frightened. I looked toward her. ""Feel what sweetie?"" ""It felt like... something pushing its way out,"" she said. That was when I noticed it. I approached the wall and reached my hand out to touch the gentle ripples in the pattern. There were five of them altogether, jutting out from the wall about six feet from where Marcy was stuck. As I watched in awestruck horror, the wallpaper began to peel away and show what appeared to be five little fingers sticking out.

611,"I’m gonna fucking dieA few days a go my mom confronted me about my sexuality and I was too lazy to fucking lie so I said yes, she said that she loves me and all that which all sounded good till she said “your my son and we will normalize you” ( I know how weird it sounds weird but she said it in Arabic so it sounded less weird) she said it’s just a faze and whatever and said shit like it’s not the west and you can’t live with a guy and said it’s just hormones then said it’s from the “Jews” and the media then blanked my childhood best friend who I lost my virginity to which she eventually found out about and blamed him and said how he “raped my mind” till she calmed down and I had to say I’m gay, I want to live with a guy and marry a guy. She said it’s normal to feel that way now but it’s “not normal” and one thing led to another and I’m starting conversion therapy next week which even if it could I won’t let change me because her biggest reason for me to change is that I’m “Muslim”, good thing I’m an atheist then.

And sitting in your room alone at night, with your cell phone beating your meat to some banging hot chick, does that really make you happy? Honestly, there are skills, talents, jobs that you were created for. Do you really want to die being a bloody wanker? We never know when our time is up, so ask yourself. If you had a death counter above your head and it was a predetermined time, would you still be the same? Fuck no, you'd work your fucking ass off trying to make an impression because at the end of the day you know you won't be here one day. What I'm trying to tell you is you have the potential to change your fucking life, you are far stronger than any fucking addiction and your greatest fear should be never reaching your greatest potential. Not being afraid of people, change, and life itself. So turn off the fucking porn, get the fuck off reddit, get off your fucking ass and get to work. Have a great rest of your fucking day.

619,"Seeing men objectively less attractive than me with partners makes me want to fucking die.I originally made this post by accident on a different account but deleted it. (I'm a fucking dipshit retard, I know). I’ve been trying for the last year to lose weight and have been somewhat successful (50+lbs). Still, obviously, I get no attention from women whatsoever. As the title suggests, seeing beautiful women with guys that are waaaayy fucking fatter than me is perhaps the most potent suicide fuel there is. I had to watch my adorable, petite brunette coworker talk to her fucking ogre-looking SO yesterday. It was fucking hideous. This is what I get for fighting a food addiction? This is what I get for toiling for all this time? To have to still be ignored and alienated and then be mocked by the sight of fat lumbering dipshits with gorgeous women on their arms? What the fuck? Not having a relationship has destroyed my life, and I have to deal with seeing people who treat their bodies with nothing but indifference and poor lifestyles get rewarded. I fucking want to die. I am literally in pain every waking moment of the day. Fuck everything.",
620,"If Olaf just wants to fucking die, why doesn't he actually go fight those dudes that are nearly impossible to kill?Lore-wise, Olaf is like, this dude who wants an honorable death, similar to Saurfang in WoW but less Orcish, he is getting kinda old for a Warrior as he is nearly 50 and he still hasn't yet been bested in battle by anyone, and that's kind of his thing. He is also on Sejuani's faction which is warlike and shit but I doubt Olaf would want to go against his own tribe. However, most other ""competitors"" are out of reach. He probably wouldn't be able to fight Darius or Garen on head-to-head combat, because, he'd probably have to run down an entire army just to be able look at then. Tryndamere would be an obvious ""partner"" he could try to fight, but although he is brave and ""borderline immortal"", Olaf would just run into the same problem as before. He'd probably not be able to get even close to the fucker because Tryndamere just wouldn't bother dealing with that shit. He'd just let the Avarosan footmen deal with the Barbarian the same way he lets the Avarosan sentries deal with his wife. And then you have those other puny fighters like Riven or Yasuo who'd just fucking die?? Like, not only are they hidden somewhere in Ionia, they'd wouldn't even put up a fair fight if they were to fight this absolutely battle-hardened barbarian (not ingame though cuz they sell a lot of skins and Riot needs to make them $$$) So this leaves those guys that roam around the map that everyone knows where they are because, well, they just kill everything, yet they work alone like all the time. Shit like Sion would probably be easier than Darius to get to because, well, not only is he fucking huge, he is also extremely strong and he doesn't give a fuck about no army. He ""accidentally"" kills some Trifarian soldiers during battles because those Trifarian dudes don't bother looking at the minimap and noticing the absolute fucking mammoth coming their way. Another potential target would be Aatrox. Not only is he also fucking huge, but he is kinda easy to spot (if you hear about a bunch of people dying somewhere in the deserts of Shurima on Fox News or something, he is probably there doing his thing). Aatrox doesn't hide, Aatrox doesn't have an entire army behind him to back him up, Aatrox just wants to fucking die too and to take the entire world with him along the way, idk, it seems like a win-win scenario. You either die to someone who bests you in battle or you kill a dude that commits at least 3 massacres every week and people go like ""hey that's cool Olaf, now can you go back to herding sheep and shit?"" He could also go for Mordekaiser but he'd probably have to fight a million shitty ghouls just to get to him so what even is the point. Also, he doesn't even live in our own world anymore so he'd need to die himself to even find the dude in the first place. And there's like other fighters which are like ""too big to handle"". Like, yeah, he'd probably die against Malphite but that's because he is literally a fucking mountain. Not even honorable at that point tbh, just a fancy suicide. Cho'gath isn't as tall but still probably too tall to beat. --- Also, kinda off-topic but I always felt it was kinda weird people refer to Malphite as a dude. He legit walks around naked yet I see no mountain cock.",

648,"I'm a dumbass and I'm going to fucking die. I hate crushes.So obviously there's this guy I like. Sadly he's from my work. Sadly he knows my family. Ugh. But I've been seriously crushing on him for like the last 4 months (I thought he was cute as fuck the moment I met him tho ha), when he started like truly interacting with me. Like he teases me and shit. Anyway, He told me something about liking me like a month and a half ago but... not like... like like but also that's what he could have been going for because I fucked up and completely couldnt word correctly and somehow he got this idea I liked someone else and not him and just. Ugh. I fucked up. He had this really annoyed/upset look on his face if you know what I mean. but I couldnt think and I left without fixing it. Then I tried texting him? asking what he meant. No reply. And the next day I saw him he kinda avoided me and was like super tense when he teased me and I. Like I knew what I needed to do but it's hard for me to say what I need to say when other people are around you know. So like the dick I am I didnt say anything. Month goes by, very little amount of teasing and he's around someone ALL THE TIME. And everytime there is an opportunity I either dont even think about it as an opportunity or you know, I coward out. The other day I somehow got the courage to do it and even go way out of my way too and he acted like he had no idea what I was saying. That's the last time I saw him and omfg. IM SO FUCKING AWKWARD AND CRINGEY. UUUUGH SAVE ME IM TOTALLY FUCKED. But I've also been thinking he might piece it together and might figure it out himself and if he doesnt well obviously he wouldnt be as smart as I think he is. But also maybe he doesnt actually like me. good god. IM SO EMBARRASSING. But anyway the reason I'm here, the week that first thing happened, like before it happened I had this dream where I kissed him after he explained to me how he didnt understand how I wasnt getting he liked me. Like hello dream thanks for that messaging. But like, I've had crushes before but I could never picture being with them let alone have a dream about passionately kissing them. Like again thanks brain for that messaging. So now after this fucked catastrophe I brought on myself, Last night I just had the SOFTEST dreams. DREAMS! THERE WERE TWO OF THEM. I dont remember one of them very greatly but we were being really silly and dancing and laughing and JUST HOLY FUCK. That was the second dream. The one before it was SO SOFT TOO. All I remember about it was we were standing next to each other and I think I was worrying about him liking me or something. I think it was very much a ""if he figured it out and he really did like me"" scenario. But he like took my hand in his so gently and locked our fingers together before he smiled and leaned down and kissed me. At a much different pace then the other dream. Anyway I'm dead and my mind is just. Why mind. Why. Why now. (obviously because I'm a dumbass) Hopefully this all is somewhat understandable.",

It’s just when she ignores me all night after standing me up on dates that trigger me. She has cheated on me many times and developed relationships with people behind my back. I cannot trust this person whatsoever ever. She just knows my trauma because it happened to her and she is mentally ill as well. She is really selfish though or at least I feel like because she will respond with maybe a “hey” after I give like a wall of text explaining how she made me feel and how it hurts. She even said she doesn’t care. She is the only one I’ve been this intimate with and if she doesn’t stop I know I will kill myself.

700,"Is there no such thing as ""moderate"" in this conversation?Hello Internet, For context, I'm just a black woman (26F) from West Philly. I'm going to try to make this post as coherent as possible but might fail just because of how utterly confused I am about this topic in particular. Somehow, someway I seem to have stumbled into this whole gender thing and my basic thoughts on this gender thing apparently makes me highly conservative in modern times. In stumbling upon this discussion, I happened upon this ""Gender Critical"" reddit page. I've never been invested in subscribing to any set philosophy and I honestly don't know much about feminism in an academic sense, but I found the basic premise of that page to be pretty much common sense. After commenting on a few posts there I get a direct message from the main feminism reddit page stating that I've been banned from participating due to the fact that I comment on GC and there's no room for people like me in the feminist community. In a post on the feminism reddit page I stumbled upon, someone was asking why GC views never appeared on the page to which there were long essay responses about how ""we let TERFS be here but it's not long before they start posting transphobic BS so they get banned."" So I'm sure that is true but I what's also true is that they preemptively ban people who don't agree to all points of a particular philosophy which is fine it's just a big jarring. That also explains why so many people who post on GC use what they've been calling ""burner accounts."" Because you either agree with everything or you're a Nazi. There have been select times over the past few years that I've heard about how big of a deal pronouns are and that there's a lot of new ones people can use. I honestly just considered it to be one of those new things white people are getting wound up about (no offense). I still kind of think that because... well... in my experience that's who I see bringing it up. Like once I was having pretty bad period cramps and was complaining about the curse of being a woman and a random person was like ""don't exclude trans women"" to which I just kind of blankly stared back and went about my day. Naturally, I ask one of my white friends about it. I asked her ""is there a difference between sex and gender?"" She tells me ""sex refers to your body, gender refers to your mind, and if your body and mind don't match up then you're trans."" Ok, simple enough. But I start digging a bit. Lots of capslocking around the internet of ""TRANS WOMEN ARE WOMEN"" and ""DEATH TO TERFS"" and a lot of conflict about bathrooms. I wasn't born yesterday. I know what a sex change is. But I had no idea the people who got them honestly believed they were the opposite sex, I just thought they desired for some reason to be perceived that way so they did and life moves on. So why is it such a big deal now? Well I figure the reason it's such a big deal now is because the conversation has evolved. Gender dysphoria, for all intents and purposes, is a mental illness. If your mind has you feeling some type of way so much the wrong pronoun will literally make you kill yourself then I think it's safe to say there's an issue. Is getting a sex change the best solution? Probably. I assumed there's lots of therapy involved for people considering that course of action since most doctors won't even let a woman get her tubes tied before age 40. Then I learn all of these things about hormones. I knew hormones were powerful but DAAANG. However then I hear about kids getting on these in their teens and how being a ""detransitioner"" is bad because trans people see it as a personal attack. Maybe I'm just out of the loop but as a teen people were labeling themselves based on which emo band they liked most. Now all the anxiety seems to be placed on sexuality and gender... to which I'll say there are pros and cons. Like I'm asexual, never really thought about it until my twenties, stumbled upon the definition and just said ""oh, ok."" But even in the asexual corners of the internet you'll see teens making long posts about how questioning if they're asexual or not is triggering their suicidal tendencies and I just think ""CHILD WHERE ARE YOUR PARENTS?"" I feel like I'm older than I am. Anyway, back to gender. Also in the asexual corner of the internet there's a large trans community since I guess having issues with your body is going to have an impact on your interest in getting frisky. Literally at least once a day I'll see a post that goes something along the lines of ""I'm AFAB but I hate pink, never liked playing with dolls, most of my friends are boys, and I honestly find other girls to be annoying. Am I trans?"" To which I say ""Feelings about the color pink has nothing to do with being a woman."" So there is where I draw the line, this doubling down on stereotypes that I've been fighting my whole life against make it seem like being male female comes with preset personalities, likes, and dislikes. I thought we were way past this? Yet it seems like it's coming back. This type of talk usually comes in with the notion that ""you don't need to be dysphoric to be trans, sometimes you just feel euphoric presenting as your gender of choice."" So that's why when I stumbled upon GC I was relieved thinking ""oh ok, most people don't believe that."" Little did I know this was seen the same as being the alt right. Also why is it bad to accept that trans women are different from cis women? I thought that was obvious? I just feel like there's no room to talk about this stuff. It's either all or nothing.",
701,"My Dad ended his life last nightI am in shock. My Dad has threatened to take his life many times throughout his life but this time, last night, he actually did it. Growing up, my Dad made it obvious how much he loved me and my siblings. He raised us to make good choices and taught us to serve others. He was a great man with a heart of gold but his mental health had begun to deteriorate as we got older. As his mental health declined, so did his ability to be a healthy father. For context: He was a terrible alcoholic, manipulative, and abusive to my mom and siblings especially while drunk. He has been in and out of rehab several times trying to fight his addiction but he eventually gave up trying to be sober through traditional rehabilitation. Despite this, he was a very big part of my life. He raised my siblings and me until I was about 16 years old (I'm now 25 years old). At that point, his marriage with my mom rapidly deteriorated until they eventually divorced. To say the divorce wasn't pretty is putting it pretty mildly. My Dad was a state cop at the time who sometimes abused his power to get back at my mom. One time, he even arrested my mother in front of my entire family on phony charges. His erratic behavior and excessive drinking eventually led to him losing his job. His Alcohol addiction has landed him in the hospital over and over again. It was always very hard on my family. While drunk, he'd often say or do certain things to get attention. This included suicide threats, lies about being hunted by bad people he supposedly owed money to or lying about having cancer. It seemed like my dad was always dying over something and it really took a toll on all of us who were constantly hurt by him. Eventually, he remarried and it seemed like things were turning up. Unfortunately, he destroyed that marriage too in less than a year by getting caught in a police sting involving drugs and prostitutes. My Dad seemed to sabotage every relationship he ever had except for the one he shared with my brother. My brother and father always had an unbreakable bond. They were hardcore fishing buddies. My brother always believed in my Dad despite my father's behavior. No matter how many times he let my brother down, my brother always maintained a relationship with my father even when my Dad made it nearly impossible to do so. As for myself, I cut him off. I was fed up with how much he hurt me and my family. He was physically abusive to me and emotionally unavailable when I needed his help. It felt easier to just distance myself from him so I can begin healing. I was open to having a relationship with my Dad again but I wanted it to happen after I had experienced some healing. Meanwhile, my Dad would continue to make life destructive decisions that discouraged me from letting him into my life again. My Dad ran away to the Philippines and then moved on to Vietnam for many years before making his way back to the states. Once he was back, I was about 21 years old. At that time I was ready to forgive and let him in my life again. I really tried but it was difficult. He was still a terrible alcoholic and clearly had not changed very much. However, he had a significant change in tone. Whereas he used to resent and blame my mom for all of his terrible life decisions, he now felt great sorrow and ultimate shame for what he had done. I felt bad for him and he clearly felt pretty bad for himself too because he didn't know how to talk to me without crying and sobbing about all that he'd lost. I wanted to help him but I didn't really know how to. I started by calling him and answering his calls now and then. Every once in a blue moon, we would meet up, have lunch or dinner. I visited him at the hospital after he got too drunk (again). I even introduced to him my last girlfriend in an attempt to include him more in my life. I wasn't doing much but I was trying. Over time it became difficult to see him or take his calls because he would always victimize himself during every phone call. He would constantly sob over and over whenever I talked to him on the phone whether he was drunk or just mad at the world for the cards life dealt him. This loose relationship I had with him began to feel like too much. I could never talk to him about my problems or my life because he was so fixated on his own misery. So I began screening his calls and even avoiding him at times just as I did before. Even with that, I still managed to see him once or twice a year to catch lunch or dinner as a concerted effort to be a small part of his life. Every now and then I'd still answer his calls but I only answered if I felt emotionally available to listen to yet another sob story about how awful his life is. This was the relationship I maintained with him pretty much until he ended his life. I really thought that perhaps things would turn around and I might be able to continue building my relationship with him again but that obviously didn't work out. I believed this as he gradually got better (not good but better) over time. He even managed to make a career again. He became a truck driver for several years. This managed to be a good thing for him because it kept him sober. As long as he was working, he was sober. Driving truck became a major point of stability for him. He seemed to be getting a little bit happier and I feel proud of what he accomplished late in his life in regards to his late-career. Of course, this didn't end his misery calls I would get but he seemed to have a bit more confidence in his newfound career. As time went on, he took notice of a job opening from Walmart as a driver. It paid really well and he was qualified. He applied and got the job and was so excited! The prospect of his new job seemed to really boost his confidence. He would tell us that he was going to eventually buy a new yacht to live on once he earned enough money. He loved the ocean so much that he wanted to live on it. He was so fixated on this yacht idea. It was refreshing to hear his newfound excitement. He was scheduled to start his new job at the end of December. He quit his old job and was ready to start his new one. This left him with a couple of weeks of time in hand to enjoy the holiday season with my brother. My brother just got home from the military and didn't have much time so he partitioned his time carefully to hang out with his Dad and then with us when he flew down here. During my Dad's time with my brother, his wife, and little child, my Dad quickly returned to drinking with too much time on his hands. This made things difficult for my brother and his family. My Dad felt lots of shame during this time as he spent much of his limited time with my brother drunk. He eventually landed himself in the hospital again leading up to Christmas. My Dad was once again throwing himself into the hospital like he always does because he can't stop drinking. At the hospital, Walmart decided to inform him on Christmas day that he would not be getting the job they had previously offered him. They denied him the job they offered him based on one preventable accident he had within the last few years where he accidentally dinged someone's door. I believe this is what killed him. He was so excited about that job and Walmart just had to take it away during his most vulnerable time. After being released from the hospital, he called my mom and my uncle as my Dad was understandably upset. Despite the hospital staff, (or the police, I'm not sure which) reporting he was suicidal, he was allowed to leave the hospital. The police left him alone at his current place with the intent of doing a welfare check the next day. That day my dad had expressed to both my mom and my uncle that he might not make it through the night. My mom championed him to stay strong. Feeling uplifted, my Dad told my mom he would pull himself together and go back to rehab and get help. He seemed to convince my mom, my uncle, and the police that he was okay. That night, my dad tried to call me a little after 10 pm. I missed his call. That night I got into an ugly argument with one of my siblings and the last person I wanted to talk to was my Dad. And so I didn't call him back. That was my last opportunity to talk to my father and I ignored it. I can't even begin to express the amount of anger I have with myself for not taking that call. It is devastating. Following that missed call, my Dad hung himself shortly after midnight on December 28th. My family is completely devastated, leaving me and both my sisters crushed, and my brother completely broken. I feel sorry for my family, I feel sorry for myself, I feel sorry for my father who was so miserable he ended his life a few short days after Christmas. It doesn't feel real. My Dad always pulled stunts like these and came out of it in one piece but this time was different. I wish I could tell my Dad I love him one last time. I wish I could hear him talk about his yacht idea again. I wish I could do anything to go back and make myself available to him during his most difficult times. I wish I could have played Mario Maker 2 with him so I could rekindle the times we spent playing the original Super Mario Bros games we played together when I was little. I wish I would have put more effort into building a relationship with him despite the way he acted. I wish he could meet my future wife and children and eventually seen the man I'd become. I thought maybe things would eventually change where he and I could truly bond again. I never felt like he got to know the real me over these past years as he made nearly every conversation I had with him about himself but now he won't ever get the chance. Despite the challenges that existed between me and my Dad, I wish I would have used whatever time I had left with him to make the most of our relationship. But now that option is no longer available to me. He is gone and I am left hoping that God is taking care of Him. I hope God is hugging him and crying with him. And I hope that my Dad can once again breathe easy. I wish he could have fought to be with me a little longer but he is gone and I can't change that. I love him. I wish I did a better job of expressing that to him. I wish I could have cried with him about his job and held his hand during his greatest moments of hardship and struggle. What I would give to buy back the time I could have spent building a relationship with him. Several weeks prior to his death, I asked him to go to counseling. Several times, much earlier in his life, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Knowing this, I felt that counseling would do him much good. He didn't go and I really wish he did. My Dad lost his life to mental illness. If there is anything anyone can take away from reading this is that mental illness is very real. Please reach out to those who are hurting and raise awareness in your communities. I wish this was all a nightmare I could wake up from with a newfound understanding of how fragile life is. Unfortunately, this isn't a dream I can wake up from and the consequences of my Dad's suicide are very real. Value the time you have with your loved ones you have now and maybe go easier on those who make having a relationship more challenging. We are all human and we all need love. In the end, I think all my Dad wanted was for people to love him and I feel crushed that I didn't do more to supply that love to him. Post-note: Forgive me for any errors, typos, or grammatical mistakes made within this post. I wrote this deep in the night and now I'm finally going to bed. Thank you for reading. Edit: Thank you so much, everyone, for your love and support. I am overwhelmed by how much people have viewed and replied to this post and also grateful that I was able to add a little amount of awareness in regard to mental illness. I appreciate your condolences and unwavering kindness. Furthermore, I am grateful for all those who offered their counsel and advice. I will likely begin seeing a therapist to cope with these recent events. I am especially grateful to all those who shared their own stories in regards to their own experienced trauma. Your stories show the world that nobody is truly alone and your voice raises much-needed awareness regarding mental illnesses that claim the lives of many around the world. I welcome anyone who reads this post to feel free to share their stories. I wrote this post very late last night (technically very early this morning as I was well past midnight) as a means to process my own grief and raise any amount of awareness I can concerning mental illness. I am humbled that so many people took the time to read and reply to my post. What happened to my Dad was a tragedy and I hope his story can influence others to take mental illness more seriously. It will be hard for me to reply to everyone. Please forgive me if I don't reply to your post. I will try to reply to some of you but I am currently focused on grieving and the upcoming funeral for my father. Thank you all for your support.",
702,"Boogie2988 criticism megathread 2.0**Disclaimer:** This thread is a collection of criticisms of youtuber Boogie2988's public online behavior. Each and every criticism is backed up by screenshots and video clips directly from the source in their full context. All sources of information in this thread are publicly available shared publicly by the parties involved. No where in this thread is Boogie being accused of beating his wife or anything he didn't say or do. #**Boogie's inconsistent and contradictory claims about having bipolar disorder:** Boogie is often criticized for using his mental health as an excuse for his terrible behavior. Recently the validity of one of his many self-proclaimed mental health issues came into question. Leading many to question if he was lying to garner sympathy. - On Oct 10th 2019, In response to a user on twitter, Boogie claims he has never been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and never claimed to have been diagnosed either: https://i.imgur.com/H1EEjlB.png - However, in a reddit post made by him on March 28th 2012 he listed three mental disorders he ""overcame"" during his life, one of which he claims was Bipolar personality disorder. He further emphasized that these were ""medically diagnosed"" disorders: https://i.imgur.com/ijjkOkZ.png - In 2020, when questioned in Twitter messages about [this inconsistency](https://i.imgur.com/bkGdxYX.png) Boogie changed his story once again, now claiming he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder as a child, which is what his 2012 reddit post was referring to. Albeit still contradicting his 2019 tweet about never being diagnosed: https://i.imgur.com/DFaFu94.png #**Boogie's egirl controversy (fake apologies, lies, and censorship):** - In March of 2019 Boogie randomly decided to tag various female content creators in a tweet he made. Calling them ""e-girls"" and going on about how ""super cute"" he thought they were. https://i.imgur.com/vDRpUnt.png - This caused some backlash, mostly due to how many female content creators consider the term ""e-girl"" to be offensive and disrespectful. After receiving this backlash, Boogie made a tweet stating he now understood why e-girl was an offensive term and was ""genuinely sorry"" for ever using it: https://i.imgur.com/4cNswnl.png - On that same day, in a response tweet to some of the women Boogie tagged in his original tweet, he promised he was deleting e-girl from his vocabulary, vowing to never use the term again: https://i.imgur.com/X3BCIEG.png - Not even a year later on January 2nd 2020, Boogie posted a video guide on ""how to be an e-girl"" to his Youtube channel. https://i.imgur.com/uudAWtu.png - After Boogie once again started to receive criticism for his use of the term ""e-girl"" in his new video, he quickly changed both the title and thumbnail. When fans in the comments noticed the change Boogie lied and claimed he had no idea e-girl was derogatory or offensive despite previously learning all this in March of 2019: https://i.imgur.com/GtPS9Z0.png and https://i.imgur.com/WZaglUe.png - When a twitter user asked Boogie to explain this contradiction, Boogie blocked him immediately then sent him a DM claiming he had ""forgot"" e-girl was a negative term: https://i.imgur.com/artAPbB.png #**Boogie lies about being swatted and tries to blame this subreddit** - In December 2019 Boogie began making very serious accusations towards this subreddit by claiming that this subreddit had ""swatted"" him a total of twice in that month: https://i.imgur.com/QfqyAkj.jpg - After going through all of the moderation logs for the month of December no evidence was found to support these claims. When asked for evidence on his end, Boogie's story started to change with him now claiming he didn't know who in particular had swatted him while still insisting that it happened. https://i.imgur.com/wkZri3a.png - However, Fayetteville Police Department's public dispatch logs revealed that no officers were sent to Boogie's place of residence in the entire month of December. When presented with this information, Boogie claimed that he had made an arrangement with the Fayetteville Police Department to purge the dispatch records after a welfare check in July of 2019. https://i.redd.it/79yujsxla7c41.jpg - This was quickly proven to be untrue as the Fayetteville Police had dispatch logs of a welfare check in November 2019, nearly 4 months after Boogie had claimed they stopped keeping records. When told this information, Boogie responded by blaming the Fayetteville Police claiming it must have been a mistake of their end: https://i.imgur.com/QPVGwGc.png - Boogie went on to say that the Fayetteville Police Department gave him not one but ""many"" [undocumented visits in the year of 2019](https://i.imgur.com/mkCwY5t.png), which he claimed was why their official records contradicted his claims. - Boogie also told a twitter user in a private message that he had made an ""agreement"" with Fayetteville Police Department to stop recording their visits to him: https://i.redd.it/k3hwi87e6ac41.jpg - Boogie said this despite the fact that Arkansas state legislation makes it mandatory for the police department to keep a record each and every time an officer is dispatched for whatever reason: https://i.redd.it/vvyzxr67q9c41.png - In addition, Fayetteville Police have confirmed via email that under no circumstances do they ever omit dispatch calls from their public records: https://i.imgur.com/w1xGQ70.png - When faced with this mountain of evidence against him, Boogie finally admitted to lying about the whole thing. Claiming that he intentionally falsely accused his critics of committing a federal crime and the Fayetteville Police Department of violating state record keeping laws for his own amusement and to make his critics look bad: https://i.imgur.com/duCNg7C.jpg - When faced with backlash for lying about his critics swatting him, Boogie said in a private message to a critic on twitter that he is willing to risk going to jail to make his critics look bad because he has nothing left to lose: https://imgur.com/G6QBs83 - In response to backlash from even his own fans on Youtube Boogie stated that he was glad he lied about swatting is willing to keep lying if it makes his critics look bad: https://i.imgur.com/HXB7Bb6.png #**Boogie lies about being hacked and tries to blame this subreddit** - Less than 24 hours after admitting to lying about being swatted, Boogie's twitter profile name was changed to ""."" and his profile/banner pictures were removed: https://i.redd.it/7xqxzxesblc41.png - Shortly after the bizarre profile change, Boogie posted from his alternate twitter account [claiming he was hacked](https://i.redd.it/i3s20ovtgmc41.jpg) and immediately blamed this subreddit: https://old.reddit.com/r/SamandTolki/comments/et1gov/boogie_just_posted_this_to_tiktok_about_the/ - Given the convenient timing as well as the fact that he had just admitted to a similar lie, many were skeptical of his story. Additionally, the hacker didn't seem to be doing anything with Boogie's account other than changing the name and profile picture as well as deleting a few embarrassing tweets made by Boogie himself. In response to people's skepticism, Boogie claimed this subreddit was framing him to make it look like he faked being hacked: https://i.redd.it/sxnhpsk2goc41.jpg - The very next day Boogie got his account back and made a tweet claiming that the hacker used the streaming app ""Mobcrush"" to hack into his twitter account. Boogie also posted all of his recent twitter log ins which showed 5 log ins from his normal IP and one from Mobcrush: https://i.imgur.com/gDV3AFa.png - In reponse to Boogie's explanation, Mobrush made an official statement on twitter stating that it was impossible for a hacker to gain access to a user's twitter account in the manner Boogie was describing and that the IP Boogie had posted was from their own AWS servers, proving that Boogie had lied about being hacked via their app: https://preview.redd.it/wdwqtcfot0d41.png?width=588&format=png&auto=webp&s=975811ffd5fcccc2a73dab977a555c48ce8742bc - Boogie responded to this in a tweet claiming he now had ""no clue"" how he got hacked while still denying any possiblity that he had lied, urging people to ""use their brains"" and believe his word over the all other evidence: https://i.redd.it/dp2b3j1bn2d41.jpg #**Boogie and manipulation** - One of the most common criticisms towards Boogie is that he has a tendency to be manipulative. This is a criticism that Boogie vehemently denies, calling it a ""falsehood"" which is ""unfair and untrue"" and blocking anyone who even mentions it: https://i.imgur.com/vRkPYdW.png - Additionally, in a (now deleted) Youtube video Boogie rejected any notion that he could possibly be a manipulative person. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBTmL6fKwIA&feature=youtu.be&t=1670 - However, a video posted by Boogie in 2012 following an argument with a friend was recently rediscovered. In this video Boogie confesses that he struggles with being manipulative due to the skill set he learned through childhood and most of his adulthood. Below are direct quotes from the video with timestamps. > [""As many of you know I came from an abusive home, and the skill set I was originally given was poison. I learned not how to negotiate but to manipulate""](https://youtu.be/AtBZyeSiat0?t=77) > [""When it comes to some serious deep important stuff, my skill set still relies on manipulation, and anger, and frustration. I think we all rely on that, maybe that's why I haven't learned a good skill set for that particular challenge because there isn't really a good skill set. I think everybody has to get a little angry to stand up for themselves, I think everybody has to get a little manipulative to get what they want.""](https://youtu.be/AtBZyeSiat0?t=208) > [""Today was one of those days, today I had a conversation with a friend and I said manipulative hate filled angry things. And hopefully it didn't cost me my friendship with that person""](https://youtu.be/AtBZyeSiat0?t=250) #**Boogie's inconsistent car accident story:** The following is a summary of a car accident Boogie was involved in and the aftermath. This section is not about concluding what did or didn't happen at the time of the accident, only to showcase how the details of Boogie's story frequently changed before leaving the decision up to the reader. - On November 24th 2019 Boogie announced on Twitter that he was involved in a traffic accident. He described the accident as a ""big pileup"" caused by a semi truck driver having a stroke. https://imgur.com/2bQUmtm - Questions began to arise shortly after as there were no news reports, tweets, or police scanners mentioning anything about a large pileup involving a semi truck. Meanwhile Boogie had posted a video of himself using his phone while driving mere hours before the accident: https://i.redd.it/7u7rc1gren041.png - The video of himself driving while on his phone caused many people to speculate if Boogie himself had caused the accident by being distracted while on his phone. That's when the details of his story began to change, starting with Boogie posting photos of the damage to his car while now claiming he had run the car into a ditch: https://i.imgur.com/NkW7aMG.png - A few days later Boogie posted [a video to his youtube channel](https://i.imgur.com/9K8onch.png), changing even more details about the accident. In the video Boogie claims the semi truck was miles ahead of him to the point where he couldn't even see it and only him and the car in front of him were in any confirmed accident, with Boogie rear ending them due to following too close. Which [he ended up getting a ticket for](https://i.redd.it/gnwt1bizpu041.jpg). Boogie dismissed the speculation of distracted driving by insisting that despite being on his phone hours prior, he wasn't on his phone during the time of the accident. - Boogie continued to defend himself by claiming he seldom used his phone while driving for anything except GPS, and that the day of [the accident was an exception](https://preview.redd.it/mbrmi5z96l041.jpg?width=588&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=191558cbb0865e0e3e569d6056cbb7d9d958a3ab). However, a Youtuber made a video in response this, compiling a nearly 8 minute long video of Boogie using his phone while driving all within the last few months: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0XtAB-L8qA - In a last ditch effort to prove that he was not driving while distracted, Boogie posted a picture of his traffic ticket to twitter. Analysis of the ticket revealed the Traffic code violation for a TN law called ""due care law"" which is used as (but not limited to) a punishment for distracted drivers: https://i.imgur.com/Yhj94IP.png #**Boogie confronts trans content creator ""Kat Blaque"" at Vidcon 2019** - On October 19th 2018 trans content creator Kat Blaque made a tweet criticizing Boogie for his opinion about the lack of importance of preferred pronouns in the trans community. https://i.imgur.com/6ZVdMJO.png - In July of 2019, Boogie confronted Kat in person at Vidcon. Kat describes the interaction as Boogie attempting to blame her for him wanting to kill himself. Kat goes on to describe how she felt ""cornered"" by Boogie and mentions that the confrontation upset her greatly as it reminded her of abuse she had previously endured: https://i.imgur.com/Y6RTcQ5.png - Shortly after Kat shared her story on twitter. Boogie made a few tweets in response confirming that the confrontation did happen, and proceeding to accuse Kat of making it all about her and shaming her for talking about it publicly: https://i.imgur.com/3ilJsNN.png #**Boogie shares a private email sent to him by fellow youtuber Apollo Legend while cropping most of the email and misrepresenting what the email was about.** - Boogie often claims that he is frequently being sent harassing emails from ""haters"" which do nothing but attack him. In response to people asking for evidence of these emails, Boogie shared a single heavily cropped email from fellow youtuber ""Apollo Legend"" in which the only the first sentence of the email was visible: https://i.redd.it/z6ut0f2xu3141.png - Apollo Legend himself responded to this tweet by providing the full email which clearly showed he was simply asking Boogie for explanations in a calm and rational manner. https://i.redd.it/k2nqtksnr6141.png - Upon finding out Apollo Legend was the one who sent the email, Boogie said Apollo was stupid for sending him the email at all: https://i.redd.it/9lp2c9yblb141.png - After being exposed and receiving backlash from even his own fans, Boogie was forced to apologize to Apollo: https://i.imgur.com/bFnqGUr.png #**Boogie lies and blames his own racist comments on his chat:** - Years ago Boogie made racist comments on stream about the income of people of color: https://streamable.com/9zld1 - Years later in August 2019 when the clip resurfaced and began to gain traction on twitter, Boogie blamed his chat for making the statement. Claiming that he was simply rebutting it: https://i.imgur.com/Nhy3o3g.png - However, he had previously [admitted it was a joke he made himself](https://i.imgur.com/Q43F4By.png) and further analysis of the clip, stream delay, and typing speed proved it would have been literally impossible for his chat to write a comment in response to the donation comment and have him read it aloud all within 6 seconds. https://old.reddit.com/r/SamandTolki/comments/cogm8u/analyzing_boogies_racist_comment_excuse/ - When confronted about this and the evidence against his claims that it was his chat who made the comment, Boogie blamed his memory: https://i.imgur.com/TKcRzZN.png #**Controversial behavior following the death of an acquaintance** - On December 14th 2019, a friend of Boogie passed away. https://i.imgur.com/7Wfvjgx.png - Upon hearing this information, Boogie began to tweet about his relationship with his friend. However, many people felt Boogie was focusing too much on himself, and using his friend's death as an opportunity to remind everyone of his own hardships and accomplishments while describing his late friend as his ""cheerleader"". https://i.redd.it/01dcv8oks3541.jpg - A few days later Boogie started mentioning his friend's death while posting several links to his newest unrelated travel channel video of Disneyland, encouraging people to give it views in honor of his friend. https://i.redd.it/90ishoobh9541.png - Both critics and fans alike responded negatively to these tweets, as they felt like Boogie was using his friend's very recent passing as a way to promote his new and struggling travel channel. Boogie responded to this criticism by stating it was okay for him to use his friend's death for views because he knew him intimately and he would have been glad he did it. https://i.redd.it/5xbsbwdw1a541.jpg - A short while later Boogie deleted all the tweets mentioning his friend while linking to his new video as well as his response to the resulting criticism. #**Dog biting controversy:** - Controversy arose on January 14th 2020 during a livestream when Boogie bit his Dog ""Sammy"" as part of a joke on stream. After the bite caused Sammy to flinch, Boogie could be heard saying ""Did I hurt you?"" and ""Did I startle you?"" while trying to console Sammy: https://streamable.com/tjhag - Many people considered this both careless and abusive treatment of his dog. Boogie responded by saying anyone upset by his treatment of his dog was lying and insisting that his dog ""felt no pain"" during the bite despite the negative reaction: https://i.redd.it/3eea66sdmoa41.jpg - Boogie also posted a video clip to his Twitter asking his fans opinion on the dog biting. However this only seemed to make matters worse as this clip conveniently cut out most of the actual biting, leading many twitter users to point this out while posting the full clip: https://i.imgur.com/4wsN9Ua.png - When asked on reddit about why he posted a trimmed down version of the full clip, Boogie responded by claiming he didn't edit the clip at all and simply took it directly from the clips on his twitch page: https://i.imgur.com/s6R57Yh.png - However, this was proven to be a lie as the clip uploaded to twitter was only 9 seconds long while every clip currently on his twitch page of the biting was much longer, with the shortest clip being 14 seconds long. https://i.imgur.com/2OmrkYD.png #**Boogie fails his 2020 New Years resolution, blames the internet, and deletes the video** - On January 1st 2020 Boogie uploaded a New Years video to his Youtube channel, begging his audience to give him another chance while promising this time the change was real and he was a new person. https://i.imgur.com/9XV2sa6.png - In the video, Boogie made 4 resolutions and promises to his audience.

703,"Please, At Least Read The Last Few SentencesThis is a lot to read. So if you don't want to read it all, then please just read the last few sentences. You can even ignore the link. &#x200B; I don't know why I keep writing these. There must have been many who have reached out for help numerous times, having done everything right, putting up a good fight, only to submit to that dark desire. It's not as though people notice when a stranger stops crying out in pain. We expect people to *not* cry out in pain most of the time. That's just how things are normally. It's the chaotic pleas that catch our attention *because* its unexpected. Yet, how many people have the strength, or desire, to tend to those that are suffering? If you ignore someone in pain, you take no responsibility for them unless you're personally called on. We only actively tend to others if there is a reward, or a heightened sense of sympathy. &#x200B; I find it common for others to do just enough to keep you from committing suicide, but few do more than that. I don't think we should be babied, but it certainly feels like we get abandoned. It's common to feed a starving person until they are strong enough, tend to a broken body until they are strong enough, raise a small child until they are strong enough, or even nurture a dying animal until they are strong enough. But not the emotionally damaged. &#x200B; So why do I keep writing these? Desperation, probably. I know full well that, even under the banner of ""suicide watch"", most people come here squeezing out their last drops of hope over mounds of despair; taking that last gamble that maybe someone can save them. I'm sure there are a great number of them who never actually commit suicide, but what about those who did? How many messages are on this subreddit that serve as someone's last words? Will this be my final message to the world? Like I said; I don't think most of us commit suicide *just* to die. We die as a last resort to end our suffering. At the same time, I don't think any of us live just to live. We *want* goals, passions, a sense of belonging, self-worth, feelings of accomplishment. Yet we're told not to die because it's ""better"" to live. Even if that means living in misery. &#x200B; It's at this point that I realize I'm only writing for myself. I'd *like* it if someone heard my cry for help, but I'm just another drop in the ocean, aren't I? I dunno. &#x200B; I opened this with the intent on explaining why I feel suicidal. *My* [reason](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dyj1z0/ive_been_battling_depression_for_nineteen_years/). But I've been repeating myself as it is online and offline. &#x200B; If someone *is* reading this, then thank you for at least hearing me out. If someone is reading this; I'm scared. I'm scared that I won't be able to hold this off anymore. So I'll just imagine that I'm not alone. That maybe this message connects us. I'll just pretend that someone is reading this. So, just in case I can't hold on, I won't be alone in the end. Thank you.",
704,"MatPat’s Latest Theory (What If It’s Oil?)Initially, I was going to upload this post after waiting for the conclusion of GTLive‘s 1985 theory video, but I might have an idea of where he’s headed with it. Even if I’m wrong, here’s my train of thought: The Stitchwraith has “black tears” running down the front of his face, which MatPat suggested are streaks of oil leaking from Ennard’s machinery. He also talked about various children who went missing in 1985. Next, it was revealed in the bestsellers “The Fourth Closet” and “Into the Pit” — as well as in the logbook — that Charlotte and Michael were two of many dead patrons put back together using robot parts; albeit, they didn’t find out until sometime later. Tape Girl describes Jeremy Fitzgerald as having black fluid on his shirt. I started thinking.... What if it’s OIL? Consider again that he hallucinates golden bears that went out of service in 1983 — I.E., he was present for the Bite of 83, and someone William would want to get rid of. Fritz Smith, another victim with a burial plot beside Jeremy’s and in front of Charlie’s, is a protagonist in the second game on the seventh night who experiences Golden Freddy jump scares. (This isn’t a coincidence anymore.) Jeremy is also rumored to have been a Bite victim, but if that were the case, he clearly survived the incident. What if he survived because he was put back together? What if what happened to Mike and Charlie also happened to Jeremy and Fritz? To a degree, it makes sense. Perhaps that’s how he was able to swiftly exit the VR facility with critical injuries (provided he wasn’t killing someone else). What it doesn’t explain is why Michael doesn’t have his own designated headstone — but I don’t think William ever intended for Michael to find out what sort of experiments he’d been conducting when his brother was killed in 1983. This would clear up some of the confusion surrounding Jeremy’s fate: was he the security guard who wound up a Bite victim, a missing child whose death was commemorated on a hilltop, or a has-been designer with a secret agenda? Here’s my take: Jeremy is part android, like his friends Michael and Fritz. That’s how the company gets away with hiring people for dangerous jobs with low salaries: “You won’t die.” -Baby, Sister Location You must admit, there are a LOT of ties between Sister Location, FNAF2, and Help Wanted. -Revisit the video MatPat posted on the VRHW teasers before the release of the game in which the two technicians who committed suicide in Sister Location are discussing an accident involving Jeremy. -Consider that the only time a Sister Location is referenced in the game is when Phone Guy is speaking to Jeremy Fitzgerald in FNAF2. -Tape Girl knew there “had to be a lawsuit.” Previous employees are not allowed on the property and Jeremy “used to do design work.” She reveals Jeremy will need to be “replaced soon.” Phone Guy claims “we don’t have a replacement for [Jeremy’s] shift yet, but we’re working on it.” -A prize counter is depicted on the right hand side, a unique feature only shared between FNAF2 and VRHW. -Jeremy is warned about glitches that exist in the system in FNAF2. Presumably as a result, he misses a memo — and Tape Girl happens to be creating a paper trail for someone’s firing. -Furthermore, Jeremy was present for —and took part in— the Bite of 83 animated in FNAF4, another game with clear links to the Sister Location. Scott couldn’t have stressed this overlap any harder. CONFIRMED: VRHW’s Jeremy IS FNAF2’s Jeremy Fitzgerald. Sure, Scott’s pulled the “two characters with the same name” move a number of times, BUT... there’s too much evidence to work with this time. Here are highlights of what I’ve said up to this point: 1. Ennard is the Stitchwraith, leaking black fluid. He asks to be let in. 2. Suicidal technicians spoke of an accident in which someone was let in, warning one another to, “Remember Jeremy....” 3. When Ennard is let in, Michael Afton is scooped. Are you seeing the pattern, here? Problematically, FNAF2 takes place near the time of Jeremy’s shift in VRHW, and he was clearly around for it. The eighth game likely takes place during the span of time in which court cases were being compiled after the disaster in 1985. Sister Location, on the other hand, occurs further down the line than anyone initially predicted (except for me, but nobody listened): at the same time as FNAF1, when the events from FNAF2 were being investigated by a former HR director who got himself fired for failure to properly resolve a crisis. Frankly, that’s annoying, because if that is the case, it falls more in line with the theory of Phone Guy’s death taking place on the fourth night of Sister Location, but... OH WELL. 🤫 If we assume there are, in fact, two employees talking to one another about Jeremy and Tape Girl is documenting his appearances, as Matt asserted, it can be concluded that Jeremy was NOT ruthlessly killed in the Bite of 87 or whatever scooping incident or cultish shenanigans really took place that year at JR’s. But the fanbase doesn’t want to let up on the idea that it’s someone else, and the signs seem to point to Jeremy. Both must be true, right? Jeremy was bitten but survived and continued to function normally in life with a prefrontal lobotomy, right? That must be the end of this argum— WRONG. Jeremy complained of NIGHTMARES to a higher up in VRHW and is even described as being noncompliant with management. Removing a prefrontal lobe makes a person COMPLACENT. Jeremy was at odds with his superiors. Personally, I think the Bite of 87 was a hoax that never actually occurred in the first place. I understand why Jeremy is deemed a victim in 87 by most of the fanbase... but I can concede it’s only possible at most. For one thing, nobody supplies six training tapes to someone working a five day shift, so the validity of the date of the Bite of 87 is in the air itself. BUT, if I were to argue that it happened, I’d wager that’s only half of the truth. Unless Jeremy’s brain was somehow repaired, he would have been unable to function in the way Tape Girl is purporting he did. If he is the Bite victim AND the beta tester from VRHW, his severed brain part has been tampered with. You simply can’t say the following four things in one sentence about the same person: 1. A man survived a traumatic removal of a prefrontal lobe and continued to function. 2. He complained of nightmares to his higher ups at a gaming company several years later. 3. After a meeting with management, he stopped jumping at an anomaly that frightened him. Nothing scares him anymore. This shift from experiencing fright to being completely oblivious to it would hint that something intense happened in Dale’s office to make Jeremy compliant. He didn’t barrel-charge his way back to his workstation with renewed vigor and strength after a comforting discussion. “It didn’t look like he was given much sympathy.” -Tape Girl. Sure, given the company was at war with the Indie game developers they’d hired, perhaps they exercised some sort of leverage over him or threatened to dock his pay, but is that the most realistic explanation given that Tape Girl thought the change was extreme enough to document? ...Not really. If he’s an android, on the other hand, it stands to reason Jeremy can be rebooted in a matter of seconds. It would explain why he goes from being a basket case to suddenly at ease in the time span of an hour. (I don’t know about you guys, but my office meetings don’t last longer than the average lunch break.) If that’s too much of a stretch for you, then we’ll assume he was simply made aware that he was part robot during his meeting with Dale. In that case, he would no longer have something to BE afraid of. This is congruent with the true meaning behind Baby’s promise to her brother: “You [essentially can’t] die.” I disagree with this theory, however, because based on what we know about Jeremy, he runs his mouth a lot. He’d be the first person to dash on to the scene, missed memo during a crisis in hand, and proclaim he’s a robot, so everyone would be made aware of how screwed up the corporation is. A third possibility for those of you who are still skeptical is that management has the power to operate and activate Glitchtrap, but for that to be the case, management would have to be conspiring with the client — wait a second... “Fazbear Entertainment hired the Indie game developer.” -Tape Girl Well, that neatly ties up all the loose ends. Jeremy must be the Indie developer. Let’s call it a day! ...I’m kidding (again). Yes, this game COULD make a strong case for Jeremy being the Indie developer Tape Girl references, but in that case, he’d want to keep his mouth shut to claim his portion of the profit. So, that’s out, in my book. MatPat made a more compelling argument for Oswald fulfilling this role. Moreover, Jeremy was linked to the paper cutter and supply closet based on his previous job description, which would point to a career in mechanical drawing. Let’s also examine the phrase “beta tester” — you know, Jeremy’s other job. (Fitzgerald is a complex man who hasn’t decided what he ultimately intends to do with his life, but damn it all if doesn’t involve Fazbear fucking Entertainment, for some reason.) Jeremy was beta testing not only for a virtual reality game, but to assess the potential of a robot to KILL. In and of himself, Jeremy could be a safety measure. Even if you don’t believe phrases like “beta testing” and “development team” can refer to developmental phases of virtually any given experiment... there are too many parallels between the shifts worked by Jeremy, Fritz, and Mike. Hell, they’re the only three characters to be called out by name on a dated check. That puts them in a league all their own. I propose it’s a similar one. While there are any number of things that could have transpired during his meeting with Dale, we can agree that Jeremy walked into the manager’s office looking pale and sickly, then left a changed man. To me, the idea of a reboot makes the most sense. And let’s be honest: there’s hardly a need to speculate about exactly Jeremy saw that triggered management to push back. For crying out loud, this character shows up to restricted areas more often than Michael Afton, and Mike was the protagonist of twice as many installments. All we can really conclude about the events that took place in the hallway that night are that Tape Girl encountered Jeremy at work in the dark, and rather than turning on a light to clarify the situation, she complained about how dark it was and got the hell out of dodge (that is, she wasn’t about to stop and have conversation or ask her coworker if he needed an Advil tablet). She does seem concerned that he’s there, but at the same time, she expects him to be. That’s because her job is to report his activities to management, but don’t forget: management wants to tell a version of the story that makes Jeremy look like a complete lunatic. Context is important and she went out of her way to omit it. Because nobody goes out of their way in the middle of the night to show up at work to confront the nightmares they experience while they’re awake. You want someone to sound like a total nut job? Document them breaking all the rules and exhibiting behaviors that make people uncomfortable. Tape Girl didn’t just happen to stumble upon him. She identifies him using the sounds of shuffling feet as her lead. -_o... Unless this dude is wearing TAP SHOES, she would not have been able to make that distinction without knowing Jeremy was present already. What, this woman makes a habit of tiptoeing down the hallway in the dark to report back that other people are following the same trend? “I love showing up to work early and making a big deal about Jeremy doing it.” No, that’s unrealistic. She didn’t want to be spotted because she was assigned the task of following him. I previously proposed Jeremy was sneaking in to examine pictures of the Bite of 83, since William designed the original animatronics with the intent of turning them into remnant test subjects. As a designer, Jeremy knew the ins and outs of the robots and facial recognition software. I still maintain that he was a perpetrator in 83 and has a mounting desire to expose Fazbear Entertainment for what it is — BUT, I don’t think it would have bode well for William to keep film reels of evidence that could lead to his conviction just casually sitting in a darkroom. These were pictures that were recently developed. Jeremy was hanging developing photos of Glitchtrap to discredit the company’s claims. He was using the paper cutter to cut and hang them when he was ambushed by another employee, and a physical altercation occurred. This resulted in Jeremy being doused in thick, black liquid. If it were due to removal of his face, Tape Girl would have seen the substance leaking out from underneath the visor. She didn’t — not even when he turned to look directly at Tape Girl. Guys, if she could make a determination as to whether or not he appeared to be staring at her, she would have made a remark about some sticky film on his face. This man wasn’t prone to self-harm... he was just damaged in an attempt to fight off someone who caught him stealing information. Maybe you have a special place in your heart for Jeremy Fitzgerald and just cannot bring yourself to accuse him of murder. Fine — Jeremy was standing on his lonesome when some heinous criminal tried to take him down with a paper cutter. Someone was severely injured and Jeremy and management both knew where the paper cutter was located — and that was NOT in the supply room where it initially started. My bet is he took photos of whatever he’d seen. That’s why he’s standing in a lackluster darkroom. ***The pictures had to be taken through the visor to capture the images seen on the headset.*** If the robots are seeing the protagonist as an Endoskeleton? There might be a reason... Could THIS be that reason? 🤔 After all, if you want to weed out viruses and glitches, it stands to reason that an android would be the best test subject. They can provide reliable feedback because they function like computers on some level, and would display obvious signs of infection if exposed to a glitch.",

This is a certain kind of case that has been requested quite frequently, so I hope it lives up to expectation. I worry that there will be some disagreement among readers regarding this client, but it makes for an interesting tale at the very least! I met with this woman about four months ago. When I first laid eyes on her, I immediately noticed a large, mangled scar that spread across one shoulder. Out of respect, I did not allow my gaze to linger on the area for long. She offered a small smile when I greeted her, but I observed a profound sadness behind her eyes. “Go ahead and take a seat on the couch over there,” I directed, waving to the area. “You can leave your things there as well.” The woman followed my request, falling backwards onto the sofa. I trailed after her and perched on my own chair directly across from her. “Ma’am, did you bring payment?” She nodded, rustling through a disorganized bag muddled with receipts and other miscellaneous items. The woman located a bundle of cash among its contents and leaned forward to pass it to me. I thanked her for the payment before continuing, “whenever you’re ready, ma’am, you may begin your story.” “This is going to sound crazy,” the woman warned, folding her hands in her lap. “But, I can smell death.” I cocked my head to one side, evaluating this assertion. “What do you mean?” The woman snickered at my reaction. “I mean exactly what I said. One morning when I was just a young child, I sensed a soft, sweet smell. The faint smell of vanilla, but with a burnt element to it. It grew in intensity over the following days, and I realized that the scent’s strength would magnify in the presence of my parents, and wane in their absence. It was the most pleasant smell… I would burrow my face in their necks when we hugged just to get more of it,” she reminisced fondly. “One evening, they left for a date and the scent had become overwhelming, developing into a sickly saccharine yet bitter aroma I can only liken to burning molasses.” “What happened that night?” I questioned, shifting in my seat. Her gaze dropped to the floor. “As they walked back to their car following their date, they were attacked. The police were never able to figure out exactly what happened, but they were both shot and killed that night.” “I’m so sorry, ma’am… that must have been awful for you,” I expressed, furrowing my brow in concern. She nodded solemnly. “It was. The smell dissipated after their death. From then on, I understood what it meant. The scent came back to me in the days before each of my grandparents passed, and it has cropped up before every other death I’ve experienced. I always know,” she breathed, “and it’s torture.” I crossed my legs and gestured for her to continue. “The smell resurfaced approximately a year ago, both startling and terrifying me when I discovered its source. It was wafting off of my husband and two young daughters,” she explained, shaking her head sluggishly in disbelief. “My husband didn’t know of my unfortunate ability, but I begged him hysterically to cancel the trip he was planning to take with our girls to visit his parents. I thought that was clearly the source of the danger.” “Did they stay home?” I inquired. A halfhearted smile spread across her features. “My husband was clearly confused and concerned, but he did as I asked. I had never attempted to interfere with the development of the smell, the natural course of events… but it worked. As I flicked on the television the following morning, I was alarmed to see a news segment detailing a major car accident on the very route my family would have taken. My family came downstairs moments later, and thank god… the scent was gone,” the woman declared. I lifted one eyebrow quizzically. “Something tells me that’s not the end of your tale.” “Smart girl,” she muttered, tucking a strand of raven hair behind one ear. “Sure, the smell was gone… but it came back. Again and again, no matter what measures I took to stop it. Each time I thought it’d subsided for good… it would just come back again a day or so later. An uncontrollable sense of dread and paranoia overtook me entirely. My husband was a stay at home parent, and I pleaded with him to remain indoors with the girls at all times… to keep them safe. Eventually, I enforced this as a rule, essentially locking them away. I couldn’t… I couldn’t stand to see them hurt, or worse,” she ranted, tears beginning to form in her dark eyes. “Did it work?” I asked cautiously, although I already knew the answer. “No, it didn’t. They’re all dead, now,” the woman replied with an exaggerated sigh. She dropped her head and cried for a few minutes. I brought one of my hands to my face, one curled finger obstructing my mouth as she sobbed. “The details are fuzzy… PTSD, my therapist says. The smell had taken on that burning molasses quality. Naturally, I panicked and rushed to find my family. I came upon my husband in the bathroom, finishing the girls’ bath. It took me a moment to fully comprehend what I was seeing. My girls, they laid dead in the tub, drowned. I screeched, what have you done, how could you do this? I pulled one of my girls from the basin, but I knew they were gone as soon as my hands hit the water… it was cold,” she divulged with an audible shiver, as if her hands were still submerged in the frigid water. “Nevertheless, I tried to revive her. I attempted CPR… the sound of her sternum cracking was horrific.” Tears continued to flow freely from her eyes. I didn’t know what to say. There wasn’t really anything appropriate to say. “I… I’m so sorry, ma’am.” She dismissed my words with the wave of a hand. “I didn’t even realize my husband had left the room until he returned with the gun. He aimed and shot… I fell backwards. And then he stuffed the muzzle of the gun in his mouth and fired,” she continued, sniffling. “Unfortunately, I survived. The bullet lodged in my shoulder. When police arrived on the scene, they found my girls and husband dead, and he was soaked in water.” She gestured to the massive scar that spread across the proximal end of her left upper arm. “Physically, I recovered quite well, although I have lost a lot of strength and sensation in this arm. Emotionally, well, that’s a different story. I was left wondering if it had simply been their fate to pass that day and intervening only postponed it, or if maybe I had driven my husband mad with my behavior.” “You mentioned a therapist?” I recalled. “Yes, I was diagnosed with PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder soon after. I began to suffer from agonizing flashbacks, particularly in that bathroom. This eventually developed into a severe phobia of the bathtub,” she revealed, picking at a fingernail. She wiped the tears from her eyes with a crumpled tissue from her purse. “I worked with my therapist extensively on cultivating coping mechanisms, and eventually exposure therapy to tackle this strange phobia.” She paused momentarily before clarifying, “that is, introducing myself to the fear-inducing stimulus – the bathtub – in baby steps. We started just by talking about it, then looking at pictures, finally leading up to actually bathing in it like I used to enjoy so much.” I leaned forward as I asked, “oh? And how did that go?” A second cascade of tears started to drip down her face. “I was able to use the techniques I had built with my therapist… I felt a deep sadness, but I also felt close to my girls, if that makes sense. It went well until I slipped underwater to rinse my hair at the conclusion of my bath like always. I felt the water swallow me whole, and I let myself just lie there for a moment, feeling calm for the first time since the traumatic event,” she remarked, discarding her soiled tissue into her purse before retrieving a new one. “When I tried to surface, an unknown force held me underneath. My eyes shot open, and I saw the most… *horrifying* thing.” “What was it?” I urged. “It… it was me,” she sniveled, meeting my gaze. “I saw myself with arms outstretched to prevent me from surfacing, eyes widened in a dead stare. I thought I was going to drown, but as I began to lose consciousness, she… or guess *I* let go,” the woman recounted. “I burst out of the water, hacking and couching. The water in the tub immediately ran cold. I discovered, to my horror, that I was not alone in there. The decaying, bloated corpses of my daughters were floating alongside me,” she choked through tears. “They were practically crumbling, some of their limbs already detached and bobbing atop the chilled water, mixing with liquified fat… their eyes had disintegrated entirely, running and dripping out of the sockets. The sticky sweet smell of burnt molasses assaulted my nostrils.” My stomach dropped. I felt like I was going to be sick. The woman blew her nose and composed herself enough to continue, although still weeping heavily. “From there, the flashback played out almost like a movie before my eyes, vividly animated unlike they’d ever been previously. I observed ‘other me’ exit the room calmly, calling down the stairway, look what I’ve done, honey,” she explained with the last bit in a disturbing sing-song voice. “After that, I heard someone barrel up the stairs… the heavy steps of my husband,” the woman whimpered, holding her hands in fists so tight that her nails dug into her palms. “My husband, he… he burst through the door, and the look on his face… those girls. They were his entire world, and they were gone.” It was almost impossible for me to maintain my own composure, but I reminded myself to remain professional. “I can’t even imagine what you’ve been through, ma’am,” I reassured, my voice wavering slightly. “He immediately fell to his knees and held the girls to his chest in the tub, embracing them one last time… their putrefying corpses sputtered and oozed various gasses and liquids of decay. I vomited into the tub, but my husband paid me no mind,” she muttered, releasing one fist to support her forehead with the space between an outstretched thumb and index finger. “And that’s when everything started to look familiar.” I gritted my teeth against the tears I suspected might come. “What looked familiar?” She emitted an indignant laugh. “The flashbacks I’d had previously, they weren’t *wrong*, they were just… delayed. I watched other me erupt through the door, the moment of realization as sheer terror passed over her face, the grief-stricken shrieking. What have you done, she howled, as she yanked one of the corpses out of the basin… she attempted to perform CPR, but I’d - the real me - had already broken her sternum on that fateful day, and my girl’s body was softened with rot. Her hands… they just sunk right through, then reemerged coated in brackish muck,” she lamented, eyes inflamed and reddened. ""Little did she know - I know... she'd done it all along. I’d done it all along.” Her voice was barely more than a whisper. I let out a long breath, bracing myself for the rest of her tale. “This time, I did notice my husband exit the room, returning with our gun. The gun we bought to protect ourselves, our family. I studied the scene as he pointed the weapon at me… first directly at my chest, then off to the side,” she remarked with a tearful sigh. “It was then that I realized, he didn’t want to kill me. He wanted to *hurt* me, he wanted me to live with this. He wanted me to know what I’d done,” the woman sobbed, pulling the neck of her top up to wipe her tears. “I feel so absurd for having ever thought otherwise. My husband, a family annihilator? No, it doesn’t make sense. Our girls were everything to him. To me, too… but he lived for them, and only them.” I already knew the answer, but I asked anyway. “Why are you here today?” The woman laughed in spite of herself through her weeping. “Because, I killed my babies. Destroyed my husband. I want you to know that I had no inkling that I had hurt them until now, and I can’t stand to live a moment longer knowing what I’ve done. I don’t deserve to live, either,” she explained. She paused briefly, then firmed her tone to add, “Miss, I don’t want you to think that I’m trying to evade responsibility entirely. I’ve written a note confessing to the wretched thing I’ve done. It’s in my bag. Please leave it with my body. You have to believe me. I didn’t know what I was doing,” she implored, lacing her hands together tightly and holding them over her reddened face. Weighing my options, I nodded slowly. “I believe you. I’ll help you.” “Thank you,” she sighed through tears. “I knew you would help me since the moment I entered this place and picked up on that slight sweet scent of vanilla. The scent has only been growing throughout our talk. It’s overwhelming now… and for the first time since I was a little girl, I’m happy that it’s here.” “Please lie down, ma’am. I’m going to prepare the injection,” I instructed as I sprung out of my chair to do just that. I have been asked to write about a case involving an ethical grey area, and this is certainly one of them. The answer here was not clear cut, leaving me to rely more on intuition. I understand that not all of you will agree with my judgment with this client - after all, she killed her children - but you were not there listening to her story. You could not sense her grief, her confusion, her guilt. Growing up autistic, I’ve had to study the behavior of other people in order to understand their intentions. Years of doing this has given me a sort of hyperawareness of any change in tone or body language and what these changes might mean. However, her last words were truly what solidified the validity of the decision in my mind. “Please, miss... you make damn sure they cremate me,” she cried as I steadied the needle against her skin. “I deserve to [go to hell](https://www.reddit.com/r/hercreation/).” [I](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dyeb0f/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [II](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dzjr8q/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [III](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/e01n9m/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [IV](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/e12izn/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [V](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/e4t824/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [VI](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/e5uzer/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [VII](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/e7ptwn/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [VIII](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/eb6dot/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [IX](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ebpjoc/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [X](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/eeyl14/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [XI](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ehfp7c/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | XII | [XIII](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/eo5az5/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [XIV](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/et4gqa/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [XV](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/evo0y5/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/)",
706,"I Hit A Little Boy With My Truck I just didn’t see him. I don’t know why, I just didn’t. I was driving my pick-up truck down a dirt road. It was very dark out, and specks of dust hung in the air like a thick cloud when my headlights shined on them. Country music blared over the radio. I wasn’t really listening to it that much. I was driving back from the bar and was headed home to my family. Maybe I was drunk, maybe I wasn’t I don’t know. All I know is that suddenly my peaceful trip ended when a kid, couldn’t have been older than five, connected with the front end of my truck and then skidded across the road. I sat in my truck, stunned. My mind couldn’t quite process what had just happened at first. Then it slowly started to sink it. A horrid feeling of sickened remorse flew through me. My stomach hurt, and I felt nauseas. I jumped out of my truck and ran to the boy. He was clearly dead. He had on a shirt with blue stripes running across it and some black shorts. All of it was stained with blood. The poor kids’ body had caved inwards, revealing a shattered rib cage, and a few glimpses of his insides. And the look of shocked agony was still held on the boys’ face. I could only stand there, staring down at this boy, who but a moment ago, had just been playing like any other kids his age. And now his life had been cut short, never to progress beyond that stage of innocent playfulness. I stayed there for what felt like an eternity of misery, before getting back in my truck, and driving home. Its funny how an event like that could cloud your experience. The rest of that night proceeded just like all my nights other go. I got home, my wife, Donna greeted me, I hung out with my daughter, Mackenzie, for a little bit, and I did some housework. In fact, it seemed wrong that everything should be so normal. I felt like something should be different, but it was all the same as usual. The boys’ death colored my experience in a dark way. I felt disgusting. Like some horridly deformed animal that didn’t even deserve attention, or happiness. I was a child murder. I wanted to die. That was all I desired. I spent that night waiting for the police to arrive, even though I knew they probably wouldn’t. there was, after all, no reason to suspect I had done anything. That night I dreamt of the accident, over and over again. I would hit the child with my truck, watch him get projected into the other direction, and then it would repeat. All the while I felt mounting horror and guilt at what I was. But the last hit was different. As I watched for the two dozenth time, the child skidded across the rough asphalt road. Blood streaking the ground. But then, he moved. It was very subtle. A slight move of his shoulder, but he definitely moved. No doubt about it. After that I fell into deeper sleep without a single more dream. The next day I saw the child on the news. Or rather, pictures of him as he had once been. His name was Lenny Drover. A happy and vibrant kid. A member of his schools’ little league baseball team. I saw a video of his mother and father crying. They tried to interview her, but you couldn’t understand her though the sobs. The father had said that all he wanted now was for his son to be with God and for whoever did this to pay. I almost agreed with him. I looked around at all that I had and realized I didn’t deserve any of it. Due to my negligence that boy was dead, and I was going to get away with it, which almost made me feel worse. My daughter was in the room with me. She wasn’t paying attention to the news. She was just playing with her dolls on the floor. I stared at her for a few moments with a sense of emptiness within me. Then I heard foot-steps, coming from down the hallway. I turned to see who it was but no one was there. I turned back around and continued watching the news. A few minutes passed, and then I heard it again. Footsteps. I looked back but again, no one was there. I looked to my daughter but she didn’t seem to notice it. I got up and walked down the hall-way. Nothing seemed out of place. I gazed, in the dim light, at my family pictures and at the little table we had up against the wall. That was when I noticed that the potted plant we had was knocked over, spilling its contents onto the ground. “Oh, you’ve got to be kidding me,” I said. I went and got the broom and the dust-pan, and I cleaned up the little mess. But I felt a lingering sense of dread within me. Try as I might, I couldn’t explain the footsteps. That being said though, I still viewed it as being too minor to really share with anybody. A week went by, with no other strange occurrences. Over the course of that week I had done some serious soul searching. I had begun the healing process of thinking that perhaps I wasn’t really a bad person. Just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Of course, it had only been a week, I hadn’t really gotten over it, but the deep, profound self-hatred and remorse had subsided slightly. That was until I was walking past that hallway, in my living room, when I noticed out of the corner of my eye that something was wrong. Or, to be honest, it wasn’t that I saw something, it’s more like I felt something. I could see a shadow, coming out of the hall bathroom. It didn’t really resemble anything; it was just something blocking the light. I told myself, rationally, that my wife had probably just moved a box in there or something. But it was more than just the shadow. It was the feeling that it brought with it. The feeling that it saw me. But not just visually. I felt like it was looking at me, and then through me, sifting through the dark recesses of my mind to find that one event which cast a darkness on my psyche. I wanted to run, but I couldn’t, because I felt it beckon me. And then my wife slammed the front door. It jolted me awake from my state and I looked away from the hall. Then I looked back, and the shadow was gone. “Honey! I was just at the store, I bought those razors you said you needed,” Said my Wife. “Ok, tha….. thank you,” I stuttered out. I tried to push the memory of that shadow from my mind, but I just couldn’t. I must be crazy. I must be! The deranged hallucinations of a guilt-ridden paranoid mad-man. That must have been what that was. Unless……. I couldn’t sleep that night. Every single noise I heard, I treated with suspicion. From the air conditioning, to the ice in my refrigerator, to the beeps of the washer. I maybe got like two hours of sleep. The next day passed, and then the next, and then the next. The guilt had returned in full force. My wife had asked me repeatedly if something was wrong, and I would always just make up some bull-shit story. But deep down, I felt like I shouldn’t even exist. I was watching the news again one day, and they were once again talking about the boy. I watched intently on what was going on, and almost began crying. Then they flashed an image of the boy, smiling on the screen. Then something weird happened. The birds stopped chirping outside, and the car that was driving outside my window stopped. Then, the image of the boys’ smiling face began to slowly turn to a frown. My vision in my periphery turned dark, and I was stuck with tunnel vision on the boy with no way to look away. The boys’ frown then turned to a look of sadness, and then one of agony, as the boys’ face started to rot away. He started screaming. It was louder than anything I had ever heard in my life. It started at a normal volume, and then increased in magnitude with each passing moment. His skin turned purple, then black as it started to peel away, revealing his facial muscles. Blooded started pouring from the horrible remains of his face. And then, it just stopped. Things immediately went back to normal. The birds started chirping again and the cars started moving. By now the T.V. had moved onto something else. But I could never move on. I broke down into tears. Now my wife was incredibly concerned for me, but I dared not tell her what was bothering me. I wouldn’t be able to stand the look of horror on her face as I told her what I had done. I had replayed that thought in my head of me telling her how I ran over a child, and it never gave me a pleasant feeling. I would simply wake up, go to work, not talk to anyone while I was there, and then return home. While at home I would hardly speak. I would just watch T.V. or just hide in my room. I would keep all of the lights off, and just stare up at the ceiling fan. When my wife would come in to check on me, I would just tell her to leave me alone. She was always a very agreeable woman and always tried to shy away from confrontation, so she gave me my space. Someday I would tell her, I told myself, but not today. Today I will simply wallow in my own misery and self-hatred, and hope that this anguish would just go away. Some time had passed, when I realized that enough was enough. I couldn’t keep on like this. So, I decided to take my daughter to the park. I felt like it would be nice to go get some fresh air. She was very excited about the arrangement as well; she was practically jumping up and down with excitement. I think it also might have been because the two of us hadn’t had proper bonding time in quite a while on account of my miserable state. So, we hopped in the truck and went off to the park. The park was a great woodland that had been set aside by the city for recreational use. There was a fun area for kids, a river for fishing, and a field that kids played sports in. My daughter ran around inside of the fun area with a bunch of other kids, going on the slide, swinging, and all around just enjoying themselves. Much like the boy had been. I sat on a bench, just trying to relax. There were a few other parents around me, and I spoke to one of them for a few minutes. I was enjoying myself, until I heard a group of parents talking about the boy. “They say you couldn’t even recognize him. Its been so long and they haven’t been able to find who did it. I say it’s a failure of the police. They ought to be doing more to catch that bastard,” Said one of them. “I know right. They deserve to pay for what they did,” Said another one. I tried to blot them out but I couldn’t. I looked away from where they were standing and covered my ears. I managed to block out all of the noise. After a few seconds I took my hands off of my ears. But there was still no noise. But the feeling from the shadow had returned. Like something could see into me. I looked out across the fun area, and standing behind the swings, was the boy. He was looking right at me. I stood up from the bench and looked right at him. Then, from behind a slide, the same boy appeared, and then another one appeared from next to the jungle gym. And then more, then more, then more! I called for my daughter and she ran towards me. She was confused and upset that we had to leave. She kept on begging me to let her stay. “Shut the fuck up right now!” I said to her. She looked at me with astonishment, and then started to quietly sob. The other parents were looking at us now. And the boys were too. In fact, they were laughing at me. I ran to my car with my daughter close behind, and we went right home. My wife tried to talk to me but I just ignored her. I ran to my room, shut the door, and tucked my head under the covers like a scared child. I stayed like that for a long time. Eventually, I told my wife she could come in and she tried to comfort me. But nothing she said helped. I couldn’t tell anymore what was going on. I felt like an astronaut that was lost in space, completely isolated from the world. I didn’t know what was real anymore. I thought that I was losing my mind. That the guilt and paranoia had rotten my mind and infected my soul. A just punishment for a child-killer I told myself. But then… perhaps I wasn’t crazy. Perhaps the spirit of that young boy was terrorizing me for the wrong I had committed against him. Or perhaps something darker. And that was when the feeling from the shadow returned. A feeling that someone was walking through my mind, reading me like a book. But also, the feeling that I was being summoned. Half by choice, and half by command, I got up from my bed, and followed the sense. It led me to that hallway. I looked out and I saw it again. The shadow in the door. The feeling became more potent, and as I approached, it grew in intensity. I came closer and closer to the light of the bathroom and the darkness of the shadow. I came to within a foot of the door. Then, I entered the room. Standing before me was what I can only describe as an emptiness. It would be a mistake to say that it appeared black, or like any color at all. It was simply a location where there was just nothing. A void. A cold, empty void. All of the walls were covered in blood, and I knew who’s blood they belonged to. In more places than I can count, the word, “GUILTY” had been drawn with the blood of that dead boy. On the bathroom floor, pieces of his dead body were scattered about. An arm here, a leg there, and an extraordinary number of other parts. I nearly vomited from the stench. My attention was soon stuck on the void though. It captured my gaze and I was unable to look away from it. The feeling of dread and anguish was unbearable at this point. Then, it spoke. “You know what you must do,” It said. But it said it in the voice of the boy. “I know,” I said. And just like that, my bathroom was spotless. The emptiness had gone, as did the body parts, and the blood. And just like that, something had left me as well. The sadness was gone. As was the guilt and the feeling of dread. In fact, I felt nothing. Absolutely nothing. But I knew what I had to do. So, I am going to commit suicide. I have my revolver in hand, with one bullet. There is nothing in this world left for me. I don’t know if I am motivated by the ghost of that kid, the command of a demon, or the motivations of madness, but it doesn’t really matter to me at this point. What’s the difference anyways between ghosts of the dead and the ghosts of the mind after all? A fitting end, for a child- murderer. Something tells me that boy is smiling right now.",

With the new year coming up, I’ve been reflecting a lot on myself, my actions, and who I want to be. While certainly not everyone will agree with what I do, I am comfortable right where I am. Moving forward, I am resolving to remain even more conscious of my own mental health so I do not end up in a situation similar to the client I am going to write about today. As a forewarning, this man's story involves pretty upsetting descriptions of violence, in some cases involving children. I met with this man around this time last year. He was likely in his fifties and appeared quite tall and strong. He had short cropped salt and pepper hair, looking somewhat “rough around the edges” in a dark leather jacket. As I opened my door, he greeted me with a sturdy – almost painful – handshake. I granted him entry to my residence by stepping aside and gesturing down the hallway to the living area. “Sir, please take a seat on the couch. I’ll join you momentarily,” I directed. The man moved ahead of me and located the sofa. He dropped down into the cushion with an exasperated sigh. I followed him soon after with my chair from the dining room table in tow. I positioned the chair to face him and settled in. “Thank you for having me,” the man stated gruffly. “I’m glad I found you. I’d heard rumors about you, I’m surprised to know you’re actually real.” I nodded in response. “Yes, I realize I can be hard to reach… but that’s just for my own safety. Before we begin, did you bring payment?” He passed me a small brown paper bag, the kind you would presume to find a bottle of liquor concealed within. I accepted the sack, opening it to quickly verify its contents. “I don’t want you to think that I’m an alcoholic or anything. I used to drink a lot, but I don’t anymore. It ruined my life,” he started with a long sigh. I crossed my legs and leaned forward, propping my head on one hand. “How so?” The man shook his head in long, slow motions, apparently pained by the memories. “When I was deep in the clutches of my addiction, I lost my daughter. I was too wasted to pick her up from school… in fact, I was so far gone I didn’t even realize it was a school day. My wife had left me by that point, so I was the only one looking out for her,” he muttered. “I failed at that completely. She was never found.” “Sir, I’m so sorry. No parent should ever have to go through the loss of their child,” I offered in reassurance, knowing it was not enough. “Well, it was my fault entirely. If I hadn’t been at that same goddamn bar every day, she would be alive,” he conceded. “The only positive thing that came out of that situation was that I cleaned up my act. I never returned to that wretched place again, and I actually became a private investigator. While I’ve never been able to locate my daughter, I have helped other families reunite with their own children,” the man explained as he reached into his pocket to retrieve his wallet, handing it to me. I grasped the wallet, unsure of his intentions. Upon unfolding the leather exterior, I noted several pictures of young children enclosed in small plastic sheaths. I flipped through each photograph before returning the item. The man smiled for the first time as he proudly explained, “those are all children I have brought home to their parents, many of them alive. Turns out I’m pretty good at my job.” The man scoffed at himself. “If only I hadn’t thrown away most of my life on the bottle before I figured that out.” “That’s incredible, sir,” I declared, tucking a loose strand of dark chestnut hair behind one ear. His smile faded almost instantly. “Yes, indeed it was.” He paused for a moment, thoughtfully running the pad of his thumb over the stubble that covered his chin. “I’ve been working the case of a missing young boy. I often get hired on missing persons cases because, in my opinion, the police do a shit job. They declare young kids to be runaways and then get this laser focus on one suspect regardless of what the evidence says. They don’t care about justice, they only want to close a case,” he ranted, tightening his fists. “I think I’m allowed to feel this way, as this is essentially what they did with my daughter.” I bobbed my head. “I can imagine I would feel the same way if I was in your situation.” “Thank you for that,” he responded, his voice softening. “I’ve been working this case for a few months, and I just got a promising tip a couple weeks ago. Through speaking with some of the boy’s neighbors – a job which the police *should* have done – I found that the kid had been seen with a local man the day he disappeared,” he stated. “When I looked into him and found his picture, the first thing I thought was… shit. I know that guy.” I raised one eyebrow in confusion. “How did you know him?” With his eyes locked on the ground, the man clarified, “I recognized him from the bar that I used to frequent. I actually spoke to him a few times. He would brag about his sexual exploits often. I thought he was a real jerk, but I never turned him away if he wanted to sit with me because he’d always buy me drinks. When I understood that this man could have been a child abductor, I just…” the man choked, tears forming in his eyes. “I just couldn’t stop wondering if perhaps those explicit tales he had recounted in my presence involved children.” I shook my head gently, allowing the man to feel whatever he needed before proceeding further. “Naturally, I knew I had to follow up on that lead. I was convinced I’d catch the guy, send him to jail, be a hero,” the man continued, laughing in spite of himself. “Nothing ever turns out the way you expect it to though, right? So, I decided to go undercover. It would be my hardest job yet, pretending to be an actual pedophile,” he explained, sounding almost sick to his stomach. “Were you able to gain his trust?” I asked cautiously. He nodded his head, yes. “I was sweating bullets when I showed up to that awful bar again, worrying he would recognize me,” the man divulged. “Luckily, though, I have changed a lot over the years. I lost a lot of weight when I quit drinking and started exercising regularly. I didn’t give a single shit about my appearance before, either. I walked around with greasy hair down to my shoulders and this gross scraggly beard,” the man elaborated, using his hands to demonstrate the extraordinary length his facial hair had grown to. “Plus, we were wasted – both of us, all of the time. I hardly spoke to him, so I didn’t think he would recognize my voice. It seemed I was right. When I took a seat next to him, he had no idea who I was.” “What happened next?” I urged, unsure of what to expect. The man grimaced. “Honestly, you don’t even want to know. Essentially, I convinced him that I was a pedophile who was interested in abducting a child to satisfy my sick… *needs*. It took a little while, but eventually he agreed to take me out for a drive to explain everything he knew about the subject,” he replied, rubbing each of his thumbs along the side of his index fingers, the skin reddening with each stroke. “He picked me up at eight, and we went on a tour of his perversion.” I shuddered at the thought. “Yeah, that’s how I felt. I was both nervous and disgusted. He drove me to each of the spots from which he abducted children, then we’d stop at each and he’d describe the tortures he put each child through,” the man elaborated as he began to cry. He moved his hands to shield his face, seemingly embarrassed by the emotional reaction. He finally placed his hands back in his lap as he added, “I did find my boy. The lead was correct. The man steered us to just down the street from the boy’s house, then explained that he snatched him as he was playing outside. He kept him for three days, beating and molesting him. Ultimately, he stuffed a bunch of leaves down his throat and held his hand over his face until he suffocated.” I massaged the center of my forehead, sore from furrowing my brow in concern. The man wept openly as we sat wordlessly for several minutes. He composed himself enough to resume, “I could’ve stopped him there, had him drop me off at home. I had the recording of his confession, and he had provided me with plenty of avenues for further investigation of physical evidence. Something kept me there, though. I needed to know about the others. I didn’t know how many more there were, but I’d listen to them all.” “How many were there?” I inquired. “More than you could possibly believe,” the man cried. “I listened for hours as he reminisced smugly on every vile deed he had ever committed. He kept these kids alive for days, torturing them, aroused by the sounds of their cries. I’d had more than I could possibly stand when he stopped the car in a strangely familiar place, claiming it as the site of his first abduction.” I cocked my head to one side as I waited for him to explain further. “My old house,” he murmured solemnly. “I just stared up at the structure, completely dumbstruck. I knew then that I was face to face with my daughter’s killer, and I was acting like he was my best pal. But then another thought struck me. We didn’t live in that house anymore when my daughter disappeared.” Puzzled, I pressed, “then why were you there?” The man hung his head as he responded, “I lived there with my wife and daughter before she left me. Or, at least I *thought* she left me… I was such a worthless drunk, I didn’t even begin to suspect she had met with foul play. This motherfucker detailed every last moment of her final hours. Apparently, he had played the sounds of a crying infant on a tape recorder. Of course, my wife came out to come to assist,” he sobbed. “From there, he seized my wife and subjected her to the worst fate I could imagine. Threatening to come back for our daughter, he forced her to break her own legs with a sledgehammer. This disgusting fuck laughed as he recalled drilling a hole into her skull to end her life. I’ll never forget that sick grin he had on his face as he explained that the hole wasn’t *just* for killing her.” The man was hysterical now, ramming his fists into the couch cushions as he moaned in agony. “Sir… I – I’m so sorry,” I breathed, unsure of how to respond. “It gets worse,” the man said, his voice now disturbingly monotonous. “Apparently, the man had been looking for my daughter that night – I just happened to be out with her at the time. But, according to him, my wife looked young enough to still get him off. He’d never stopped longing for my daughter, but the two of us moved out of that place pretty soon after my wife left – died,” he said, his voice splintering as he corrected himself. “I couldn’t afford the rent anymore, so we moved to the other side of town. The bad side of town. Right into *his* neighborhood,” the man added, laying his forehead in one palm. “My daughter was walking home from school on that shit day, because I *forgot* her, and walked right past that bar as the man stepped out for a smoke. Imagine my ecstasy, he said, when the girl I’d been fantasizing about ever since the beginning skipped right into me,” he snarled, digging his fingernails into one palm. I just stared at the man. The man’s anger melted away into despair once more. “He nailed her to a tree in a wooded area, returning daily to assault her. My little girl lived for eight days in this absolute hell before she ultimately perished due to exposure. It was cold, and that awful snowstorm last year finally took her,” the man choked through tears. He continued through gritted teeth, “The man said, it was like the thrill of my first kill all over again, but *better*.” “Did you leave then?” I asked. “No, I did not,” the man admitted. “When you lose control of yourself, it really is like what they say in the movies. I literally saw red. I was hardly aware of what I was doing, but I knew I was killing him. It took me a bit to realize and fully understand what I’d actually done to him. I’d taken the bottle of beer he’d been drinking and shoved it inside of him, wanting - *needing* him to feel what those poor kids must have felt. I took a hammer I found in his trunk and struck the bottom of the bottle, shattering it. Then I beat him past the point of death. I… I don’t think I deserve to live after this. And I don’t know if I can.” I covered my mouth with one hand, eyes widening. “Sir, that’s all I need to hear. If you’re ready, I’ll prepare the injection.” Something I have not yet mentioned in any of my cases is that I do give my clients one final opportunity to back out of the procedure before we begin. I am generally sure of my judgment by the time I offer, but I like to go the extra ten percent to avoid regretting my actions. Usually, just as I’m about to finish preparing the needle, I’ll call from the other room, “are you absolutely sure that you want to go through with this?” I let the client answer this question alone, so as to avoid any potential pressure from my presence. This time, the man raised his voice to respond, “you know what, I’m actually not sure.” “Why not?” I asked, wandering to the doorframe to more easily discuss his reasoning. The man exhaled an exaggerated sigh. “Well, to be honest, I want nothing more than to die right now. I’ve killed an abhorrent man, true, but regardless of his behavior… I need to answer for this. More importantly, I can’t let the truth about what happened to my wife and daughter die with me,” he explained, tears silently slipping from his eyes. “It’s just not right.” I nodded gently, making my way back to my seat. “I know, sir. I must admit, I just sat in there for a few minutes instead of readying the injection. I could sense a hint of apprehension in your voice towards the end there,” I confessed, reaching down to the floor where I had stashed the paper bag to return his payment. After he had reclaimed the bag, I placed my hand atop his. “You have done an awful thing, but you are still a good man. You feel guilt for the mistakes you have made throughout your life. I would have killed you if you wanted, but I know this is not the path you truly want to take. I respect that. The man you are deciding to be right now… your daughter [would be proud](https://www.reddit.com/r/hercreation/).” [I](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dyeb0f/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [II](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dzjr8q/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [III](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/e01n9m/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [IV](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/e12izn/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [V](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/e4t824/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [VI](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/e5uzer/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [VII](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/e7ptwn/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [VIII](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/eb6dot/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [IX](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ebpjoc/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [X](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/eeyl14/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | XI | [XII](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ekvxj9/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [XIII](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/eo5az5/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [XIV](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/et4gqa/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [XV](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/evo0y5/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/)",
708,"I wish my child didn't existI've always been on the fence about having children. I was leaning more towards ""no"" than ""yes"", but I guess a part of me thought it might be nice when I wasn't sleep deprived and cleaning fecal matter. I was dating my girlfriend at the time for almost 2 years, and we had never talked about kids or marriage. She told me she was on the pill, and so I stupidly took her word for it and ceased my use of condoms. I found out the hard way that she wasn't consistent with taking her birth control. I still remember that moment very vividly. It was Christmas Eve and she had this huge smile on her face as she handed me a small skinny box to open as an early gift. Inside that box was a positive pregnancy test. My heart dropped, but she looked extremely happy. We ended up having a huge fight because I obviously brought up her birth control, only for her to tell me that she was bad at taking it and that I was a terrible boyfriend for not sharing her excitement. I wanted to leave her right then and there...but I didn't. She was miserable for me to be around during her pregnancy. She was happy and smiley to everyone except for me. It was like she was a completely different person from the girl I had been dating for the past nearly 2 years. She was entitled and refused to be held accountable for her antics, because of the baby. She would wake me up 2 hours before I had to go to work to get her whatever the fuck she was craving that week. If I said no she would take it to my mother or her sister and I would be berated over the phone or in person that same week. I tried to take it all in stride though, I tried to kill her with kindness but it was never good enough. I hoped she would go back to normal after giving birth. Of course there was a part of me that wondered if I should just abandon ship and pay child support, but I couldn't. My own father did that and I know it made my childhood very difficult. Plus my own mother would probably never forgive me. So I stuck around and tried to put on my brave face, even if my girlfriend never thought it was good enough. I wish I could say things got better when the baby came, but it didn't. We were constantly at each other's throats due to the sleep deprivation and I hated my new life. There was nothing I could find redeeming about being a parent. My life savings were going down the drain, I had to give up all my non child-friendly hobbies, I always felt *dirty* because of the constant diaper changing, spit up incidents, mushy food showing up in random places, etc etc. If this weren't anonymous I would say some bullshit about how ""it's all worth it because nothing compares to the love I feel for my child"", but that's not really true either. I ""love"" my child, but it's purely out of duty. None of it is worth it. Oh, and my girlfriend? She's constantly complaining about motherhood, yet can't shut up on social media about how amazing parenthood is and how it's made her a better person. I can assure you, she has changed for the worse. It's been 5 years, and I'm a shell of the person I once was. My entire life has been filled up with children's birthday parties, screaming, tantrums for stupid reasons, working, begging a tiny human to *please* eat their food, having my family go on and on about how wonderful parenthood is while my girlfriend gives me shit for not proposing to her yet while hinting she wants another baby. Jokes on her, I have a vasectomy appointment coming up. What no one knows is how suicidal I am. I am happy for my kid and I do the best I can to shield them from all of this, but I wish I wasn't alive. I'm a terrible person, and I never should have been a father. This should be obvious, but for the love of god do not have kids if you don't 100000% want them. And if you're one of those people who pressures people into having kids, stop that shit. Leave them alone, they're better off. &#x200B; Edit- Just want to clarify that my girlfriend's behavior does not represent all women. I don't even have proof that she has trapped me, but even if she did it has nothing to do with the rest of the female population. I love women, and I support women. Hell, a part of me still loves my girlfriend and I wholeheartedly support her and my child. I'm not trying to play the victim, so if this post came off like that I apologize. I just really don't want this to turn into a woman hating fest. I'm just critical about the idea of parenthood being for everyone, my story proves it isn't. Edit 2- I stepped away from this post with the intention of just tossing it into the void and going on with my life, but here I am. I want to thank everyone for trying to help me and my situation. I've read every single comment, and I understand how this post came off as me throwing a pity party. But I don't regret it, because I feel this is a not so uncommon side of parenthood that most people refuse to address. Many will be happy to know I will be separating from my girlfriend. I've talked to my mom about it, and she's pretty pissed. I don't have many people in my corner about this decision, but I feel like I have no choice but to make it. I have no intention of withdrawing from my kid's life because even though parenthood isn't for me, I'm still a parent. No taking that back. Something else I want to address is that I've gotten a few messages saying that I'm a deadbeat father. If I were a deadbeat dad I don't think I would be as depressed as I am now. I put everything I have into being there for my child, even if it drains me. I will look into therapy, but I'm not my own biggest priority at the moment. I wanted my story to remind people that having kids isn't a good decision for everyone, and that romanticizing it and throwing the negative aspects of it into the shadows does no one favors. I'm trying the best I can, and I will continue to. But I needed to tell someone, *anyone* how I feel on the inside. Peace.",
709,"My psychiatrist told me to ""stop consulting the Web for symptom research or online support groups"". Wondering if that is good advice.So I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder at age 19 and I am currently 22 and in the process of coming off my anti-anxiety medication fluoxetine after being on it for a few years. Recently, I felt the need to search on DuckDuckGo about patient experiences on and coming off antidepressants and I got a mixed bag. I saw some horror stories that made me wonder if I am going to be dealing with withdrawals and side effects for years after stopping my medication. I told my psychiatrist who is managing my taper about this and she told me ""please stop using search engines for researching any medical issues now and in the future"". She then said that the reason why she thinks I did that was to find some reassuring material online, but I got mostly horror stories and statements such as... &#x200B; >Everyone responds differently to antidepressants, so it is possible that you could experience some nasty long-term side effects. This scares me because I don't want to be in a zombie like state for the rest of my life. The best thing I can do is to take one day at a time but I feel emotionally numb and it is expected that I feel that way until I come off the medication by my psychiatrist. Nobody can reassure me that everything is going to be OK. I feel that nobody truly cares about my well-being and that everyone that interacts with me does so with an intent of getting something for return such as money or advice. I don't have many friends and most of my family members are scatted throughout the continent of North America. I am an only child of a single parent and my mom is preoccupied with her problems so she doesn't have that much time to listen to me. I cannot afford therapy due to being unemployed and having exhausted my savings. I tried talking to strangers on services like *7 Cups of Tea* but sometimes I either get a really mean asshat who treats me poorly or a overtly pessimistic person who causes me to think more negative thoughts. &#x200B; Then I tried this weird site called [`https://survivingantidepressants.org`](https://survivingantidepressants.org) and while it was nice that I wasn't alone, the people on that site hold anti-psychiatry views through the use of words like ""recovered from Lexapro"", ""finally free from the bondage of Zoloft after 4 years"" and all of that other weird stuff that made me regret visiting that website. Told my psychiatrist about that site and she told me that if I am not going to do my due diligence of checking which websites are reputable and don't have a nefarious agenda, then she suggested that I should avoid ""Dr. Web"" for seeking support and information about health related issues. I feel trapped and while I am not suicidal, I am not sure how I can fix this problem. I wonder if I am going to be in this zombie like emotional state for the rest of my life and if anyone besides my family would care about me enough to be more involved in my life. Please help me. Thank you.",
710,"Cryopod Refresh 202: Jepthath's Ultimatum_Due to the wound Bael dealt me; I was forced to withdraw along with my troops. Naturally, our retreat still ended up bearing many fruits. In total, we slew more than three thousand demonic broodmothers, though what proportion of the whole that amounted to, we did not know._ _Within three days, the newfound Titan power flowing through my veins allowed my broken bones to heal. Immediately, I launched an assault on the demonic hordes. We ravaged one bloodskin den after another. No matter their rank, no matter how they begged for mercy, we killed every last one we laid our eyes on._ _However, even as I continually recruited new villages from one end of the continent to the next, I began to realize my soldiers were far too free-spirited. I knew not the reason why, but unlike Hercules's Legion, who obeyed his every word, mine would often do whatever they pleased. Occasionally, this led to a more successful mission. Often, it did not._ _To my disgust, there were some warriors who, upon obtaining my power, focused exclusively on satisfying their desires. For the new Legion, I recruited anyone I could find. Men, women, and children too. I had little time left alive, and as such, I put little thought into who should join my Legion's ranks._ _That was when the chaos began._ _Some men, upon gaining enough power to stand against Demon Barons, decided their time would be better spent subjugating unascended humans. When I learned of the first time a Legionnaire assaulted a series of helpless villager women, I became petrified with rage. Unable to take back the man's power, I instead used my superior strength to smash his skull into pieces, then strung his body up in the village's square as a warning to those who might commit similar acts in the future._ _With the threat of a demonic invasion hanging over our necks every day, I could not fathom what would bring a man to attack his fellow human beings. For the first time, I realized humanity had a dark side, a terrible, vile nature hidden within us. As bad as the demons were, the idea that one powerful human could turn those weaker than him into his playthings filled me with cold dread._ _In my opinion, the bloodskins paled in comparison to any human who might turn against his own people. That was my definition of true evil._ _And so, with this newfound realization, it only took me one month of slaughtering demons before I decided to head to Mount Sinai. I needed to survey the damage the demons had dealt to angelkind, as well as fulfill a few needs plaguing myself at the time._ Jepthath's vision shifts. He, along with one hundred empowered humans, stomp through the pitch-black corridors of Mount Sinai's underground tunnels. They travel at a brisk walk, keeping their eyes peeled for dangers lurking within the tunnel system's crevices. However, no matter where they look, they find nothing. Unlike in the past, where angels would roam the halls and keep the ancient torches lit, not a soul whispers within the darkness. Not even a mouse. Within half an hour, the platoon of hunters reaches the entrance to Heaven's Gate. They arrive in the large antechamber, still fortified with Camael's divine metallurgy, only to find a pair of angels standing guard outside the now-disabled warpgate to Heaven. A woman wearing a frightening amount of platemail, standing six and a half feet tall, towers over her far more diminutive brother, a wingless angel Jepthath has met before. The wingless angel's eyes bulge as he spots the platoon of humans stomping toward him. ""Ah! It's... it's him! That man is the human who saved my life!"" The female angel's glorious golden hair flows out from beneath a helmet adorned with miniature wings. With her face shrouded by metal and only her hardened blue eyes visible, the humans can't make out her expression. However, at her brother's words, she lowers her sword. ""Is that so, Shepherd? Art thou laying claim to this mortal saving thee from the jowls of the demons?"" ""Yes, yes, Sister Frida!"" Shepherd says, his breathing erratic. He leans heavily on a staff, due to a crippled leg. ""This human, his name is... is..."" ""Jepthath. Indeed, I am the one who saved you, though, in truth, all I managed was to mend your wounds and stymie the blood flowing from your back. I am pleased to see you've survived the demon's attack."" Shepherd's excited expression disappears. Gloom takes its place. ""Aye... survived."" Frida sheathes her sword. A deep sigh escapes her lips as she lowers her head. ""I know not whether we were fortunate or unfortunate to count ourselves among the living. After Satan's suicidal attack, not ten thousand of my brothers and sisters survived to fight another day. We've lost the war."" Jepthath's eyes shift slightly. An odd look crosses over his face. ""I beg your pardon, but I do not know what events transpired in Heaven. Might you explain the situation to me?"" Frida raises her head to gaze into Jepthath's eyes. ""I know not thy identity, human, nor why I should inform thee of anything thou knoweth not. What is thy heritage? How art thou capable of speaking the common tongue when thy people are little more than ignorant apes?"" ""Ah, so you don't know,"" Jepthath says, a hint of mockery in his voice. ""Humanity has ascended. Under my hand, we will rise to defeat the demons. That is why I've come today. I seek the aid of the Archangels in my quest to rid the world of the bloodskins."" ""Thou dost request our help? Bah! What assistance can we render?"" Frida asks. ""Our numbers are but a fraction of their former might. We cannot replenish our strength, but the demons can! They will come knocking at our door soon, hence why Raphael has ordered my brother and me to stand guard at Heaven's Gate."" Shepherd takes a step toward Jepthath. He leans even more heavily on his staff than before as his expression turns to one of pain. ""Please, benefactor, do not despise my sister for her words. We must keep Heaven's Gate deactivated unless expressly ordered by Raphael. As the weakest of our people, he placed us here as bait for the demons. Should the Emperors come knocking, we will detonate a blast of holy energy and raze the mountain to the ground. We will gladly give our lives to protect our family! We cannot allow entry for anyone, not even one as righteous as thee."" Jepthath's gaze falls upon the deactivated warpgate leading to Heaven. ""I see. I am not your enemy. We share the same foe, the hellspawn army of Satan the Devil. Will you send a message to Raphael for me? Tell him I am the inheritor of the Titans, and I've come to offer my services to the angels. With your numbers depleted, we must do what we can to eliminate the bloodskins before they become too powerful."" Shepherd and Frida both glance at each other. Her expression is one of immediate rejection, but before she can get a word in, Shepherd drops to his knees. ""Sister, please! This human saved my life! I owe him a great debt. As he is a mortal, I will endure great shame if he perishes before I pay him back! All he asks is for thee to send a message to our eldest brother. Can we not perform such a trifle for my benefactor's sake?!"" Frida hesitates. Confronted with her brother's tear-filled eyes, she eventually relents. ""Alright. I do not owe this human a debt, but given thy mana deficiency, I will send the message in thy stead. Were thee to possess even a drop of mana, I know thou woulds't assist this human to thy dying breath. Thou art a most righteous figure, Shepherd."" Frida turns and places her palm against a symbol on the warp-gate's control panel. Heaven's Gate hums to life for a few moments as she pours a significant amount of mana into its energy matrix. Eventually, Frida pulls back and drops to her knees. Sweat drips off her brow, forcing her to remove her helmet and wipe her forehead. ""I... I sent the message. Our brothers will respond within the hour."" Frida's face is that of a hardened warrior, someone who has seen countless battles in her lifetime. With piercing blue eyes capable of melting steel and a golden head of hair, her appearance resembles a goddess of war. Jepthath nods. ""I understand. My men and I will wait."" Each of the soldiers fans out and presses their backs to the enchanted steel walls. Ten others walk just outside the chamber and stand guard, keeping a vigilant eye on their surroundings in case the demons decide to attack. _As I waited, I evaluated the two angels before me. Without his wings, and still suffering from a hobbled leg, Shepherd was, without a doubt, the most pitiful figure I had ever seen in all my years. However, Frida was a menacing warrior reminiscent of Archangel Uriel. For Shepherd to claim she was among the weakest of the remaining angels, it filled me with disgust. How many angels had perished for someone of Frida's caliber to count as a lowborn?_ _I passed the next hour by chatting idly with Shepherd. Frida did not allow him to explain Heaven's situation to me, but even without him making explicit statements, I was able to glean a hint of the devastation Satan had unleashed._ Suddenly, the air inside the chamber becomes noticeably less stale. A shimmer in the room's center causes everyone to step back. Moments later, a portal rips into the fabric of reality, as Raphael himself steps through. Alongside him, Camael and Michael emerge from Heaven to examine the humans standing outside their domain. Raphael gazes at Jepthath for only a moment. He evaluates the human's glowing eyes with a hint of disgust before shaking his head. ""Come with me. Only thou may enter Heaven. This entourage of warriors must stay behind."" His words provide no chance for Jepthath to argue. If the human wishes to enter Heaven, he must accept Raphael's demands. Jepthath blinks slowly. ""Very well. Only I will come. The rest of my warriors will remain here and stand guard to protect Heaven's Gate. We have come in peace, after all."" ""Peace, ye say?"" Raphael asks. His expression turns grim. ""I remember the last time someone who came in peace wished to enter Heaven. Luckily, even if thou dost desire to cause mayhem, there is nothing left to destroy."" Camael nods. Her expression turns grim, revealing the Hell she's endured over the past month. ""Indeed. We've only just begun the rites of burial for those who passed. Given the number of fallen, we've even had to expedite the ceremonies for all but the most honored warriors. Such a disgrace will stain our people forever."" ""I understand,"" Jepthath says. ""I will come alone and without protest."" ""Thou understand nothing,"" Michael says, his voice cold. ""But soon, thou shalt."" The Archangels step through Raphael's portal, and Jepthath follows them. As the guests leave and the portal closes, Shepherd stares at the spot where they disappeared with a longing expression. ""Sister Frida. I... I wish upon my heart of hearts that human is capable of slaying the demons. They took everything from us. We must take swift revenge."" ""Aye,"" Frida replies. She rests her hand on the hilt of her blade and gazes at the hundred men standing with their backs to the enchanted walls. ""As do I."" .................................................... **[Recommended Listening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r4fIgHO3bo)** Jepthath steps through Raphael's portal. The moment he enters Heaven, a stench unlike any other assaults him, causing him to stagger backward and swallow meaty chunks of bile. Iron, sulfur, and traces of burnt copper mix into a gag-inducing cocktail with enough potency to make his eyes water. ""Gurk..."" As Jepthath blinks back tears and forces down the roiling in his stomach, he opens his eyes a little wider to examine his surroundings. Where once Heaven was a realm filled with beautiful trees, flowers, and grass as far as the eye could see, in the wake of Satan's detonation, it has become a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Thick, bloody mist lingers in the air, blowing to and fro by winds of an unknown origin. The ground squishes beneath Jepthath's feet as the gore from millions of angels and demons blends into a foul, toxic swamp capable of choking all it touches. Jepthath gingerly takes a step forward, only to grimace when his foot sinks three inches into the soggy soil. The ground seizes him like quicksand, making forward movement difficult at best, if not impossible. ""Camael gazes upon the human's predicament and sighs. ""Here. This trinket will grant thee the gift of flight. Its power is limited, but I believe it will last for at least a few hours if used sparingly."" The Archangel of Divination hands Jepthath a perfectly polished pearl, just small enough to fit in his hand. ""M-my thanks, Archangel,"" Jepthath replies, still trying to steady his churning stomach. He takes the pearl from her, wraps it within his hand, and sends a stream of mana into it. A moment later, he lifts off the ground and hovers a few feet above it, allowing him to travel forward safely. ""We've decontaminated the area where the Temple of Elderium once stood,"" Camael says, her tone emotionless. ""However, it will take us decades to remove the leftover remnants of Satan's miasma from all across Heaven. Cleaning up the remains of our fallen brothers and sisters will require even more time."" Jepthath hovers after the Archangels as they slowly flap their wings and glide across the bloody swamp. ""I... I do not understand. What happened here? My master, Hercules, told me of a terrible battle in Heaven, but he perished before the fighting ended."" ""Aye. We fought a war, and we lost,"" Michael says, his voice hollow. ""My memory is hazy due to the wounds I sustained fighting the Great Demon. However, what I do know is that Satan transformed himself into a living bomb. He unleashed enough destructive power to level the entirety of Heaven, as well as its inhabitants. With a single attack, he wiped out millions of bloodskins and angels."" Raphael flies closer to Michael. He places his hand on the Archangel of Courage's shoulder and sighs. ""Aye. Do not blame thyself, Michael. Thy battle against the Great Demon delayed us long enough to allow at least a fraction of our family to escape. Had ye not risked thy life to fight that monstrosity, Satan might have killed all of us with his underhanded soul manipulation."" ""A small consolation, given how many we did lose,"" Michael mutters. Jepthath listens to the Archangels as they travel eastward, toward the center of Heaven. Eventually, after a bit of back and forth, he uncovers the specifics of what happened during the War in Heaven. ""Gods. How could such devastation be possible?"" Raphael snorts. ""Compared to some of the beasts born during the Primordial era, Satan's attack was but a drop in the bucket. However, my people have declined over the eons, even to the point where such pitiful, wretched creatures can threaten us."" ""Nevertheless, Satan's army represents a significant threat to all of Earth,"" Jepthath says. ""Comparing him to long-dead monsters won't diminish his presence in the coming months and years."" ""The human speaks truth,"" Camael replies. ""Ah, over there. Look closely."" Jepthath follows Camael's indication as she gestures into the distance toward a massive stone platform laid atop Heaven's soil. Standing only inches tall, the width and circumference of the flat, stone table boggles Jepthath's mind. With a size big enough to encompass multiple human villages, the flat rock provides some shelter from the bloody swamp surrounding it. Two thousand angels stand or sit on the platform. They cluster together in groups of four to ten, chatting quietly about various happenings. Jepthath and the Archangels descend from the skies and land softly at the edge of the platform, where several high-ranking Cherubs turn and bow politely. ""Brothers Raphael and Michael. Sister Camael. This human must be the visitor you mentioned."" ""Aye,"" Camael says. Have Uzziel summon a small structure. We need to deliberate with this man in private."" ""Very well. We'll dispatch Hermes on the double. Uzziel is likely still trying to cleanse the Bloody Sea even as we speak."" Michael's expression sours. ""A thankless task."" ""Aye."" The Cherubs disperse, leaving Jepthath and the Archangels alone. With nobody in earshot, Raphael turns to face the human warrior. ""Verily, thou dids't come here today to achieve some goal. Might I inquire as to what thou art seeking?"" Jepthath hesitates for a moment. ""Ah... in truth, I came to ask for assistance from your people. My warriors are more than capable of wiping out demonkind, but the bloodskin burrows are well-hidden and scattered throughout the land. I hoped to gather tens of thousands of angels to sweep across the Earth from the skies in search of the demon's dens... but seeing how many of thy people remain, that request won't do anymore."" Raphael narrows his eyes. ""Hmm..."" ""Is something the matter, Eldest Archangel?"" ""Indeed,"" Raphael replies, his voice curt. ""Thy master was none other than Hercules, the Titan who enslaved Uzziel and Michael to do his bidding. He nearly seized control of all the Archangels during the War in Heaven! Thou art lucky I have yet to slay thee where ye stand. Had ye attempted to bring thy invasion force along, I would have sent thy soul scattering to the furthest reaches of the Great Beyond before thou coulds't utter a word of complaint."" ""Invasion force?"" Jepthath asks. His eyes glow slightly as anger builds in the back of his mind. ""Hmph. Now, listen here, Eldest Archangel! I do not take kindly to slander. Have you any idea how many demons lurk at the edges of Mount Sinai's base? I brought a contingent of warriors along as protection against bloodskin ambushers, not because I felt the need to threaten the pitiful remnants of your society with my superior strength!"" Jepthath grinds his teeth together. ""I understand you've lost many brothers and sisters, but don't pretend that you are alone in your misery! The bloodskins killed every member of my family. My Master perished while trying to protect the angels and Titans. He gave his power to me so that I might someday eradicate our shared enemies from the Earth!"" Jepthath's rage ignites the fire boiling within Michael's veins. In the blink of an eye, the Archangel of Courage draws his sword and swings it toward the human's neck, pausing the instant it touches Jepthath's skin. ""Insolent human! Know thy place! Speak one more blasphemous word, and I'll rid the world of thy apostasy right here and now! I'll have thy head roll across the plains without-"" ""Michael, stop,"" Raphael says, his voice unnaturally calm. ""Sheathe thy blade."" ""But brother! This human-"" ""Put the sword away,"" Raphael repeats, his eyes revealing an ominous glint. ""Unless thou dost think me incapable of killing this human where he stands."" Michael's breath catches in his throat. His gaze meets Raphael's, causing a hint of fear to appear in the Archangel of Courage's gaze. Immediately, he yanks his sword back and stabs it into his sheathe, then turns away. ""Very well. Thou art more than capable of slaying a weak little human. I'll take my leave."" Michael doesn't wait for Raphael's response. As if guided by an unspoken fear, the young hothead flaps his wings and soars away, leaving only Camael and Raphael alone with the human. Jepthath touches the spot where Michael's blade rested. ""Oh? What an interesting response, Archangel of Wisdom. It seems you've comprehended something your brother did not."" Raphael's eyes flicker with an indecipherable emotion. ""Aye. Thy powers come from a soul manipulator. Hercules passed down his power to thee, and therefore, even were we to slay thee here, thy powers would no doubt pass on to another human."" Jepthath smiles. ""It seems your Archangel title is not merely for show."" ""Tsk."" Raphael's nose twitches. He glances at Camael, who continues to keep her gaze locked on Jepthath. ""Sister?"" Camael blinks. ""What?"" ""I should like to ask thee the same question. Thou hath stood silently and observed this human since we arrived. When thy gaze falls upon someone for such a prolonged period, it can only mean..."" ""Aye,"" Camael says. ""I've performed multiple divinations on this man."" ""As I thought,"" Raphael murmurs. ""Have ye anything to say?"" ""I'll wait until Uzziel's arrival,"" Camael replies, her tone cryptic. Jepthath crosses his arms. A smile spreads across his face as he silently observes the Archangel's expressions. _Born a mortal, someone who had roamed the Earth looking for the bare essentials to continue living, I had never once met the Archangels in person. However, my Master always sought to keep me informed during his lifetime. He provided me with vast amounts of information on not only the Archangels but anyone else who caught his attention. The Archangels all looked down on me, as they hadn't a clue who I was, but I knew within an instant that Camael was different from her siblings._ _Yes. Camael knew I was more than just a man, more than the inheritor of Hercules's ancestry. As she searched my future, I could only guess at what she saw, but her reluctance to move against me told me all I needed to know._ _The Archangels were scared._ _And why shouldn't they be? A single demon had succeeded at turning eons of angelic rule to dust. Where before they numbered more than three and four million strong, after Satan's suicidal attack, their population had dropped to a fraction of its former power._ _The angels could not repopulate, but the demons could. Even with their society in disarray and hopelessness spread across their ranks, the leaders of angelkind sought anything, any chance they could take at protecting themselves from total extinction._ _In Michael's eyes, I was nothing but an insolent human, a mortal born to feed him spiritual energy._ _But by Camael's reckoning, I was a faint spark of hope. I was a chance to hold the bloodskins back while her people rebuilt Heaven._ _Raphael might not possess his sister's divinations, but he knew better than to second-guess her wariness toward me. The mere fact she hadn't spoken a word during my verbal assault indicated she valued my existence more than punishing my slander._ _Having spoken fewer than a hundred words, I managed to deduce the true strength angelkind possessed, and I found it lacking._ ... An hour passes. Jepthath continues to poke and prod Camael and Raphael, but they offer little more than small talk. Eventually, Raphael breathes a sigh of relief as he spots several dozen angels flying over the horizon. ""Uzziel. Finally."" Before Uzziel arrives, a speedy blur zips through the skies. Faster than Jepthath's eyes can follow, the flash of movement zips past him and screeches to a halt before Raphael. A young-looking male Seraph, one wearing tight, form-fitting robes, snaps his fingers and flashes a huge grin. ""Yo! Eldest brother, I've returned! I found Uzziel in a flash, faster than you'd believe! It only took me like, three seconds! Zip, zoop, whapow! In and out, faster than-"" ""Yes, yes, much obliged, Hermes,"" Raphel says, his voice heavy. ""As always, thy speed is apprec-"" ""But I couldn't help how slow sister Uzziel flies!"" Hermes continues, running his mouth like a mouse hyped up on caffeine. ""I kept offering to fly her over here, but she always declined! I know you're in a rush, so I kept pushing and prodding, but she always just ignores me! What's the point of being a speed-zipper if I can't ever let loose and show off, ya know what I mean?! Some people are just so inconsiderate!"" Hermes babbles like a maniac. His words flow together so quickly that Jepthath winces from a rapidly developing migraine. Eventually, Camael walks over, places her hand on Hermes's shoulder, and clears her throat. ""_Ahem._ Brother Hermes, Raphael is tired. It would be improper to exhaust him, as thou art doing right now. Please head over to the Third District and continue assisting them with the cleanup."" ""Heck yeah!"" Hermes says, spinning on a dime. He whirls to face Camael and nods eagerly as if she's just given him the promotion of a lifetime. ""Oh, boy! I'll mop up those entrails lickety-split! I'll scrub and clean like you ain't never seen before! Zip-zoop, that's me! Whapow!"" Before the Archangels can say anything else, Hermes transforms into a blur of movement and zips away at lightspeed, leaving Camael with her mouth hanging half-open. ""Sigh..."" Camael groans. ""I never should have given him those damned boots."" Raphael smiles. ""Do not gaze upon Hermes with enmity, sister. His optimism shines through in every situation. 'Tis always a wonderful thing when one can smile and persevere in the face of adversity."" ""If _only_ he smiled and did _nothing_ else, I wouldn't mind,"" Camael grumbles. Both Archangels fall silent as Uzziel descends from the bloodied sky, along with a couple dozen low-ranked angels. The Archangel of Creation exhales deeply as she lands atop the stone platform and wipes her forehead. ""Brother Raphael! I came as quickly as I could. Hermes's message sounded urgent. Did something happen?"" Raphael frowns. ""Did Hermes fail to deliver my message properly? I sent for thee so that ye might summon a small, wooden hut for Camael and I. We need to speak with our visitor, this human, in private."" Uzziel shrugs. ""Hermes is sometimes difficult to understand. He speaks so quickly that I have trouble understanding him."" ""As do we all,"" Camael sighs. Raphael gestures toward Jepthath. Despite standing not far away from the Archangels, his appearance seems to have gone unnoticed by Uzziel. She turns to look at him, then flashes a radiant smile. ""Ah, one of my beloved children! How dost thou fare, little one? I apologize for Heaven's sorry state, but it won't take us long to clean everything up."" Jepthath maintains a neutral expression. ""Earthmother. I am Hercules's descendant, Jepthath, the inheritor of his power."" Uzziel's smile vanishes. She flashes a look of agitation at Raphael. ""What? This child is...?"" ""Aye,"" Raphael says with a nod. ""This human possesses all of Hercules's powers. Jepthath is one of Hercules's thralls, one who managed to escape during the battle against the Balrog six years ago. He's come to deliberate with us on a great many things."" Slowly, Uzziel nods. She returns her gaze to Jepthath, but her expression turns frosty. ""I see. Do not let me keep thee waiting, then, _Titanspawn._"" With a flippant series of gestures, Uzziel summons a small wooden building to the east, half a mile away from the stone platform. She bristles at Jepthath and pauses to waggle her finger at him. ""Do not think I have forgotten what thy master did to me. He attempted to seize control of Michael and me, and nearly rent Heaven in two. If thou dost make such an aggressive move against anyone here-"" ""Worry not,"" Jepthath says, interrupting Uzziel. ""I know full well what thou art capable of unleashing. I'm not here to fight."" His reply catches the Archangel off-guard. Uzziel eyeballs him for a moment before turning around and flying away. ""Farewell, then."" ... A minute later, Jepthath, Camael, and Raphael step inside Uzziel's summoned building. Little more than an ugly square box, it lacks any furnishings or decorations, but does possess a series of slits on its walls, allowing traces of Heaven's Light to slip inside and illuminate its interior. Raphael and Camael walk over and settle on the floor while assuming cross-legged stances. Jepthath takes a seat opposite them and mirrors their postures. ""Alright, Titanspawn,"" Raphael says, his voice even. ""State thy intentions and terms."" Jepthath nods. ""I came here in the hopes of acquiring a few thousand angel warriors for the sake of reconnaissance and surveillance. Locating the demon dens is my highest priority, after all. However, now that I know the pitiful state of your military, that request is off the table."" ""Indeed,"" Camael replies. ""Having performed a divination earlier, I could not help but note that thy future is in a much higher state of flux than other beings. Thy destiny appears to have a strong relationship with the fate of the Earth, though the ramifications of thy actions will not be fully comprehensible for several centuries."" ""What do you mean?"" Jepthath asks, his tone suspicious. ""What does my future have to do with our meeting?"" ""Everything,"" Camael replies. ""Helping thee could be a tremendous boon for our people. It could also lead to our doom. I am not opposed to assisting humans in their quest to wipe out demonkind, but given thy upbringing and he who begat thy powers, trusting thy intentions is remarkably difficult."" ""I agree,"" Raphael says. ""The underlying threat beneath thy words makes any promises thou might offer ring hollow. How can we trust thee, when thou dost arrive with ill intent riding thy coattails? Hercules betrayed us. We nearly went extinct as a result of his actions. If thou turneth against us, even if we should kill thee, thy power will transfer to another human. Thy specter will continue fighting us forever and ever."" ""That's right,"" Jepthath says. His eyes turn cold. ""Kill me, and another will take my place. I did not come here to sit around and exchange pleasantries, Archangel of Wisdom. I came because I have a war to win. If you can't give me troops, then you will have to supply something else. Something of equal or greater value."" Jepthath leans forward. His voice takes on a menacing tone. ""You don't have a choice. Without me, your people die. Anger me, and your people die. This point is not up for debate."" Camael glowers at Jepthath. ""If not military might, what can we possibly offer thee? Out with it! I haven't any interest in thy snake-like tongue. Tell us what ye desire and be on thy way."" Jepthath raises an eyebrow. ""Isn't that obvious? I expected the Archangel of Divination to understand my meaning without any issues. I want artifacts, Camael. Divine artifacts."" Camael's jaw drops. ""What? No... no! I won't- I won't give anyone but my brothers and sisters objects possessing the Creator's power. How dare thee presume upon my magnanimity!"" ""Hmph. As I said, you haven't any choice in the matter,"" Jepthath replies. ""I can crush the angels over the next thousand years, if I so please. If you don't give me what I want, and humanity falls to the demons, the fate which will befall you will be a million times worse. Besides, my desires aren't excessive. I need only a few artifacts, and I will provide the mana necessary for you to craft them. A generous offer, wouldn't you agree?"" Before Camael can reply, Raphael butts in. ""Aye, thy offer is indeed generous. Am I correct in assuming thy empowered warriors can regenerate their mana each night, as do the unascended plainsman?"" ""We can, and we do,"" Jepthath replies neutrally. ""Why? Do you wish to bargain?"" Raphael rubs his chin. ""After the battle which ravaged Heaven, my people are in dire need of mana. I cannot condone the usage of soul manipulation, but given the stakes, I will keep my lips sealed for now. However, if thou dost wish to receive Camael's divine artifacts, I will only permit thy transfer on the basis of equal trade."" ""Haha, I see,"" Jepthath chuckles. ""Let me guess. As I empower more and more humans, you will supply me with any artifacts I need, but on the condition that humans always donate their excess energy each night. Hm? Is that about right?"" Raphael's eyes flash with the light of insight. ""Thou dost possess Hercules's cunning. I see now why the lad bestowed his powers upon thee."" ""Don't flatter me, Raphael. I am only here on business."" Jepthath strokes his chin thoughtfully. ""Considering our situation, empowering thy people is of some benefit to me. Hercules's abilities require little mana to function. By the end of each day, my men will have barely used a fraction of their reserves. Donating what remains to the angels will cost me little while providing significant gains for both of us."" Camael glances at Raphael. ""Brother! My artifacts are not mere trinkets and baubles to be tossed from child to child! 'Tis only by the Creator's power than I am capable of creating such fearsome-"" ""Now, now, sister,"" Raphael says, keeping his voice low. ""The times are changing, as is the world around us. We've no reason to rest on our laurels. The human is offering us a chance to revive our society while crippling, if not outright destroying our enemies. I believe we can reach a satisfactory agreement, given the proper exchange of resources and goods."" ""But-!"" Raphael clears his throat. ""Ahem. Jepthath, woulds't thou be so kind as to allow me a moment with my sister. I will convince her to agree to thy terms."" Jepthath frowns. ""...Certainly. I will step outside for a few minutes."" Despite his words, Jepthath's tone seems surprisingly cautious. He evaluates the Archangel of Wisdom with more than a hint of suspicion. However, he still rises to his feet, steps outside, and closes the door behind himself. Minutes pass. Jepthath's inner voice plays over the vision. _As I awaited the Archangel's verdict, worries crept up from deep within my heart. I had only received scattered images of the war my Master witnessed in Heaven, but amongst those images, a recurring theme always played out in his head._ ""Never trust the angels."" _Hercules' repeated that mantra several times as the battles raged. Even after his voice faded and he passed on to the Great Beyond, I never forgot that message._ _The Archangels deliberated in secret, sending pangs of worry up my spine. Right as I began considering whether I should press my ear against the door and listen in on their conversation, it swung open to reveal Raphael's hunched-over figure._ ""We've finished deliberating,"" Raphael says. ""Come in."" Jepthath quietly releases a breath he'd been holding. He follows after Raphael, shuts the door, and sits down before the brother and sister. Immediately, he notices Camael's sullen expression, as well as her ashen skin. ""What did you decide?"" Jepthath asks. Camael fidgets uncomfortably. ""I do not enjoy the idea of granting anyone but an angel my artifacts. However, my brother has convinced me to make this sacrifice for the sake of my people. I will craft what thou dost require."" Jepthath nods sagely. ""I see. Is that all, then? I can't help but feel suspicious at your change of heart. What did Raphael say to convince you to my side?"" Camael sighs. ""I... I have always prided myself on my virtuousness and morality. Never once have I compromised in the face of evil. However, after losing so many brothers and sisters to the demons, I realize now that I erred in my judgment. Sometimes, one cannot adhere to the past, lest it causes their future to crumble."" ""Mmm. Well-spoken. Well-spoken, indeed..."" Jepthath mutters. _Gazing upon the disheartened Archangel of Divination, for some reason, I felt no joy in my victory. It seemed to me that I had willingly stepped into a trap, one which had yet to spring. However, no matter how I pondered and questioned the Archangel's behavior, I could not determine anything Raphael had done that might endanger me or my goals._ Raphael smiles. ""Thy mentor, Hercules, was his own man, as thou art thine. I was wrong to evaluate thee with the same lens I did the son of Zeus. I look forward to collaborating with thee in the coming years, Jepthath."" Jepthath nods. ""As do I, Archangel of Wisdom. Thank you for coming around to my way of thinking."" Raphael's eyes twinkle with a strange, eerie luster. ""Aye. We both have much to gain from this arrangement. So very, very much, indeed."" _The Archangel's tone only increased my suspicions. Sadly, many years would pass before I finally comprehended the depths of his schemes._ ....................................... **FOR RETURNING READERS FROM CLASSIC: Please use spoiler tags when commenting on anything that might ruin the story for new readers, especially if that information is based on your knowledge of Classic!** >!This is what a spoiler looks like!

711,"The case of Kim & Ken Heyrman – two children went missing in broad daylight, 26 years later the case is still not solved. Their mother never stopped fighting to know what happened. **The case of Kim & Ken Heyrman – two children went missing in broad daylight, 26 years later the case is still not solved. Their mother never stopped fighting to know what happened.** This is an older case from Belgium. My first write up was about Katrien De Cuyper, a 15-year old girl who went missing in the same area in 1991. I mentioned Kim & Ken briefly in the write up but I think they deserve their own post on here, as we are approaching the 26th birthday of their disappearance. You can read that one here if you’re interested. It also gives some background on the Zandvoort scandal which is referenced in this write up as well as the cases could be connected. [https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/9ius9b/the\_case\_of\_katrien\_de\_cuyper\_a\_teenage\_girl/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/9ius9b/the_case_of_katrien_de_cuyper_a_teenage_girl/) **The disappearance:** On January 10th, Kim (11) and her brother Ken ( 8) left their home in Borgerhout to go play soccer with some friends. They would also have a sleepover and thus spend the night at that friends house. The next morning, their mother Tinny Mast, 28 was alarmed when the children didn’t came home. It later appeared that they never even arrived at the friend’s house. They were last seen on the tram at the Schijnpoortweg, near the Antwerp docks. The mother immediately alerted the police but she was not taken very seriously. The police dismissed her worries stating that they probably ran away and would turn up later. This is the start of a very tumultuous relationship between the mother and the police. Tinny claims to this day that the case remains unsolved due to their incompetence. Some background on the family. Tinny was a very young mother who at 28 had been divorced twice and had three children by three different fathers. She got married the first time at only 16 years old. She got Kim at 17 and divorced the father only 4 months after her birth. She remarried Rudi Heyrman who also adopted Kim when Ken was born. She divorced him as well and got remarried with Manuel Lanssens. At the time of their disappearance, she had a 14- months old son, Axel and was 6 months pregnant with her daughter Luna. She miscarried on January 13, eleven days after the disappearance of her two oldest children. **The investigation:** As stated above, the police didn’t do much at first. Tinny launched her own search party along with family and friends in the neighborhood. Frantically they searched the area where the children were last seen, searching around the docks and in abandoned houses, without finding any clues. She contacted the press to get more attention for the case which the police didn’t like, further straining their relationship. Tinny mast became a suspect herself and was interrogated for hours. She claims that the police was wasting their time and they were trying to paint a bad picture of her to destroy her credibility with journalists and in the media. She claims that the police looked down on her and thought of her as a ‘trashy mom’ because of her lack of education, low income and tumultuous love life. Five weeks later, the case became national news when Kim’s body was discovered on February 11 1994 in the Asia dock ( a dock in the port of Antwerp). She was killed with multiple stab wounds and sexually assaulted. Autopsy showed that she was killed shortly after her disappearance. Two weeks later, Ken’s sweater was found. Some time later, his soccer goalkeepers gloves where put in Tinny mast’s mailbox. Those were the last tangible clues ever found. Ken was never seen again nor was his body ever found. **Later leads** As time went by, the case became cold but some leads surfaced, mostly linked to other cases. I’ll discuss them here briefly. **1996**: The Dutroux scandal erupted in Belgium. For those who don’t know, it’s the biggest child abduction/ pedophilia scandal in Belgium. He was found guilty of abducting multiple girls between the ages of 8 – 18 all over Belgium. Tinny got hope that this might mean a breaktrough for her case as well. Kim & Ken’s case got re-examined but it turned out there was no connection. Tinny was one the vocal figures demanding justice for all victims. **1998:** the Zandvoort scandal. This lead is eerily similar to a major lead in Katrien de Cuypers case. After the death of know porn producer Gerry Ulrich, a lot of child porn resurfaced. During this investigation, Tinny klings to the hope that new clues regarding Ken’s fate will resurface. She gives multiple interviews during this time, stating that she is sure that her son is abducted by a pedophile network. Following this investigation, Tinny was giving a TV interview for ‘Tros Vermist’, a Dutch tv show about missing persons. As they were discussing the case of Kim & Ken, the interviewer mentioned that they found a CP picture of an approximately 12-year old child looking like Ken and that they passed it along to the Belgian police, but apparently both parents denied it was him. Tinny was shocked at that revelation, claiming she has never been shown that picture. When she looked at the picture (again, or for the first time depending on who you believe here), she was sure she recognized her son, claiming that he was taken by a pedophile network and that he was possibly still alive ( seeing how the boy in the pictures was older than Ken at the time he disappeared). The police claim that she was in fact shown the picture a year before the tv interview and that she didn’t recognize her son at that time. Her ex-husband, Rudi Heyrman and the father of Ken confirms he was shown the photo and that he indeed didn’t recognize Ken. Tinny says that he hadn’t seen Ken for years before his disappearance ( because they had been divorced already for some time) so that it would make sense that he wouldn’t recognize him if he were even older. This lead is quite similar to one of the leads in Katrien de Cuyper’s case. She was last seen at a bar where, as it turned out later in the Zandvoort investigation in 1998, a porn photo studio was located on the second floor. There is a theory that Katrien was abused there at a younger age before disappearing. This location is very close to where Kim & Ken were last seen and where Kim’s body was found. It’s weird that in Katrien’s case, we have a CP picture that looks just like her only when she was younger then when she disappeared while with Ken, we have the exact opposite. The actual photo shown to the parents is not found anywhere so I can’t link to it unfortunately. Tinny claims she showed it to friends and family and they all agreed it was Ken . **June 1999: Steve Vissers abduction & murder** Another very sad case in the exact same area. On June 24th 1999, 12-year old Steve Vissers is riding his new bike along with his 9-year old brother Sven. Danny Immens, a 29- year old painter hits Steve intentionally with his moped. He forces Steve to sit on the back of his moped at knifepoint and scares his younger brother away. He drives off with the boy to a field where he rapes and murders him. At that time, police was already on their way because the younger brother Sven ran to a convenience store where they called the cops. Unfortunately, they were too late because Steve’s body was found mere hours later. Danny Immens was arrested the next day and confessed the murder. At that time, he was living a steady life with his girlfriend and a 4 year old son. He was interrogated as well with regards to the Kim & Ken case but they could never found any evidence. His DNA was compared to DNA found on Kim’s body but it came back negative. Nevertheless, Tinny is now convinced that Danny Immens is the murderer of her children. He was sentenced in 2000 to life in prison for the murder of Steve Vissers. During his trial, psychiatrists warned that he was a very dangerous sexual predator, who will start killing again as soon as he got out of prison. It is reported that during the reconstruction scenes ( where he had to show the jury how he killed Steve) he had an erection. Tinny was present for everyday of his trial, giving interviews stating that she knows he killed her children as well. She does has some compelling points \- He lived very close to the area where Kim & Ken lived. The place where he abducted Steve is only a mile or so from the place where Kim& Ken where last seen \- The modus operandi is very similar: two kids targeted in broad daylight, same ages of the children, the use of a knife, the sexual assault, the location,… \- On the day the K& K went missing, Danny returned some movies to a rental shop right in that area, so we know he was there around the time. \- Tinny claims that they found the markings on Kim’s behind as with Steve. She claims this is proof she was also transported on the same moped. I do think this might be a stretch, seeing as her body was 5 weeks in the water before she was found. I don’t think any moped can leave such permanent markings? Things that don’t point to Danny Immens as the killer: \- Why would he abduct two kids in 1994 and then just one in 1999? Apparently he didn’t have a car so I can imagine it would be hard to abduct two children in broad daylight on a moped? However, when he abducted Steve, it is reported he tried to invite other kids to take a ride on his moped. The other kids all refused. Remember, this was after Dutroux when kids where taught not to go with strangers. Maybe when offered a ride in 1994, by a 25-year old Danny Immens, Kim & Ken would have said yes? That way he could have taken them one by one. \- The abduction of Steve in 1999 seems very impulsive, not really planned. He didn’t have a \- place to go to ( he has a girlfriend and child at home) and he must have known the younger brother would alert people. It all seemed very rushed and sloppy. Although maybe in 1994, 5 years earlier he didn’t have a kid yet and maybe he was living on his own. \- Danny just doesn’t seem like a ‘ mastermind’ criminal, given that he confessed Steve’s murder immediately after he was arrested. Why wouldn’t he confess the other case as well? He doesn’t seem like somebody who wouldn’t crack while interrogated for months. \- He was cleared trough DNA testing – This is most damning point for Tinny’s theory. She still believes it’s him because there was only a very tiny fraction of DNA to be tested on Kim’s body ( after 5 weeks in the water) and thinks the test is a false negative. **Criticism on the police investigation:** Tinny is furious for the lack of active response when her children went missing and the later investigation. She didn’t get any insight or access to the full file. She didn’t get to see the autopsy photo’s of Kim ( they were deemed to horrifying) and wasn’t kept in the loop of possible suspects. She fought hard with, blaming them in interviews. Once she even stood in front of the police station with a banner saying ‘ Byttebier, what are you doing here?’ ( Byttebier was the name of the investigating judge on the case who decided she couldn’t see the pictures or get access to the files). She once even went on a hunger strike for eleven days to force the police to give her access to whole casefile. In the end, our minister of justice went to talk to her and she did gain access after all, I believe years later. She also claims a lot of suspects were barely questioned. **Conclusion:** What do you think of this? Is the real killer Danny Immens, who is in prison for the murder of Steve Vissers? Is there a link with the Zandvoort Scandal? I’m not convinced one way or the other. I think Tinny wants answers so badly she’s clinging to every schred of hope, ignoring all the evidence that doesn’t line up. Like in 1998, she’s completely convinced that Ken is an a pedo-ring, claiming she’s never seen the CP photo before while the police and her ex-husband claim she did saw that picture earlier. A year later, she’s completely convinced that it’s Danny Immens, ignoring a DNA test that didn’t match. I feel so bad for Tinny while researching all of this. She probably already didn’t have an easy life to begin with, being an teen mom. How powerless she must have felt when her kids went missing, being pregnant at the time, the police not believing her, having a miscarriage… She was slandered by the police who didn’t like her doing her own investigation and talking with the press that much. Later she was also attacked in the media by her ex-husband Rudi Heyrman ( who taught she was partly responsible for letting the kids go out by themselves). She kind of reminds of the mom in *Three billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri.* She still gives interviews regularly ( mostly around the anniversary of the disappearance). Her only hope for the future is that she finds out exactly what happened to her children, 26 years ago. I do hope she find answers one day. There is an older post here on reddit [https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/budwxz/he\_sent\_an\_anonymous\_letter\_to\_the\_prosecutor/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/budwxz/he_sent_an_anonymous_letter_to_the_prosecutor/) which mainly focused on the father/ adoptive father. The consensus in that thread seems to be that the father did it, but there are a lot of mistakes. The main source seems to be a French Wikipedia article which is full of errors ( for example, the name of the father was Rudi Heyrman and not Manuel). They botched the names of the different (step)fathers and turned them into 1 person. ( Rudi Heyrman and Manuel Lanssens) It seems to be taken from an article in le Soir from 1994 where both parents names are wrong ( Tinny Mast is called Tinny Delaporte) so I wouldn’t give much credit to the other details. In other media, there is no mention of an anonymous letter or a suicide attempt by the father. There is actually not much info to be found about Manuel Lanssens, Kim & Kens stepfather who was living with them at the moment. He was always in the background, not coming forward in the spotlight like Tinny. They divorced in 1997, three years after the disappearance. I would assume his DNA was compared as well in this case. Tinny also never seemed to suspect him so I doubt there's anything there. She did gain full custody over their son Axel after the divorce, but no details can be found about that.

712,"Why Anna Will Never Leave Josh**Why Anna Will Never Leave Josh** Consider this an addendum to my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DuggarsSnark/comments/bvrwkc/an_examination_of_the_duggars_belief_system/) regarding the Duggars’ belief system. If you’re wanting more detail on the insane church they follow, you might want to give it a read. Pretty much everyone here thinks that Anna should have left Josh when the molestation scandal broke and should have taken her brother up on his offer of help. I see a lot of posts implying that she’s stupid but, given the church the Duggars belong to, it’s not quite that easy. Those of us making those comments tend to be looking at the situation from the outside in and don’t know the half of what Anna’s going through. This isn’t meant to defend her, per say, it’s more to explain just why it’s so hard for her to get out. **Indoctrination and Educational Neglect** We can all agree that the school of the dining room table is woefully inadequate. The Kellers are known to have home schooled their children but I wasn’t able to find much about the methods they used. I would be willing to wager a guess though that they used the IBLP’s Wisdom Booklets as source material. Homeschoolers Anonymous has an archive of them [here.](https://homeschoolersanonymous.org/2015/05/31/wisdom-booklet-archive-index/) It’s possible they may have used Abeka or ACE but even those would probably be a disaster, as evidenced by a [Redditor who posted about their experience with ACE.](https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/797v9q/accelerated_christian_education_is_a_disaster/) These curricula are extremely heavy-handed with the idea that Jesus is the answer to everything and are littered with Bible verses. Even subjects like math or geography have a religious bent to them. If you read any of the Wisdom Booklets, it’s easy to see that what’s taught isn’t conducive to creating critical thinking skills. IFB children are simply expected to memorize and regurgitate material in order to keep them compliant and God-fearing. According to [Fundamentalists Wiki](https://fundamentalists.fandom.com/wiki/Anna_Duggar), Anna completed high school at the age of 16 and then enrolled in online Christian college for a degree in Early Childhood Education. However, this differs from Josh and Anna’s [old website,](https://web.archive.org/web/20130103081635/Ja20.com/ourstory.html) which says that she has a degree in Christian Education. Given the differing reports, and that I can’t find a source naming the college she attended, I’m willing to bet it was something along the lines of a fundamentalist diploma mill. Add to this the fact that fundie girls are generally given less education than their male counterparts, especially on things that won’t be used for marriage or child-rearing, and it’s obvious that Anna is unable to properly think for herself. She’s been “educated” with the idea that her sole purpose in life is to be a “helpmeet”, making her subservient to the men in her life and unable to do anything but trust their judgement. **Abuse at Home** The way children are raised in the IFB church often involves physical, emotional, and, in some cases, sexual abuse. Children are expected to obey their parents at all times and not doing so is grounds for corporal punishment. Proverbs 22:6 says “Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.” Children are thought to be born sinners with a naturally rebellious nature, which makes it the parents’ job to discipline that out of them in order to make them proper Christians. I can’t find any information on the discipline methods used by Anna’s parents, but I did find a few articles (one of them being [People](https://people.com/tv/anna-duggar-all-about-josh-duggars-wife-and-her-extreme-parents/)), although their source is anonymous) that mentioned the Kellers being stricter than the Duggars when it came to raising their children. **Physical Abuse** Physical abuse in the IFB church tends to stem from a few of these fun Bible verses. Since the members of this church take the Bible literally, they understand them as meaning that it’s a good thing to beat your child. This is just a sampling but there are many more you can dig up if you’re interested. * He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes. (Proverbs 13:24) * Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die. Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell. (Proverbs 23:13,14) * Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him. (Proverbs 22:15) * The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame. (Proverbs 29:15) * A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool’s back. (Proverbs 26:3) * The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripes the inward parts of the belly. (Proverbs 20:30) * Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord. (Colossians 3:20) IFB parents don’t believe in the modern ways of disciplining children. Grounding children, taking their toys away, or revoking their video game privileges doesn’t fall under “Biblical discipline”. These people don’t just want their kids to behave, they want complete and total obedience practiced with a smile. Parents in the IFB will often speak about “spanking” but it’s really more like beating. Let’s take a look at some prominent members of the IFB, known for advocating that physical abuse is the path to keeping kids on the straight and narrow. **Bill Gothard** I can’t say for 100% certain that the Kellers were followers of Gothard but since they ran in the same homeschooling circles as the Duggars, they probably followed his teachings. The Duggars are definitely the cliquey sort who would never associate with anyone following a different version of Christianity or pastor unless it was to try and convert them. Gothard is the founder of the Institute in Basic Life Principles (IBLP). You can read the carefully sanitized version of his life on the IBLP’s website [here](https://iblp.org/about-iblp/iblp-history) and [here](https://iblp.org/about-iblp/iblp-history/bill-gothard). To make a long story short, he was a hardcore conservative Christian who created his own cult, gained enough followers for it to thrive, and eventually it became even bigger when his supporters began to number people like the Duggars, Rick Perry (former governor of Texas), Jim Leininger (part owner of the San Antonio Spurs), Mike Huckabee (a former presidential candidate), and Sarah Palin. Eventually it all came crashing down when Gothard was accused of sexually abusing 34 women over a period of more than 40 years. An internal investigation supposedly uncovered no wrong-doing but he was ousted from the IBLP’s leadership. I’ve scoured the internet for any sort of quotes connecting Gothard to child abuse outright, but he seems to keep everything wrapped up in carefully coded religious language. >Your children must understand that as long as they are under your authority, they are protected from destructive temptation. However, if they get out from under your authority, they expose themselves to the realm and power of Satan’s control. (See 1 Samuel 15:23.) this requires that you have no ‘leaks’ in your umbrella and that you never instruct your children to do evil. >Even after the parents release their son or daughter into adulthood, the parents’ counsel should be sought and carefully considered. Scripture warns us to value the instructions of our parents and not to forsake the counsel of parents when they are old. (See Proverbs 6:20–24 and 23:22.) However, what is easy to find is an [article](https://spiritualsoundingboard.com/2015/03/26/man-shares-personal-testimony-of-how-bill-gothard-used-bible-verses-which-led-to-the-abuse-of-children/) where a man who has met Gothard in person speaks about the horrid abuse he endured as a child. >Specifically, I’d like to talk about those aspects of Gothard’s teachings which were protocols for physical abuse: examples include blanket training, beating children with rods, and the sheer exasperation of parents whose children failed the rules of the program which would result in explosions of rage and indiscriminate hitting. In particular, Gothard’s distortions of the following verse were extremely detrimental: >Proverbs 23:13- Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die. >Gothard devoted a great deal of written material, both IBLP and ATI, to using this verse as a premise for encouraging brutal beatings, albeit using roundabout phrasing and “soft” language which absolved him legally of any actual responsibility. At least, that’s how my parents interpreted it. >On the few occasions when I met Gothard in person, he actually stated that he believed spanking made children healthier and more successful. He would then quote the proverb about beating. He was very good about mincing words in order to evade responsibility. >I believe Gothard does in fact intend for parents to beat their children. I would argue that anyone who claims to have had a good experience with Gothard, IBLP, or ATI is either lying, deluded, or sadists themselves. If you got 4-5 years into ATI and you actually applied everything in the publications that Gothard sent you, especially the material based on Proverbs 23:13, you would have had an identical experience to mine. **Michael and Debbie Pearl** The Pearls are arguably the most famous child abuse apologists in the IFB church. You might have heard of their book, *To Train Up a Child*. This is the book that has lead to multiple child murders, committed by strict Evangelical parents, who not only took the Pearl’s methods at face value but went above and beyond in torturing their children. The most well known of these cases is the death of [Hana Williams](http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2013/11/hana_williams_the_tragic_death_of_an_ethiopian_adoptee_and_how_it_could.html), an adoptee from Ethiopia who ended up with a strict, homeschooling Evangelical family unequipped to deal with the needs of a child experiencing culture shock. *To Train Up a Child* is immensely popular with the fundie set. The Duggars actually promoted it on their website until it began to gain a scandalous reputation, then removed any trace of it. Again, since the Duggars and the Kellers were friendly with each other before Josh and Anna’s marriage, I’m going to speculate that they might have read it. The book was published in 1994. Anna would have been 6 years old but Gothard would have been promoting child abuse long before then, giving the Pearls plenty of fodder for their book. Let’s pull some quotes from their book (first edition): * One particularly painful experience of nursing mothers is the biting baby. My wife did not waste time finding a cure. When the baby bit, she pulled hair (an alternative has to be sought for baldheaded babies). Understand, the baby is not being punished, just conditioned. * A spanking (whipping, paddling, switching, belting) is indispensable to the removal of guilt in your child. His very conscience (nature) demands punishment. * Stripes (""scourgeth"" Heb. 12:6) are said to be to the soul what the healing blood flow is to a wound. A child properly and timely spanked is healed in the soul and restored to wholeness of spirit. A child can be turned back from the road to hell through proper spankings. * She then administers about ten slow, patient licks on his bare legs. He cries in pain. If he continues to show defiance by jerking around and defending himself, or by expressing anger, then she will wait a moment and again lecture him and again spank him. * On the bare legs or bottom, switch him eight or ten licks; then, while waiting for the pain to subside, speak calm words of rebuke. If the crying turns to a true, wounded, submissive whimper, you have conquered; he has submitted his will. If the crying is still defiant, protesting and other than a response to pain, spank him again. If this is the first time he has come up against someone tougher than he, it may take a while. He must be convinced that you have truly altered your expectations. * If they are mad, switch them. Don't let your child stay unhappy. Meet the real needs and make their selfish crying an unrewarding experience. * Don't think of the rod as a weapon of defense or a show of force; think of the rod as a ""magic wand."" * If you have to sit on him to spank him then do not hesitate. And hold him there until he is surrendered. Prove that you are bigger, tougher, more patiently enduring and are unmoved by his wailing. Defeat him totally. Accept no conditions for surrender. No compromise. You are to rule over him as a benevolent sovereign. Your word is final. * Select your instrument according to the child's size. For the under one year old, a little, ten- to twelve-inch long, willowy branch (striped of any knots that might break the skin) about one-eighth inch diameter is sufficient. Sometimes alternatives have to be sought. A one-foot ruler, or its equivalent in a paddle, is a sufficient alternative. For the larger child, a belt or larger tree branch is effective. **Emotional and Psychological Abuse** Physical abuse is rampant within the IFB and along with that comes other forms, such as emotional and psychological abuse. Emotional abuse generally involves things like an abuser destroying their victim’s self esteem, withholding affection, disparaging their victim in front of others, and invading their privacy. Psychological abuse is typically characterized by distorting the victim’s sense of reality, called gaslighting. This is done with the intention of undermining a victim’s confidence, setting the stage for making their victim easier to control. One of the few things I was able to find about the Kellers was that they have some bizarre rules about the expression of emotions. If what’s been reported is true, Anna was only given [15 minutes per week](https://people.com/tv/anna-duggar-all-about-josh-duggars-wife-and-her-extreme-parents/) to talk to her mother one-on-one. Some of the signs of a child who has experienced [emotional neglect](https://drjonicewebb.com/answering-the-question-how-does-emotional-neglect-affect-a-child/) are: * The child receives the message that all or some of his feelings and emotional needs are not tolerated or accepted in his childhood home. (The Kellers only giving each child 15 minutes per week to discuss things that may be important to them. As well, she would have been told that her emotions were not as important as those of the men in her life. ) * The child builds a wall to block off her emotions, so as not to burden her parents. (Anna’s been told that having a joyful countenance at all times is important. Also, with so many kids in the house, she may have felt that her mother was too busy to have any time for her outside of the 15 minutes a week she’d normally get.) * The child realizes that he is alone in the world, and must solve his own problems and meet his own needs. (Anna learns to keep everything inside, hidden behind her vacant eyes and cheery smile.) * Likely the child’s parents do come through for him emotionally sometimes, in certain situations. (Anna insists that she had a great childhood.) * The child grows up recalling the times her parents were there for him. She has little to no awareness of the endless everyday moments when her joy was killed, her anger squelched or her needs ignored. (Most likely, Anna thinks that there was nothing wrong with the way she grew up and her religion has drilled it into her that experiencing abuse from your parents is normal.) Gothard also has some teachings about emotions that are bizarre and very damaging to anyone who was forced to grow up with them. Sourced from Gothard’s [Embassy Media site workbooks:](https://embassymedia.com/speaker/bill-gothard) * Anger - According to Gothard, anger is for God and God alone. Allowing yourself to get angry is taking over God’s job and not letting him deal with the people who have hurt you. For humans, anger = sin. >Many people use wrath to punish those who have hurt them. Thus, they are taking upon themselves a duty that belongs to only God. He has stated, “Vengeance is mine; I will repay” (Romans 12:19). Rather than bringing vengeance on others through our wrath, we should extend forgiveness and help where appropriate. In this way, we fulfill the instruction “Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good” (Romans 12:21). When we usurp the authority of God by meting out vengeance, we actually damage ourselves because of the physical consequences. >It is significant to note Ephesians 4:26 in context of the verse that follows: “Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath: Neither give place to the devil” (Ephesians 4:26–27). The initial emotion of anger is not sin, but if the anger is expressed or allowed to continue and deepen into wrath, it becomes sin, and Satan is given a foothold. * Pride - one of Gothard’s teachings on pride says “Pride is reserving for myself the right to make final decisions and not submitting to the direction of God-given authority.” I am willing to bet this phrase is used to punish women who decide that they want to be in control of their own life. A woman who doesn’t submit to her father or husband is “prideful” and thus a sinner. * Slothfulness - According to Gothard, slothful people are lazy and spend all of their time sleeping. There is no acknowledgement that someone who sleeps all the time may be experiencing depression. Being slothful is entirely a moral failing that one day a person will answer for. “The slothful person does not consider that he must one day give account to God for the way he has used his time. He sees nightfall as a justifiable reason for sleep, not for examining whether or not he has earned it.” * Fear - “The opposite of having a meek and quiet spirit is giving way to fear and worry. Fear is not of God, nor has He given us the spirit of fear. (See II Timothy 1:7.) Therefore, fear is from our adversary, the devil.” Apparently it’s ungodly to be afraid because that opens you up to Satan, who will plant doubts against God inside of you. * Jealousy - Gothard has decided that jealousy is not a sin, but only when it’s applied to marriage. Jealousy is “part of God’s design for marriage”, illustrated with this bible verse: >“When the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he be jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the LORD” (Numbers 5:30). Naturally, this is also tied somehow to punishing women by using a bible verse. >God made provision in the Old Testament for dealing with a jealous spirit. If a husband feels that his wife is delighting in another man, he is to confront her. If she denies any wrongdoing, he is to take her to the priests, who are to follow certain guidelines to confirm or reject the validity of the husband’s jealousy. “If any man’s wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him, And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no witness against her, neither she be taken with the manner; And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled: Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest . . .” (Numbers 5:12–15). Psychologically, the IFB church does a number on people, especially those who have been raised that way, like Anna. The church uses fear to control its members, making the threat of hell sound very real to them. According, to Gothard, God is not loving and caring; he is someone to be feared: >Each of us will give an account of our lives to God, and He is fully aware of everything we think, desire, speak, and do. The fear of the Lord is an awareness of these truths. It can be defined as a continual awareness that you are in the presence of a holy, just, and almighty God, and that every motive, thought, word, and action is open before Him and will be judged by Him. If God knows everything you are doing, thinking, and feeling, there is no escape. Even just the thought of divorce or leaving the church can be grounds for being pitched into hell, creating an invisible prison. Gothard also preaches that humans are naturally imperfect and sinful. >We do not naturally seek to honor God, because our sinful natures lead us to pursue selfish pleasures instead of delighting in God and discovering the joy of knowing and loving Him. We must choose to walk in the fear of the Lord. If you are not perfect and have a tendency to give in to sin, it’s pretty much guaranteed that you’ll make mistakes at some point. That means you have to be ever vigilant to guard against going to hell. IFB members live an exhausting life of policing themselves to make sure that they are virtuous enough to please God. Fear of the outside world is also used as a tool to keep IFB members compliant. They are told that the secular world is an evil, Godless place where everyone is going to hell. Anything and everything secular can be used as a tool of Satan to lure people away from the church, as illustrated in Jocelyn Zichterman’s book, I Fired God. >Our pastors warned us constantly about the evils that lay just beyond our church doors to reinforce the psychology of suspicion, fear, and alienation. They said plastic toy trolls, like Smurfs, would bring evil spirits into our homes and Cabbage Patch dolls would lead us into witchcraft. IFB pastors also preached entire sermons on the evils of the television set. In the 1970s and 1980s, television-smashing sessions came into vogue. The pastor would tell the church members who wanted to rid their homes of evil to come to worship prepared to destroy their television sets. I can still remember watching fathers, many of whom had worked long and hard to save up for a television, lugging their sets out of their cars after Sunday services and hurling them onto the pavement behind the church. Then they would use baseball bats to smash the TVs to pieces. Pastors in the IFB church hold a lot of power. They are easily able to manipulate a congregation of people who think the man in the pulpit has a direct line to God. Corrupt pastors often appoint deacons who are willing to impose whatever insane rules they come up with, which makes it easy to drive out any church member who might sow seeds of doubt. According to Jocelyn Zichterman: >The powerful men who run the IFB believe that the only way to maintain members’ fear of the Lord (and, by extension, effective control over them) is by, first, convincing them to fear and respect the pastor in each IFB church, and, second, convincing them to fear and respect the father or husband in each home. It’s not a stretch then to see just how afraid Anna may be. With the threat of hell constantly looming over her head, she is stuck in an invisible prison. When this is coupled with the fear of leaving her entire life behind, never to see it again, we can realize that leaving is much more daunting than people in the secular world make it out to be. Telling someone who’s had fear instilled into them their entire life to “just leave” isn’t going to do any good. Unless Anna is able to break those mental chains she will remain rooted into her current lifestyle. **Mental Illness** Conveniently, Gothard teaches that mental illness is the sufferer’s own fault and is a manifestation of sin. He opposes psychiatry and psychology, stating that they make people worse and have roots in secular humanism. He also doesn’t believe in taking antidepressants. This is detailed on his personal website, [billgothard.com](https://billgothard.com/ministry/): >Researchers point out that low or imbalanced serotonin levels result in anger, anxiety, addictions, depression and thoughts of suicide. The whole purpose of antidepressants is to keep serotonin in the brain. An antidepressant is called a “Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor” (SSRI). The first problem with this pharmaceutical approach is that only 5% of our serotonin is produced in the brain while 95% is produced in our “gut brain,” which God (in the Old Testament Scriptures) calls our “reins.” >The second (and more major) problem with antidepressants is that they have very damaging side-effects including depression, aggression and suicidal thoughts. It is extremely significant that 35 of the killers in mass school shootings in recent years were all on, or were withdrawing from, antidepressants. He goes on to declare that the only way for people to raise their serotonin levels is to read and memorize scripture every day. Supposedly, this is also the cure for keeping people from a life of crime. Gothard even tackles suicide. Here are his 4 types: * Mental suicide: This involves taking any sort of drugs, “decreasing mental responsibilities”, and leaving Christ out of your life. The prescribed “treatment” is fasting and memorizing scripture. * Moral suicide: Letting evil into your life, specifically lust. The cure for this is supposedly reading Galatians 6:7. * Spiritual Suicide: Rejection of God’s word, immorality, and Satanic worship. This is said to cause “irrational fears, unexplained nervousness, illogical, fragmented thinking, and inability to respond to God”. The treatment for this one is confession and “claim the blood and name of the Lord Jesus Christ”, whatever that is. * Physical suicide: Actually killing yourself. It’s very possible that Anna may have suffered from physical or emotional abuse at the hands of her parents, or at the very least, emotional neglect. The long lasting impact of it, coupled with the patriarchal cult she grew up in, may have taught her that her needs and wants don’t matter. She is to be a submissive god-fearing wife who supports her husband at any cost, all the while supporting the cheerful “countenance” that Gothard likes to push. She may also be suffering from mental illness but is unable to seek help. **IFB Views on Marriage** According to [Gothard](https://iblp.org/questions/how-courtship-different-dating), “Courtship is a relationship between a man and a woman in which they seek to determine if it is God’s will for them to marry each other. Under the protection, guidance, and blessing of parents or mentors, the couple concentrates on developing a deep friendship that could lead to marriage, as they discern their readiness for marriage and God’s timing for their marriage.” What this boils down to is that people aren’t allowed to date around in order to find the person they’re supposed to spend the rest of their life with. They’re supposed to “court” with the idea of marriage immediately in mind. As the Duggars are fond of saying, dating “gives away pieces of your heart”. It also supposedly leads to intimacy every time, destroying a woman’s purity and ruining her for her future husband. Couples who court are never allowed to be alone together. As we’ve seen of Josh and Anna’s courtship, they were constantly chaperoned and were not allowed to do things that normal couples do, such as going on dates alone, kissing, and hugging from the front. They were allowed to hold hands once engaged though. As you can see in [this video](https://youtu.be/npxjuh6UyT4?t=30) they basically took hand holding to a creepy new level, bordering on some sort of porn. Once married, Anna would be expected to fit the role of a submissive “helpmeet” in order to be a good wife. According to Gothard, men have [seven basic needs](https://iblp.org/questions/what-are-my-spouses-basic-needs) with [specific ways to fulfill them](https://iblp.org/questions/how-can-i-meet-my-husbands-basic-needs): *A man needs a wife who is loyal and supportive* It’s a wife’s job to help her husband achieve the goals and priorities he sets for the family. She is also supposed to demonstrate loyalty to him by “seeking [his] guidance and counsel first, especially in regard to family issues…” According to Gothard, “A foolish wife will crush her husband’s spirit by resisting his decisions, and God will hold her accountable for disobedience to His instructions. (See Ephesians 5:22-24.)” Anna may be terrified of being thought of as disobedient so she continues to allow Josh to lead the family, even though he has proven himself to be a failure as a husband. *A man needs a wife who honors his leadership.* A wife is supposed to revere her husband, to “honor, esteem, appreciate, prize, and in the human sense, to adore him, that is to admire, praise, be devoted to, deeply love, and enjoy him.” Submission to him is considered to be a reflection of the wife’s faith in God. There is even a specific biblical example on the IBLP website. >For example, Abraham failed to protect his wife Sarah (see Genesis 12:10-20 and Genesis 20), yet she still “obeyed Abraham, calling him lord” (I Peter 3:6a). Sarah trusted God to meet her needs through her authority (Abraham), and God worked supernaturally on Sarah’s behalf to protect her from harm. That verse goes on to exhort all wives to follow her example: “. . . Whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well [“be a well-doer . . . as a duty”], and are not afraid with any amazement” (I Peter 3:6b). > A foolish wife can—either unknowingly or deliberately—crush her husband’s spirit by making foolish choices. For example, if you seek to be financially independent, your self-sufficiency can crush your husband’s spirit. God gave your husband the responsibility to provide for his family. A wise wife will trust God to provide for her family’s needs through her husband’s leadership. It’s been drilled into Anna’s head that she shouldn’t undermine Josh’s leadership. As a submissive wife, she is supposed to trust Josh, no matter how insane his decisions happen to be, otherwise she will destroy his fragile ego. Leaving would also mean that Anna would have to find a way of supporting herself and her children and, in turn, be seen as turning her back on God. Having never worked a day in her life, this would be a daunting prospect for her. *A man needs a wife who develops inward and outward beauty.* Inward beauty appears to be having a “meek and quiet” spirit by trusting her husband and God, while outward beauty means that a wife should make sure her appearance pleases her husband at all times. Wives are supposed to dress and do their hair the way their husband likes. She should also have a “a joyful countenance and select clothing that draws attention to it.” There’s also this lovely passage on the IBLP website about dieting: >God is concerned about the bondage of overeating and gluttony, and many wives struggle with the issue of self-control, especially after giving birth to children. Weight control requires consistent conformity to God’s principles of living. >Let God and your husband know you care about your weight. Ask your husband to help you identify and remove hindrances to weight control, such as unhealthy foods, poor meal schedules, medical problems, or bitterness. Work together to accomplish specific goals. Your efforts to stay healthy and physically fit will bless your husband. This is why Anna appears pretty much the same after 6 pregnancies while Josh has ballooned to the point that he’s beginning to resemble a blob of tater tot casserole. *A man needs a wife who will make appeals, not demands.* Demands are apparently asking your husband to treat you like an equal partner in the relationship when it comes to decision making. Women are supposed to “guard your heart and your mouth” because it can bring dishonor to the man at a later date. A wife is to “ wait for the right timing to present the appeal, and then respond to his final decision with a meek and quiet spirit”. So Anna can tell Josh not to be an idiot but it has to be in the nicest way possible. She’s also required to accept whatever decision he makes, even if it’s a stupid ass decision, because as a man his word is law. *A man needs a wife who understands his need for time alone with God.* >A man needs time to be alone with the Lord. If you react and feel rejected when your husband takes time to be alone with the Lord, you will frustrate him. Apparently Josh is allowed to tell Anna to leave him alone whenever he wishes “because God” but she is always required to be joyfully available. *A man needs a grateful wife.* >Expectations destroy gratefulness. Gratefulness is the basis of joyfulness, and a joyful wife is a crown to her husband. (See Proverbs 12:4.) An unhappy wife is a public rebuke to him. A husband feels like a prisoner of his wife’s expectations if she does not release them to the Lord. (See Psalm 62:5.) Reading this makes me think that this is the reason for Anna’s strained smiles in all of her pictures with Josh. She’s not allowed to be unhappy, even when she’s been publicly humiliated. This definitely feeds into the idea of having a joyful countenance as well. *A man needs a wife who will be praised by others.* >You can become a virtuous wife, doing your husband good and not evil all the days of his life. As you meet your husband’s needs, you will bring glory to God, and the heart of your husband will trust in you. Your husband will “rejoice in the wife of his youth!” This is a reference to the [Proverbs 31](http://web.mit.edu/jywang/www/cef/Bible/NIV/NIV_Bible/PROV+31.html) woman that fundies love to talk about. Poor Anna is being held to an impossible standard while Josh seemingly does whatever he wants. He might be condemned in the court of public opinion but he has faced no real consequences within his religious community or legally. **The Umbrella of Protection** Gothard preaches that the ideal family structure falls under the [Umbrella of Protection](https://imgur.com/0aDrbyl). God protects man and, in turn, man protects his wife, who protects the children they have. Everyone within this structure, save for God, has an authority that they must obey. According to Gothard, complete and total obedience to authority is required in order to avoid hell. The IBLP website says: >The concept of an umbrella of protection is illustrated in what the prophet Samuel said to Israel’s King Saul when Saul disobeyed God’s instructions: “Rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft” (I Samuel 15:23). Those who participate in witchcraft directly interact with destructive, satanic influences. Rebellion is similar, because through disobedience you remove yourself from God’s full protection and are therefore far more susceptible to the attacks of Satan. The message to women is clear: disobey your husband and you risk going to hell. Women are also told that they have the potential to drag their children down with them, something which must be terrifying to someone like Anna, who has spent her entire life being abused and indoctrinated. **How the IFB Views Infidelity** According to Gothard, forgiveness is not just important, it’s pretty much a requirement. Anyone who can’t forgive their abuser is considered to be filled with “bitterness”. In the IFB this is considered a sin, as a real Christian would find it in their heart to completely ignore what’s been done to them and move on as if the offense never happened. As stated above, punishment is to be meted out by God instead of the person who has been wronged. A person who holds bitterness in their heart is guaranteed by Gothard to experience mental, physical, and spiritual consequences. These can include depression, stress, being unable to focus, an “inability to love God”, and hindering the spiritual development of others around you. On the IBLP website it says that resolving bitterness requires putting faith in both God and the person who has offended you and asking God to help you forgive. From the IBLP website: >When we experience abuse from others, our natural response is to strike back. Pride prompts us to return hurt for hurt and insult for insult. However, God instructs us to love our enemies: “Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you” (Matthew 5:43-44; see also Luke 6:27-29). Now let’s take a look at some quotes on marriage from [Wisdom Booklet 26,](https://homeschoolersanonymous.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/wisdom-booklet-26-p-1191-1254.pdf) another one of Gothard’s “teaching materials”. * The spirit of the marriage covenant is unconditional commitment, “for better or for worse, til death do us part.” This spirit is violated when conditions are placed upon the covenant. * The spirit of marriage is to be one of love which is forgiving and long suffering. The provisions for divorce were created because of the hardness of people’s hearts who did not know how to love. * When divorce is carried out between two believers, they violate Scripture by going to law before the unbelievers. (See I Corinthians 6:1-9.) They demonstrate hardness of heart and an unforgiving spirit. * Divorce produces guilt and bitterness and causes the parties to break the vows they made to each other and to God. * Probably most grievous of all is the fact that divorce damages the children of a marriage. This not only offends the little ones, but hinders the development of Godly seed. Both these actions carry severe penalties from the Lord. * When two people enter into a marriage, each one is to yield personal rights for the benefit of the other. * God’s commandments prohibiting divorce and remarriage are designed to protect our happiness, not to prohibit it. *For a Christian to say that marriage is irreconcilable is to deny the very nature of the God in whom he or she claims to believe. On the [IBLP website:](http://mailings.iblp.org/getresponse/output/index.php?day=227) >Divorce is never a solution; it is only choosing another set of problems. >As much as divorced parents try to avoid offending and damaging their children, it is unavoidable. A child's initial perception of God is based largely on his experiences with his parents. When parents divorce, they are displaying attitudes and actions that are contrary to the nature of God. This can lead their children to have a distorted view of God, which can have serious and devastating repercussions in their lives. Many children from broken homes picture God as someone Who is distant and uninterested in their daily lives, a God Who will leave them during hard times, or as an angry, harsh God Who watches for things that He can punish. Yet again we see the salvation of a woman’s children being used to manipulate her into compliance. Anna is probably terrified of condemning her children to hell. No doubt her family and church would have pressured her regarding this. **CONTINUED IN THE COMMENTS.**",
713,"Watching Picard was an emotional experience - NO SPOILERSNot a noob Trekker, but new to the community (obvs lol) greetings y'all. So I have been watching Star Trek since I was very small. My first vivid memory of television is the image of Balok's alter ego puppet in the end credits of TOS. I couldn't have been more than 4. I didn't really remember watching the show intently until I was 7. I was truly introduced to ST by my best friend Philip, who was also 7. The show has really been a major thread that has been weaved through the tapestry of my life. *cough* shamelessly stolen *cough* As I watched this amazing debut episode of the best ST Captain (we can fight about that later) getting back in the saddle, I found myself crying throughout. You see, Phil, the man (and the best friend I ever had) who introduced me to my first sci-fi show, committed suicide about a week ago. I only found out about it a few days ago. This horrible reality I've found myself in has produced about 5 strong emotions all hitting me equally at the same time. I haven't been able to process them properly because anger is at the forefront of this cascade of feelings. Until I watched Picard. As the story unfolded before me and that wonder I used to experience as a child returned, all I could think of is how Phil would have absolutely loved it. My anger subsided. And the beauty of this episode washed over me. The tears flowed. And I can now concentrate on 'gettin on' with the healing of my broken heart. People who don't get Star Trek tend to wonder why we love this universe so much. I simply smile and hope they get it some day. But there is power in the messages of hope and a future where there is far less want and need. And that translates to forward and positive thinking to the people who get the message. And act upon it. Me? I'm a simple guy who just lost his best friend. Our shared love of this show has put me back on trying to act on those messages of hope and positivism. tl;dr Picard and my love of ST is helping me get over the suicide of my best friend.",
714,"The Fertility ProjectYou may have asked yourself at least once in your life - if you could go back in time, what would you change? I never contemplated that question until recently and now I think about it every day, regret my decision to ever join that damned experiment. If I knew then what I knew now, I would have taken the pencil from Richards’ desk and stabbed him in the neck over and over until he died. Jailtime would be a small price to pay for that. Let me take it from the top. I work as an assistant in genetics at a college, which you may not have heard of before. Either way, to keep things safe, I won’t disclose any important information, to protect myself and anyone else who may be somehow related to the matter. Professor Richards was a prominent person in the college, adored by both students and his coworkers, for his dedication to work, extensive knowledge and ability to motivate his attendees to contribute in the lessons and outside of them. He often conducted projects here and there, small experiments to prove or debunk a theory or something else, and more often than not, he had a plethora of student-volunteers who were willing to do all the work for him. I rarely participated in any of the projects, save for when it really piqued my interest on a matter that I wanted to see the results on. Richards trusted me the most and always gave me the most sensitive tasks to perform, passing on his own knowledge onto me in the process. More often than not, he was like a fatherly figure to me, rather than a superior. He could probably sense that I grew up without a father’s love, so he stepped in to take me under his wing. Now when I look back, I start to realize that he probably never really cared, but needed someone that he could use for his twisted, insidious intentions. It all started a few months ago when he invited me to his office with a proposal he was very excited about. “How would you like to be a part of history. Victor?” He asked me. Of course I was always willing to take up big projects, especially if there was a chance for recognition, so I immediately answered ‘yes’. “Well, we have one big project upcoming.” Richards said “The biggest one yet. If everything goes well with it, we’ll be famous and rich. You’ll never have to work as an assistant another day in your life!” I asked him what this was about and he handed me a folder. When I opened it, I saw with big, bold letters the name *THE FERTILITY PROJECT*. In short, the documents described what the project would be about, who would participate and how long it would last. The purpose of the project was simple – find female test subjects that were unable to conceive children and artificially impregnate them. Aside from Richards and I, there would be twelve volunteering students from the college and five female test subjects. I carefully reviewed the documents and saw that the project was funded by the college – not that I had any suspicions about Richards’ authenticity at that time, anyway. He said that if I wanted to participate, I would have to sign an NDA and make sure not to tell anyone, under the threat of federal violation and long jail time. The same went for the students. If they told anyone about the project, including their family members, they risked getting kicked out of college and facing jailtime. Although I disliked the idea of being chained down like that, at the time it seemed like a small price to pay for such greatness. I signed it and Richards whipped out two Cuban cigars. “Been saving these for a special occasion. Doesn’t get any more special than this.” He said as he gave one to me and lit it up. I was scheduled to meet Richards in the Biology and Genetics building in two days and when I arrived, I was surprised to see a guardhouse instead of a gate and a guard sitting inside. The college had somehow managed to set this up seemingly overnight. The guard asked for my name and I gave it to him, too confused and docile at the moment to refuse. The guard politely explained that with the upcoming project, the college had to hire a security company to keep things safe. He said there were five guards in total, each stationed in a separate part of the campus, with one guard being in the Biology building at all times. I asked the guard if they knew what the project was about, but they seemed oblivious to it. All they knew was they had to keep the college grounds safe from any suspicious or violent activities. I gave him a courteous smile and left to meet Richards. When I arrived, another guard stood in front of Richards’ office and stopped me from entering. “It’s okay, he’s with me.” Richards shouted and the guard let me through. I went inside and all of the project participants were there, including the students and the five female subjects. The subjects were women between the ages of 20-28 and while Richards and I were permitted to go home at the end of the day, the students and subjects had to remain inside the building at all times. “Professor Richards, we don’t have adequate rooms for them to stay here.” I said. “Everything has been arranged.” Richards said “The students will be staying on the second floor, while the subjects will be on the third floor. Since the project is so secretive, the guard is not permitted to leave the first floor. His job here will be to prevent anyone unwanted from entering the building or in the worst-case scenario, to stop students from leaving before the project is over. Unless they sign the paper to void the contract that is, in which case they would need to refund the college for the funds provided to the project. Trust me when I say, the funds are extremely high and you probably wouldn’t want to do it. Now, let’s show you all to your rooms.” My eyes widened when we went up to the second floor and I realized that two of the classrooms have been completely rearranged into unrecognizable rooms. Instead of chairs and desks, there were night tables and beds, giving off the impression of a dorm, rather than study building. The third floor was even stranger, with the classrooms not only being rearranged, but the entire floor seemingly renovated to instead have a row of five doors, which led into tiny cells. The women were each assigned to a cell and locked. It was explained that it was for their own safety, but should they want to drop out of the experiment at any given moment, they were free to do so – again, he emphasized the price they’d have to pay for such a choice. I started getting a bad feeling by this point. None of this seemed right and no matter how many times Richards’ uttered the word ‘voluntary’, nothing seemed so about this. The students and the women seemed very enthusiastic however, and were hanging on every word the professor said, obeying orders without questions. On the first day, the crew went to the lab and created a solution, which was put into vials and injected into the subjects. Each student had his own role, ranging from performing subject check-ups, preparing food for the project members, taking blood samples, etc. My duty was to oversee the entire situation and assist if necessary, while providing medical help in case of an emergency. At around 3pm, all initial tests have been completed, so Richards instructed the students to go back to their dorm rooms, while he told me to follow him into his office. He sat by his computer, a wide grin on his face at the satisfaction of a job well done for the day. “I’ll have one task for you, Victor.” He said “You may go home whenever you want, but what I may need your help with is monitoring the subjects. Come here.” He gestured and I went around his table to look at the PC screen. On the screen were five camera feeds, monitoring the subjects’ cells. “I’ll be sleeping in the office.” He said “But if something comes up for me, I will need you to monitor the subjects.” It sounded like an order, not a request. “Sure, professor. You can count on me.” I said, trying to hide my uncertainty. “Alright. Well, that’s it for the first day. You can go home now, get some rest. We have a lot of work ahead of us tomorrow.” For days, nothing changed and the crew performed their regular duties during the day. And then about a week later, Subjects 2 and 4 started to complain about the extreme isolation they were subjected to. They asked to be let out, but Richards outright refused, reminding them about the cost they would need to pay. Despite that, Subject 2 protested, so Richards ordered one of the students to sedate her. He did as instructed and the subject fell asleep. It was around 8 pm when I went into Richards’ office to report the day’s findings and I realized that Subject 2 was still asleep. “Professor Richards, the subject should not be asleep for that long.” I said. “She shouldn’t.” He said “But she’s not sleeping. She’s been euthanized.” My eyes widened in horror. “What did you say?” I asked. “We couldn’t risk letting her out. The student doesn’t know what he did, so let’s keep it that way. We don’t want him wracking himself with guilt. “Are you out of your mind?! You killed her?!” I raised my voice, to which he gave me a stern look. “Know your place, boy.” He said “This project is the most important thing we’ll ever work on. We can’t let it go to waste because some nobody decided to opt out of it and disclose secret information.” “You can’t be serious!” I shouted. “I am.” He said “And subject 4 has been complaining as well. I am going to need you to euthanize her.” “That’s out of the question!” We had a heated discussion and I told him I’ll be leaving the project and reporting him to the police, when he whipped out the papers and showed them to me. He pointed to the section which showed that I agreed to be part of the project until it was finished and that if there came to any misconduct, all participants would be treated as equally guilty. “You son of a bitch!” I said. He simply smirked and told me to do my job, handing me the injection. I hesitated for a long time, but in the end, I had to do it. I was afraid of going to prison so much that I didn’t care if I had to end someone else’s life. That doesn’t take away from the fact that I felt extremely guilty giving the patient an injection, while lying to her face that she’d be back to her husband tomorrow by noon. Richards even made me dispose of the bodies and made me agree on a story with him to tell to the students, that the subjects were released in the middle of the night. I agreed to everything he said, feeling sick to my stomach. He told me to go home and take the next day off. I did as he commanded and needless to say, got no sleep that night. I battled with myself the entire next day on whether I should go to the authorities, but again, I was too selfish and afraid for myself to do so. When I returned to work the following day, I found Richards and the students in one of the classrooms, ecstatic. When I asked what was going on, Richards said: “Victor, we did it. Subjects 1 and 3 are pregnant. This is a huge breakthrough in science.” My jaw dropped. I honestly haven’t even thought about the potential success of the project, so I was surprised, to say the least. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t excited, myself. This was indeed a breakthrough in science. We wasted no time performing check-ups on the subjects, taking blood samples, etc. Over the next few days, the subjects’ weights have been increasing rapidly and their stomachs have grown in size. Ultrasound displayed the growth of the fetus at an abnormal rate and we started to get a little worried, since the size which we had seen by then was not supposed to be visible by the first trimester, let alone after just three weeks. Richards ordered us to carefully monitor the subjects, in case their health starts to slip up. And then came the worst day that I experienced during the project. It was day 26, I remember distinctly, and Subject 1 was complaining about the severe pain in her stomach. I examined her and the baby was kicking with extreme force, so much that I could see the bulges from the impact on the subject’s stomach. I begged Richards to take the subject to a hospital, but he wouldn’t hear it. He told me to give her some painkillers and get back into his office. By this time the students were already asleep in their rooms and since the cells on the third floor were soundproof, not even the subjects from adjacent cells heard the woman screaming, let alone anyone else. Richards and I observed Subject 1 on camera, as she writhed in pain. She banged on the floor, begging to be let out, after which she lay on the bed, holding her stomach and screaming in pure agony. I saw her stomach stretching out, as if something poked it from the inside and then her skin ripped open and a tiny hand emerged. Blood sprayed out like a fountain and I saw a deformed, blood-covered head pop out, further opening the abdomen. The subject screamed, now more in terror than pain, as she helplessly watched her baby burst through her stomach. Only seconds later, her head dropped onto the bed and she stopped moving. The baby started crying, but it was a kind of cry I had never heard before. It sounded guttural and gurgling. “Victor, what are you waiting for?!” Richards yelled “Go take care of the baby!” I stared at the thing on the camera, unable to move. Whatever that thing was, it wasn’t human. It had an abnormally large head, extremities of unequal proportions and a voice that sounded anything but human. It cried vigorously for a while, gradually losing its potency and going completely silent. “Victor!” Richards yelled again, but I was frozen in place. Richards violently stood up and stormed out of his office. I saw on the cameras that he was entering cell one. I came to my senses and figured that I had to insure myself somehow, or stop the project. I browsed Richards’ desktop and found the folder containing the details of the project. I glanced at the camera and realized that Richards was examining the dead baby and mother. I entered his email and sent all the details of the project to my email, nervously tapping on the desk as the files transferred. Richards was done wrapping the bodies in a sheet and started coming back, so as soon as the email was sent, I deleted the sent mail and returned to the camera feed, stepping away from the PC. Richards burst inside, beads of sweat forming on his temples. “Are they dead?” I asked. “Of course they’re dead, you idiot! I should report you to the project stakeholders for insubordination!” “Excuse me?” “If you had arrived in time, the baby of the subject could have survived!” “That’s not true! I’m not even trained to handle this sort of situation!” Richards sat in his chair and exhaled deeply, rubbing his eyes. “The bodies are wrapped up. Take them into the basement.” He said sternly. I dreaded the idea of carrying around a dead mother and her infant, but I didn’t want to defy the professor right now, to avoid arousing suspicion. I hauled the bodies downstairs and returned to Richards’ office, who still seemed pretty pissed. “Go home.” He said, staring at the screen of his computer. “Professor, if you need help I can-“ “Leave!” He didn’t need to tell me again. I wished him a good night and left, still shaking. As soon as I got home, I downloaded the contents of the email and deleted any remaining evidence. I could use this somehow, but I was too tired and traumatized to think of a plan. I went to bed, the events of the night replaying in my head. That night I kept having recurring nightmares of deformed, monstrous toddlers chasing me. When I woke up, I found the reality to be barely better than the haunting nightmares, but I had to go back to work. I knew Richards had me by the balls and I had no choice but to comply with his demands. When I arrived, the students were going about their normal everyday activities. Richards explained that he lied to the students and told them Subject 1 had to be taken to the hospital due to complications. I was appalled by his actions, but then remembered that I’m not that much different, so I stopped myself from judging him too much. Out of the five subjects, only two remained – Subject 3 and Subject 5. Subject 5 still showed no response to the treatment and Subject 3’s stomach kept growing rapidly. And then just two days after the death of Subject 1, she gave birth. Richards was ready this time, having invested in an incubator and he delivered the baby himself. The baby was just as deformed as the one from Subject 1. Richards separated the mother and the baby without even letting her take a look at her child, much to her protests. He ordered us to close the cell as he took the baby out. We had no choice but to comply, even the students, who reluctantly followed his orders. Subject 3 cried for hours, but Richards muted the camera and focused on observing the baby in the incubator. Ten days later, the baby had grown in size enormously, reaching above 8 feet in height and over 390 pounds. It had grown long extremities, its skin had become extremely hard, so needles could no longer penetrate it and its face no longer resembled that of a human, with various lumps and visible deformities on it. That wasn’t the only thing, though. A scan revealed that the creature itself had babies growing inside of it, at a seemingly fast pace, just like babies of the subjects. Due to this, Richards dubbed the creature the Mother. The incubator could no longer sustain a creature of such a size and I knew Richards could not possibly ask the college for more funds. I also knew he would not risk revealing the details of the project to the stakeholders, as they would shut it down immediately. He told me to take some time off and that he would let me know when my services were needed again. This was bad, because I knew he was up to no good, so to occupy myself during the sleepless nights, I reviewed the project documents that I had stolen. Sure enough, ten days later Richards told me to resume my duties. When I arrived, I saw an electronic door, which hadn’t been there before, in his office behind his computer. It led downstairs into a basement, which was expanded onto a huge area that resembled a laboratory. There were enormous test tubes filled with green liquid all over the place, with the biggest one being at the far end of the room. The Mother was there, now much bigger than I remembered it to be, seemingly sleeping and although its stomach was bulging, I could see more, smaller deformed creatures in nearby incubators. Richards filled me in on the details: “The Mother gave birth to three of them and continues to create more. The scan showed two more babies inside her stomach. In addition to that, it would seem that its babies also carry their own babies. They are extremely sick though, so I have dubbed them the Rejects.” “The college approved this?” I asked. “Of course not. They don’t know about this. I used my own funding to further the research.” I realized then that there were only nine students present in the building. “Where are the other participants?” I asked. Richards paused before answering: “They were found dead in their rooms. Suicide. The weaklings couldn’t live with the knowledge of what had to be done for greatness.” I also realized that Subject 3 was gone. I didn’t ask him where she was, nor how he disposed of the bodies. That left us with only Subject 5 remaining. She was extremely malnourished and sick, as Richards saw no use in feeding or taking care of her. Over the course of next few days, fewer and fewer students kept showing up. More committed suicide, whereas a lot of them were killed handling the babies. It soon became apparent that the creatures were toughening up quickly, their skin becoming hard, their speed and strength increasing way above humans’, etc. Richards had one of the grown versions placed inside the cell of the previous subjects and sent one student to feed the creature. The creature was highly aggressive, so by the time it was done with the student, what was left of him was strewn all over the cell. Everyone was fully aware of Richards’ intentions by then, but no one dared oppose him. A lifetime in prison put anyone off from trying anything stupid, like reporting him to the authorities. Every day he would emphasize multiple times how we would be rich by the time we were done, or how everyone would end up in prison for life, if anyone decided to betray him. He knew exactly what to say to instill fear in his subordinates, including me. Out of all project participants, only Richards, myself and three more students remained by day 60 and I knew it was only a matter of time until it was my turn. Things were getting out of hand and I knew I had to put a stop to this. Richards never let anyone down in the lab without his permission and he was the sole holder of the keycard which opened the electronic lock, but that was of no interest to me. I had to get Subject 5 and the students out of there. Based on the conversations I’ve had with the guards, they were loyal to their company and not to Richards, so I knew I could trust them with some of the details. I scheduled my email containing all the project data to automatically be sent to the security company and the college twelve hours after I start my shift. I then pulled the guard from my building aside. I told him everything about the project and how most of the people were dead now, to which he seemed surprised and terrified. He agreed to wait until Richards went to sleep in his room and that we would then unlock the cell and let everyone out. Before we managed to finalize our plan though, Richards called me into his office, interrupting us. I followed him there and stood in front of his desk, as he stared at the computer screen for a while. When he decided it was time to pay attention to me, he looked at me and said: “Victor. How are you feeling?” “I’m fine, professor.” I lied. “No, you’re not. I can see it on you. This whole thing bothers you. I know it.” “It doesn’t. I’m okay with this.” “Victor. You’re a horrible liar. But I have something that might change your mind. Come with me.” He opened the electronic door and led me downstairs. By now, most of the incubators had deformed creatures of various sizes inside of them, some of them much taller than humans, others the size of toddlers. Richards led me around and stopped in front of one of the incubators. “Look.” He pointed and my eyes widened. Inside the test tube was a very small, perfectly healthy, perfectly normal human baby. “Given birth to by one of these monstrosities.” He said “You see? We achieved greatness.” “How is this possible?” “I believe there’s a variety of factors. According to all the data I’ve gathered, there is a very, very small chance of a normal human baby being born, but there *is* a chance.” “But that means the project is a failure. We would need to breed dozens, if not hundreds of these creatures, in hopes of getting one healthy baby.” “No! It is *not* a failure!” He rebuked “We’re going to go down in history, why can’t you see this?” “I’m sorry professor, but the only thing you’ll be remembered as will be a cold, heartless murderer who pretended to be a scientist. I know what the project is truly about. I’ve read your files and I know you never intended to use the project for any so-called greatness. All you wanted was to make money and this gives you a chance to sell these creatures as a weapon on the black market. And I also know that dropping out of the project never posed any threat to the participants. You lied to us.” “That’s not-“ “I’ve already contacted the security agency and the college. They will know everything soon enough.” “How dare you!” He scoffed, before calming down “Well, no matter.” He pulled out a pistol from behind his back and pointed it at me. “The subject is a success and the Mother will be transferred to a new base for further research. I planned on killing off the students and the remaining subject tonight and offering you a chance to come with me, but since you know too much, you’ll have to join them.” “You can kill me, but you won’t get away with what you’ve done. You can’t stop this, professor.” Just then, there was a sound of glass cracking behind Richards. He turned around in time to see one of the test tubes breaking, the green liquid pouring out. The creature inside stumbled out, voraciously gurgling and striding towards the professor. “Stay back!” Richards fired a few shots into the creature, but it only flinched. And then the Mother opened her eyes. Her eyes were completely black and yet despite that, I knew that her gaze was fixed directly on me. She groaned, emitting a deep vibration and her children raised her heads in response. More tubes broke and before I knew it, the professor and I were running back upstairs, Richards locking the doors with his keycard. There was a loud banging and I turned around just enough to see a dent appear on the door. When we reached his office, Richards fumbled for his computer, frantically clicking. “No, I can’t let my data get destroyed!” He said to no one in particular. The loud bang now resounded directly on the door behind Richards, but he seemed oblivious to it. I didn’t stay to see what would happen to him. I ran the hell out as the bangs got louder, just in time to hear the door break and a cacophony of gunshots and monstrous screams ensue. Richards screamed in agony, before his own voice got drowned out. The guard was there and had a visibly confused look on his face. “No time, we gotta save the others!” I shouted. “No, there’s no time!” He grabbed me by the arm. The screams of those creatures resounded behind us and I could see them emerging from Richards’ office, covered in blood, with blood-thirsty looks on their faces. I stood there for a moment contemplating my next action, but my cowardice took hold once more and I knew that I wouldn’t be able to make it if I went for the others. So instead, I listened to the guard and we both bolted out of there. “Go, go! Intervention will be here soon!” The guard shouted as we ran, but only moments later, I heard him get grabbed, as the monsters piled on top of him and ripped him into pieces. I ran outside and stopped only when I reached the gate. The guard who was there stopped me and upon recognizing me, said that he was informed of the situation of the project. When I told him that there’s been an outbreak, his eyes widened and told me to stay here, while he investigates. I begged him not to go, mostly because I didn’t want to be left alone, but my pleas fell on deaf ears and he scurried off. I went inside the guardhouse and picked up the phone, only just then realizing that I had blood on my clothes. I had no idea how I had gotten it on me, but upon inspection, I realized it wasn’t mine. I tried dialing 911, but there was no signal. Upon reading the guideline on the side, I realized that the phone only took calls, but couldn’t make them. I dropped the handset when I looked at the camera feed and saw one of the guards getting jumped by those creatures and getting ripped into pieces. They were everywhere and most of the guards were dead. I couldn’t stay there, or I’d die. I went out of the guardhouse and ran towards the wooded area, looking behind every now and again to make sure nothing was following me. After what felt like forever and my legs started to give way, I stopped to take a break. The campus was far behind me and no one followed me. From there, I made my way safely home. Out of all the participants of the Fertility Project, I was the only confirmed survivor later on. I have no idea what exactly happened, but I heard that the biology building had a pipe explosion, which caused the entire place to come down. Whether it was that, or something else, I’m glad, because it hopefully killed The Mother and her nasty children. I wake up every night, seeing her black, penetrating gaze through the test-tube and I feel as if she knows where I am at all times, despite not seeing me. The guilt of letting those poor students and subjects die wracks me every day, as well. I don’t feel sorry for the human baby that most likely got killed, though. Nothing good could have come out of those monsters. The only consolation I have is the fact that Richards died before he could fully weaponize and sell his project. The authorities are after me now and I don’t know if they intend to sentence me to a life in prison, but I’ll make it easy for them. There’s a gun next to me and when I’m done writing this, I’m going to use it. Hopefully, I’ll be able to sleep peacefully again, for the first time in [many months.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/egxplg/im_a_member_of_a_security_taskforce_ive_been_sent/)",
715,"I played an innocent game, I regret what it did to my child I’ll never forget it. The day I subscribed to unimaginable sorrow. I didn’t know what I was doing. I know I can’t be blamed for it. I was young and naïve. “Here Danny this is how you play! You prick your finger like this, and then you write your name with the blood, fold it up, make your wish, and burn it in the candle.” Came 10-year-old Marks voice. I watched as he held the paper out over the candle that sat centered in the middle of our sloppily drawn pentagram. “Here you try.” He handed me a small piece of ripped paper. I never considered what the consequences could be. “What did you wish for Mark?” I asked trying to figure something out. “If I tell you it won’t come true.” I should’ve known that. That’s how birthday wishes work to. After some careful consideration I decided to wish that Zack would get hurt super badly. Zack was my school bully and I hated him. I pricked my finger with the needle and wrote my name with the small amount of blood. I held it over the candle and only released it when the flame began to burn my finger. A few weeks later Zack was in a horrible car accident. Both his parents and sister were killed, and he was left in a wheelchair. I had wanted Zack to get hurt, but not like this. His family didn’t deserve any of that. I was traumatized by the incident, but I never told anyone that it was my wish. I Asked Mark if his wish came true and he got mad at me and stopped talking to me. In my head that confirmed it. I decided I would never mess with this stuff again. Years later, during college I met Jackie. She was curt, matter of fact, blunt. She dressed in loose jeans and dirty flannels, giving the image that she didn’t care about her appearance. I really didn’t care for her as a person, bit was forced to work with her on a project regarding the intricacies of modern art. I was only taking an art class an elective because I enjoyed drawing, but my major was Computer Science. She was okay to work with and did her part well enough. I managed to graduate with an associates degree and got a decent job working for a large semi-conductor company. “Happy one-year anniversary Danny. Make sure to check the company website and make your 10 hours of vacation are added.” My boss’s voice conveyed no congratulatory tone. He handed me a cupcake with a “one” shaped candle and walked away from desk. I finished work for the day and decided to stop for some coffee on my way home. I wanted to get the deck re-painted before the sun went down and needed an extra kick after a long day. I was waiting for my Coffee when I heard my name. “Danny? Is that you Danny?” Came a female voice. I turned and found myself looking at a rather pretty girl about my age. She seemed familiar but I couldn’t a figure it out. “Yes, do I know you?” I asked with no small amount of suspicion. She laughed in a manner I found rather cute. “Yes, you do.” She stated flatly, waiting for me to recognize her. After a moment she sighed. “Its Jackie. I’m Jackie from college. Remember the super boring art project?” She inquired. I was stunned, and apparently my face showed it. “Pick your jaw up, you look like an idiot,” she teased with a laugh. We both got our coffee and sat at a table to catch up. When we decided to leave, I worked up some courage and asked her for her number. “Oh, I get it, now you’re into me, but in college I wasn’t good enough for you?” She teased with a gleam in her eye. I shrugged apologetically and decided to play her game right back. “To be fair, in college you dressed like a bum. Acted like it to if I remember correctly,” I fired back with a smirk. I was sifting through my memories, trying to remember if she had ever showed any interest in me. She sat up in her chair for a moment with a look of surprise, and then settled back down, resting her chin on her fist. “Touché,” she conceited. A small smile appeared on her lips. “Hand me your phone. I think that I would like to see you again after all.” I couldn’t help but feel a little flattered. Again, I wore my emotions on my sleeve, and she saw right through me. “Your blushing,” She stated. I could feel my cheeks get a bit hotter. She giggled that cute giggle again, and with that we said our goodbyes and headed our separate ways. We continued dating for some time. Things were going incredibly well. We spent many evenings out together, frequenting bars and clubs, or sitting at home, watching movies and shows with just each other as company. We decided she would move into my apartment, as it was larger and closer to her work. To commemorate the occasion, we got a kitten. Despite Jackie’s tomboyish nature, she insisted that we name it Mittens. I avoided using the name at every possible chance, preferring just to call it cat. I could feel second hand embarrassment every time she would say its name in her baby voice. It was a few months later that the big news came. Jackie was pregnant. I was overjoyed. I was scared. I was happy. I was sad. Emotions flowed through me like a river, but they eventually stabilized, and I felt nothing but excitement. While the pregnancy was not planned, we were financially okay, and I was planning to propose anyway. I had a dream that night. *A lone candle burns in a dark room. The flame grows larger and begins to stutter. From the flames a piece of torn paper emerges. The paper floats wistfully into the air, unfolding. Written on blood on the paper is the word “Danny.” A white flash. A car is driving through a four way stop light. They have the green. They start driving and are immediately struck in the side by a large SUV that ran a red. Two dead adults in the front. A dead young girl in the back. Zack, unconscious and bleeding in the back, legs crushed. An unfamiliar young boy stands next to the ruined car, staring at me, his hands coated in blood.* I woke to up a loud booming in the hallway. I looked to the door as the pounding approached. “Rooaar, I am wifezilla!” Jackie’s voice rang out as she entered the room dressed in sweats with her hair frizzy and unkempt. I smiled as I looked at her, my dark dream fading into the back of my mind as the woman I loved filled me with light. I decided this was the moment. “Well, actually you aren’t Wifezilla,” I said to her as I casually reached under the bed and grabbed the ring from out of her line of sight. I could almost feel her gaze piercing the back of my head. “However,” I continued as I dropped to one knee in-front of her, “I would like you to be. Jackie, you have made me the happiest man alive, and know that sounds cliché but I don’t know how else to word it. I can’t wait any longer. Will you marry me?” I opened the black velvet box, revealing a sparkling diamond ring. She fell to her knees with me and gave me a resounding, tear filled “Yes.” The baby was born nine months later, healthy as could be. Soon after we were happily married. We bought a new house together, a nice place to start our family together. The cat had a hard time adapting and kept peeing in random places, but after a few months started to use the litter box again. During that time, we shared many secrets and shames, and she became the first one I ever told of how I had wished for Zack to be hurt. She had hugged me and said there was no way it could be my fault, and our life together moved on. “Vroom here comes the airplane,”I said playfully as I tried to get Ethan to eat his food. He smiled happily until the food entered his mouth. His face scrunched and he began crying loudly. I figured I wouldn’t like mashed carrot either. After picking him up and calming him down I decided to try one more time. I placed the baby food on the table beside me and tried to feed him. He screamed again, and I heard glass shatter. I looked down and saw the baby food on the ground, shattered glass and orange mush flung all over the floor. I must’ve bumped the table? It was the only explanation. He was just old enough now that he started to sleep in the crib. He showed incredible dexterity and was able to climb out the crib if we didn’t raise the gate correctly. He did not like the crib. He cried every night unless he fell asleep with us. We let him lay with us until he was asleep, and then would carefully transfer him to his crib. In the middle of the night I woke to my door creaking open. I strained my eyes in the dark, trying to see what opened it, but it was useless. Quick as a dart I turned on my bedside lamp only to find Ethan in the doorway. My heartbeat began to normalize when I realized there was no danger. Upon returning him to his crib I noticed that somehow, the gate had been lowered. By the time Ethan was two years old he was finally sleeping in his own bed. On this particular night we had decided to stay up late to watch a movie together. Ethan snuggled with Jackie, and we watched Pixars newest movie as a family. Ethan pointed to the floor at his sippy cup and looked back up at Jackie. She set him down to go get it when he accidentally stepped on the cat’s tail. Mittens back arched, and with a loud hiss she scratched Ethans arm before darting off into another room. Ethan cried loudly, a small amount of blood seeping through the shallow wound. After some comforting and a bandage, we were able to calm him and send him to sleep. In the middle of the night we were woken by a loud, violent yowl. There was a crash, another loud yowl, and then nothing. Jackie and I both jumped out of bed and ran to see what was happening. In the kitchen we found Ethan sitting, drinking happily from his sippy cup. Not four feet from him was Mittens. I heard Jackie stifle a gasp. Mittens neck was turned at an impossible angle, clearly broken. A small amount of blood dripped from her mouth. We looked for intruders but found no sign of forced entry. We never had an explanation. I suspected Ethan, but Jackie wouldn’t hear of it. Ethan was seven now. He was in the middle of second grade. He had been doing well in school and was learning to write. We received a call from his teacher, Mrs. Connie. We were told he written a rather inappropriate story and were asked for a parent teacher conference. When we arrived, we were told that Ethan’s behavior had begun to degrade. He was starting to lose friends because he was being mean to them. We told the teacher that at home Ethan acted as normal as ever. She handed us his sloppily written story: *I have a cat. Her name is Mittens. Mittens is nice to me. Mittens is soft. One day Mittens was mean to me, so I gave myself to the other me, and he made Mittens go away.* The story sent shivers down my spine and all but confirmed what I had already suspected. Jackie only scoffed at the idea of her angel doing something so brutal. Besides it wouldn’t even be physically possible, given his age at the time, right? We thanked Mrs. Connie for her time and headed home. Once home, we sat Ethan down to have a talk about his story. “Ethan,” I started, “Did you write this story?” I handed the paper to him. He looked it over and nodded up at me, with his big child eyes gleaming with life and energy. “Did Mrs. Connie show you my story?” He asked. I nodded to him. “I told her not to. She wasn’t supposed to. Now I want Mrs. Connie to go away.” He crossed his arms and pouted. “That’s no way to talk about a teacher. Mrs. Connie is only there to help you. Ethan, who is the other you?” I wanted answers fast. My child was possibly suffering from mental illness and I wanted to put an end to it as soon as possible. Ethan’s demeanor seemed to change with the subject, his eye glazing over, losing that childish look and adopting the gaze of someone who had lived a millennia. “There is no other me. Its only a story.” The voice sounded like his, but the rhythm was different, almost old. “Ethan, I need you to be honest with me.” I refused to relent. “There is no other me!” Ethan shouted with surprising authority. Ethan eyes suddenly conveyed murderous intent. Ice cold dread shot through my body. He got down from the couch and walked to his room, slamming the door behind him. I looked at Jackie, “What the hell was that?” She shrugged, visibly shaken by the ordeal. Ethan didn’t come down for the rest of the night. Jackie received a call from the school the next morning. Mrs. Connie had been found dead in her classroom. She hung herself from the ceiling, found by one of the kids that would come in early for extra help. Jackie told me she tried to have a sit down with Ethan about suicide, but he would only sit silent. Right in the middle of their conversation he just got up and walked into his room, shutting the door behind himself. It went on like this for weeks. Ethan wanted nothing to do with us. He would still go to school, eat and do everything required of him, but without a word. Tonight, I was up to get a late-night snack in the middle of the night. I walked past Ethan’s room and heard something. I put my ear to the door. Whispering? “Make them go away. Make them both go away. No, its wrong. They are nice to us. No! They make us do things we don’t want to do. They get us in trouble. Let me make them go away. Just like Mrs. Connie. Just like Mittens.” I lost my balance and stumbled, making a small thump on the floor. The whispering stopped. Ethan’s door slowly cracked open. I was terrified. From the barely cracked door I could see one of Ethan’s eyes staring intently at me, wrapped in empty darkness. “Hey bud, I’m just on my way to get a snack, would you like something?” My voice was a little shaky. Ethan stared with his single visible eye for a moment more before ever so slowly shutting his door. I shivered as goosebumps coated my body, my appetite suddenly gone. I returned to my room and appraised Jackie of what I heard. She sat up in bed and listened as I told her my suspicions of mental illness. Jackie only nodded, finally relenting to me that she did not want to believe that our child might be a sociopath. As I talked to her about options I watched as her face suddenly drained of blood, her eyes focusing behind me. I turned to find Ethan standing in the doorway. When had he opened the door? He stepped into the room, impossibly making no noise at all. The door shut behind him, affected by an unseen force. “There will be no mental help.” He stated flatly. “I am not a sociopath.” He looked at Jackie. “Ethan did not kill Mittens, I did.” He looked to me. “And I also killed Mrs. Connie.” It was startling to hear such words, and such confidence conveyed in the voice of a little boy. He stared with dead eyes from Jackie, and back to me. The door opened behind him, and he walked silently back to his room, again shutting the door behind him. Jackie and I were frozen in mute shock, both horrified by what our child was doing. We stayed up the rest of the night, discussing new options. We opted for church. We wouldn’t tell him, we would simply show up. But the next day Ethan was back to normal. He was talkative and seemed to have no recollection of what had happened. He attended church with us happily, and even joined in the singing sessions. During this time of peace, I decided to start some research into the occult. Possession, curses, and even voodoo. The local library had a surprising amount of literature pertaining to all things supernatural. For the first week or so I read a lot of interesting things and more often than not found myself reading simply because it was fascinating. I was will flipping through a particularly old leather volume, aptly named *Ritualia*, when I saw an illustration that made my breath catch in my throat. It was a simple drawing. A single candle, in the middle of a pentagram, a piece of paper burning in the flame. Memories of my childhood flooded through my vision. The guilt of Zacks dead parents, and his paralysis. I gulped, and read the passage beneath the illustration: *The Ritual of Desire: Simply draw a pentagram, place a lit candle in the middle, and burn parchment with your name written in blood. Then you may state your desire. Be forewarned, the simplicity of this ritual betrays its price. Should your desire be answered, the being behind the veil will extract the price of the firstborn. For the firstborn to be returned into the custody of our world, the one who states their desire must forfeit their life, or the life of a loved one. An exorcism may also work, but no such research exists to back up this claim.* This was it. I found exactly what I was looking for. I could find no author or credit otherwise anywhere within the book. When that thing returned to Ethan’s body, I would be ready. I returned to the church that evening before heading home. I found Father David sitting at a desk in a back room, sifting through various papers. I did not know him well, having only been going to his church about two weeks, and only having two face to face interactions with him. He welcomed me warmly and asked what I could do for him. I stumbled for the correct words. “Father, if you believe in god and heaven, then you must also believe in the devil, and hell, right?” I questioned. “Of course. Lucifer tempts us everyday and it is our duty to believe in the lord to protect us.” He explained. “And demons to then? And the rituals used to contact them? To ask favors of them?” Father David’s smile vanished, and he stood up from his chair, eyeing me now with a look of suspicion and fear. Before he could speak, I began talking. I explained everything to him, from the incident with the candle, Zacks accident, and all the strange and terrifying incidents with Ethan. I told him of the book I found in the library, and its suggestions. During my explanation of the situation, Fathers gaze transformed from fear and disgust, to stone cold determination. Finally, I stopped talking, waiting for a response. “Tonight,” Father David started, “We do the exorcism tonight. Everyday is another day he could hurt you or anyone else.” I was caught off guard, but I was not about to argue with him. I watched as he grabbed a few items. A large, ancient looking bible, a large silver crucifix, and an ornately decorated glass bottle filled with water. In the back of my mind, I hoped Jackie wouldn’t be mad at me. I walked in the front door first. I was going to tell Jackie what was going on before I invited Father David in. I didn’t have the chance. The house was dark, save the light of the silent TV, casting long shadows throughout the room. Jackie was on the couch, her knees up to her chest, her hands hidden under her crossed arms. Her expression conveyed pure terror. She looked at me with both relief and fear. Her eyes darted around, looking for something. Where was Ethan? “Church *dad,* really*?*” Came the voice of child. Ethan entered the living room from the kitchen. He walked into the living room, his strut signifying that this territory belonged to him. Jackie let out a pained sob. In the darkness before I had not noticed the tears running down her face. Ethan walked in front of the TV, the glow giving his facial features a sickening white look, fringed with deep shadows. He held something up before his eyes, carefully examining it. It caught the light on a strange, reflective way and I felt my stomach turn as I recognized Jackie’s wedding ring, still on the finger. My voice lowered to a growl. “What have you done?” I whispered a tone more threatening than I thought myself capable of. Ethan only smiled at me and dropped the finger on the ground. I took a step back and flung the front door open. “Father its happening now!” I yelled into the darkness outside. Ethan’s smile disappeared, betraying his surprise. Father David busted through the door, his crucifix now on a silver chain around his neck, bible open in one hand, holy water in the other. Before anyone could respond Father splashed the water onto Ethan, who fell to the ground and scooted away from the priest as fast as possible until he hit the wall. Again, the priest splashed him with the water, reciting words from the bible in Latin. After a minute of small splashes of water followed by Latin passages from the bible Father David looked to me, “Quickly we must restrain him, this wont work for long.” Through strange snarling noises Ethan began to laugh, but it was quickly put to a stop when Father David splashed a large amount of holy water on him. I grabbed a nearby lasso from Ethan’s toy box. It may have been a child’s toy, but rope was rope and this would due. I quickly restrained him while he was stunned from the constant stream of water. “Please Ethan, come back to us.” I whispered in his ear as I tied his arms behind his back. I stood up when the job was finished. The priest used the last of his water, and then dropped the empty bottle, replacing it with the silver crucifix. Long, powerful phrases boomed from Father David’s voice. He held the crucifix inches from Ethan’s face, shouting holy phrases at him. The commanding tone of his voice could not be mistaken. I rushed to Jackie’s side. She was holding her left hand to her chest, crusted blood covered the front of her shirt. I took her hand and gently inspected the wound. She had no ring finger, only a fleshy wound of torn skin and meat. I met her eyes with mine and smiled. I would be her strength. I used the sleeve of my shirt to wrap the wound and contain the bleeding, kissing her forehead when I was finished. I looked at her a moment, enjoying the silence with just me and her. I perked up. Why was it silent. I turned quickly around to see Ethan standing over Father David, who was now on the ground, clutching his crucifix to his heart his face still wrought with determination. Blood seeped freely from his mouth. In his hand Ethan held a long, glistening mass of red and pink. I realized with horror that is was Father David’s tongue. Ethan, now panting, and covered in more sweat than holy water, bent down and picked up the ornate bottle. He smashed it against the wall shattering it, leaving a razor-sharp protrusion in his hand. “Ethan no!” I shouted as a leapt up. It was to late. Ethan slammed the razor glass in Father David’s throat, burying it nearly six inches deep. I fell to my knees. I felt Jackie embrace me from behind. It was an embrace motivated of pure love, and hapless sorrow. She whispered to me, as we both watched Ethan slam the glass over and over again into Father David’s throat, now a mess a blood and flesh, “I read *Ritualia* years ago, when Ethan first started exhibiting strange behavior,” She explained. I felt her lips kiss the side of my head as she rested on my back. “I know you saw it to, and that’s why you brought the priest. I know what has to be done.” Those words shattered any sense of hope I had left. The color left the world, and even Ethan’s terrible acts seemed numb before my eyes. I couldn’t stop her. I couldn’t will my body to move. I watched as she leaned down and picked up a piece of the shattered glass, placing it in my hand and wrapping my fingers around it. She moved in front of me and placed a palm on my cheek, looking lovingly into my eyes. She picked up my hand with the glass and brought it to her neck. “You have to be the one to do it.” She said softly. “Please,” she pleaded “No,” I whispered back, “I…I can’t.” She smiled softly. “You have to, or we all die. There’s no more time.” Ethan stopped stabbing Father David, and looked at us, noticing what was happening. “No!” Came two voices from Ethan’s mouth. He started towards us, and I looked back at Jackie. She was still smiling at me. I couldn’t stop the tears. They just flowed, unrestrained. I didn’t understand how there could be so many tears. I laid Jackie’s body down, clutching her head into my chest as I listened to her final breaths leave her body. I stayed like that for hours, sobbing loudly, my entire world, crumbling around me as I held her. Eventually I couldn’t cry anymore. It was as if all my emotion had left my body. Everything was numb. I looked around my living room. It was a as if a tornado had come through. The sun had come up at some point, but everything was grey. There was no color left in the world. I gently laid Jackie down and moved to examine Ethan where he had fallen. No heartbeat. The possession had proven to much for his frail body. I walked upstairs and grabbed my gun, loading a single round into the chamber. These are my final words, as I sit in my living room, surrounded by the body of my soulmate and our child, and the innocent man who tried to help. Don’t play with rituals. Don’t play Bloody Mary. Don’t play with Ouija boards. You never know what might be real.",
716,"Depressed, paranoid schizo, my story. Really want to kill myself and SOONThis is a long, rambling story, and I'm sorry. I really am. I'm not a stranger to depression or suicidal ideation at all, probably like many of you, I've had half a leg in those worlds as far back as I can remember having complex feelings (early teens, I'm 30 now). I've developed a lifestyle of coping mechanisms for this including pretty heavy isolationism, which ended up really hurting me socially. When I was twenty I dropped out of college because of the social pressure, and joined the military as part of a secret, passive goal of getting blown up. I signed up for EOD Army but after I took the tests the Air Force recruiter in the same office called me and offered any job I wanted, which honestly probably saved my life (I don't know how I'd have actually handled explosives, but I think if something didn't blow up on me I'd have just done it myself somehow, I was going into it with a very dark and specific intent) and I spent the next 4-5 years as a linguist. For the first couple of years I did alright, carved out a niche and found my wife, but then things went downhill, and I don't really now why, around when I was 23. My social anxiety started to grow at an alarming rate, to the point where I felt genuinely scared around even small teams of coworkers, which is not good for a military environment. I withdrew from everyone, moved off-base with my wife, and cut off all non-necessary interactions. During this time I had also cut off everyone from back home, and for the vast majority of those people never regained contact. I also lost contact with my military friendships, as we gradually moved to different posts and I sort of ""vanished"". I started to go through a period of what I remember at the time labelling as disassociation, before finally starting to hallucinate, first auditory, then visual hallucinations. I remember when I first saw a professional on base, before I was ready to admit to the hallucinations, I described the feeling of everyone and everything around me being made out of cardboard, as if it was all a ruse set up to get some sort of a reaction out of me, or a hidden show or something. I recall confessing how every time I would drive anywhere I would be terrified that every car on the road was secretly following me, and how I would sometimes take unusual routes or sudden turns to try and shake the supposed followers. When I finally told them about the hallucinations, the therapist I spoke to asked me to report to the general medical facility the next morning to speak with my doctor with her. When I got there, there was no discussion really, other than them telling me I would be committed to the local mental facility for an indefinite evaluation period, or I would face discipline from my commander including a potential court-martial for disobeying the order to seek treatment (that was the ultimate threat at least) for refusal (for anyone who cares it was first sergeant who enforced this, never spoke to commander from the point I admitted to hallucinating, which now looking back wonder if they did on purpose, I was junior enlisted straight out of a very long training pipe so I was easy to push around). So off we went. I was committed for a little over 2 weeks, during which time I was heavily medicated and the hallucinations quickly stopped, although all I wanted was to get out. I finally got out due to the hallucinations stopping and my command tried to salvage me by putting me back on duty. During this time I got to go home for Christmas and I tried to kill myself for the first time. It's weird, looking back, I don't let myself think of it as a suicide attempt, but it was. I took as much cough medicine as I could get down my throat without puking, and some other pills that I can no longer recall but I believe were advils, and had a very terrifying mental experience that went on for many hours (I lost my sense of time, started in the daytime and ended the next morning), and was shaking uncontrollably the next day. During this episode I lost control of my body, but before that happened I was self-harming and also split my knee open wide enough to see white stuff that was probably tendon? Anyway I was afraid of being found that way and being taken to the hospital so I did wrap it and it did close on it's own but the scar from that is very gnarly. After recovering I never touched cough medicine again. Shortly after returning I was recommitted by my command again for about 2 weeks, when I didn't show up to a formation (technically I did, but I never got out of the car once I got there). By the time I got out the second time, my chain of command had a very direct conversation with me and about 6 months later I was honorably discharged. My official diagnosis from the facility was paranoid schizophrenia (there were some other things I think, but that was the big one that seemed important to me). I suspect I am also undiagnosed bipolar, but don't put much stock in that sort of self-evaluation. I have this suspicion because, while I am very prone to sudden mood swings, I also have detected more gradual up/down phases in my life that tend to last from a week to as long as several months. Up means I feel more lonliness, more sexual urges, more urge to connect with others, which can be frustrating because I don't really know how to anymore, so when I'm ""up"" I'm normally doing creative things to the best that my chaotic habits will allow, music or poetry usually, but not coherent, often. When I am ""down"" I can stay in one room for weeks on end, typically programming, and it's like the world is dead to me. I moved home with my wife, who supported me through all of this, despite me being a pretty hard person to live with. I was withdrawn and didn't leave the house (my parents') for a long time. Despite being extremely against pot my entire life, I started smoking at this time when I found out that it made my head feel more normal, and would basically kill hallucinations for me, although very rarely it would make it worse. Once I realized that pot helped, I was absolutely hooked, and to this day smoke heavily and 24/7. Eventually, I felt well enough to work, and wanted to, so I got a part time job repairing things at a retail tech place. That turned into a datacenter job, which I worked overnight to avoid seeing too many people. Working with computers ended up being good for me (maybe) and I was able to get a job at a NOC downtown, where again they let me work overnight so I was mostly on my own and I could handle it. When working downtown I began to have more frequent paranoia and hallucinations, which I hid from my wife and work, using a combination of music/headphones, smoking before work, and disappearing from work strategically to hide, I was able to get by, and gradually things went back to normal, although not before I broke up with my wife and she moved back home. Once I got better though, I made up with her (she never knew about the ""relapse"" to this day) and she moved back out with my help and we were together again, if not perfect. I eventually got a high paying job in silicon valley programming things which I moved out to CA with my wife for. This is my current job and it may be important to note that I have completely hidden my diagnosis/condition (I don't trust psychologists very much so I'm not going to say I am or I'm not any specific thing personally) from all of my jobs, workers, family. NO ONE knows that I was diagnosed with schizophrenia except my old chain of command, and my wife. I lost contact with my family for about 6 months while I was in the military due to me being shitty/unwell and when I collected myself I chose to make up a lot of lies about that which to this day I feel a lot of guilt over. My wife told me at the beginning of last year that she was going to move out and divorce me. I definitely couldn't blame her, I was pretty much impossible to live with at that point due to mood swings and moving ever-more inward with my thoughts and experiences. I never left the house except to hide in my office, and when I was home, I probably didn't feel like I was there. Still, it happened so fast to me, even though it took months really. She told me one night she was going to go on a date, and not long after that she was in a new relationship with a polyamorous couple. Not very long after this she moved out to live with them. About 6 months later divorce papers came which I signed. Now I live alone with the two dogs that we adopted together. I love them more than I can bear to think, and to be honest if she had taken them or if I knew they didn't need me I would probably not be typing this. If I do kill myself that at least she will take the dogs or my folks will, that much I do know. They are both getting older and one of them has diminishing health and a lot of issues, and in my mind if I'm still here when she dies I'm going to drive her sister (I call them both sisters though the two dogs aren't related) to my wife's and then drive into the ocean. I'm terrified that I won't get better in time to handle her passing. I know it's just a dog but I've already admitted to being fucked up so that's me. I have tried dating a few times since it's been about a year now, since it really ended, but I haven't been able to. Usually what happens is I go through an ""up"" cycle where I feel capable of reaching out socially, that can last an indeterminate amount of time, when I will start talking to someone and really hit it off. But, invariably, I hit that downcycle in myself and suddenly even the act of sending a text message to an intimate relation just terrifies me. It's hard to explain, I sit there and I think about all the bad things that could happen from another living being knowing who I am or where I am or that I am thinking about them, and all I can bring myself to do is cut them off completely and hide in my room. During this time I don't feel the lonliness, but when my mood shifts into another upcycle it comes crashing down on me. I've kind of given up on meeting anyone. All I really want is my wife back. I don't really want someone new, so maybe that's why it's so hard. I've never felt close to my family, I'm adopted and we fought constantly in my youth, and I've always just wanted to have a family with me. I don't really feel like I belong anywhere. I have only had a handful or relationships in my life, and can count on one hand the individuals who I think have seen the real me, and she is at the top of that list. We were married 7 years. I can't express here how much losing her has affected me, I think about it all of the time. I see a therapist now who I constantly lie to to minimize my feelings, he doesn't even know about my past diagnosis. I have a hoard of risperidone (I think it's called) that I still take sometimes if I need it, I'm really just going to him so I'm not alone, but I for some reason keep lying to him and telling him that the divorce didn't really bother me. I guess I don't trust him if I had to put a reason to it. I sort of have this fear in my mind that anyone I show my true self to is going to just leave. My body is also riddled with scars, obvious self-harm, covering almost every inch of my legs and arms, and over a good bit of my chest. I still self-harm very regularly as a way to regulate my ups and downs. I don't know why but whatever extreme I am in cutting or bruising myself gives me control and makes me feel moderated, like I can breathe normally again. I prefer the feel of bruises because of the lingering pain to the touch but am worried about hematomas and internal blood pooling because I tend to overdo it trying to get the marks to show up right away, only to have giant marks way bigger than I intended the next day. Edges are much easier to control and I can get immediate relief, but the blood is a pain to deal with when you cut a lot, I ended up keeping old shirts and pants to wear on days I cut a lot because I ruined a lot of things by bleeding on them over the years. Anyway, right now I'm at home visiting my family, which I do once a year. The visit has been mostly okay except seeing my sister and her family (husband, 3 kids), which of course inside tears me apart. I was able to push through taking meds and strategically disappearing for about a week but today I just couldn't mask it. I felt okay for about the first hour of the day then suddenly and out of nowhere started to feel an extreme low come on. My family are loving, but are very traditional people and very distant from one another (I've literally never seen my mom and dad touch one another), and like to judge on any criteria available, I have never been able to discuss my inner feelings with them. When they discovered, against my efforts, that I was self-harming as a child, they did bring me to a therapist, but the therapy always was between me and the therapist, never with my family themselves. Being sad around my family has been more isolating than I thought it would be. Today we barely spoke, and I sort of just stayed in this small side-room. They think I'm working but I just keep my ear to the door listening to them. The sad thing is I'm not even listening suspiciously I keep waiting for what seems like a good time to try to go back out and ""reset"" and intermingle with them like everything is okay, but when I try I just make it worse. I try talking to them and my sentences are confused or I'll feel myself about to cry if I try to modulate my voice like I should, and I retreat. They think I'm upset about something, so they just ignore me. I They did that when I was a kid to, if ever I was bad, like when I stopped caring about school -- if I got bad grades they would sort of yell at me in the moment, but then just pretend I wasn't really there for days or weeks afterwards. It got to feel normal to me and maybe didn't help with some of my personal issues. I don't blame them at all I'm just letting it go because it came into my head, I am fucked up enough that I don't think anyone but me can really be blamed. All I really want to do is walk out there and start crying and to tell them that I can't do this, any of it, and that I need help now, but I can't imagine what they would do, or how to undo that. I want to go back to work and tell my boss that I can't do this, that every day I do these gymnastics around my job to make it work without me losing my mind and to beg for time off so I can go full-time inpatient somewhere, but my job is close to all I have now. My condition has only gotten worse I think and it's amazing to me that I've managed to learn and get the sort of career I have now, if I lost it I don't think I'd ever get back to this place again. I want my wife to text me and tell me that it'll be okay, that we can be together again. But she tells me about all of the amazing fun things she does where she is at now, how she hopes next year will be her year, her turning point, and I realize that she's turning away from me. I am glad that she will have a chance at being okay, she deserves to be away from me, but it feels so painful to think about. All I want is to know that I can hold her hands and not let go. The only thing I really want that I feel I can get to, is to get out. I really really really want to kill myself ASAP. I've gone from vague ideations, to my haphazard attempt a few years ago with pills, to now spending nights like this awake and researching the pros and cons of various suicide methods. I go into those fucking suicide prevention chats but I can't take it. It doesn't help. This probably won't help. This is so long no one is going to read it and why would they? I wouldn't come here and read a random asshole's long boo hoo either, and even thinking that someone would just makes me feel guilty. Life is hard, for everyone, for everything, if I can't make use of it why should I distract you all from being happy at least? My sister is bringing the kids up tomorrow, sooner than expected, to see us again, and I'm terrified. I can't see them, I can't be around them all, I can't smile, and god knows I'll never forgive myself if if I fall apart in front of the kids they are too young. The thought of faking it for another day just makes me feel empty in a scary way. I was out driving to get food earlier and I parked in a random lot about halfway, and was trying to figure out if walmart still sold guns before I decided to just get the food. But right now it feels like the only thing that I can really think of that stops me is how my family/ex and dogs would take it. But even that would be temporary, they would recover. I know people say suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem, but I've felt sad and have self-harmed since I was 11 or 12. It's never gone away. Sometimes it's been maneagable, able to be shoved to the background, but never for long enough, then it comes back, first at random then seemingly stronger each time, intensifying, and I can't tell it to go away. Everything feels bad and empty and pointless. I just sort of want out. I don't think I'm ever going to get better. Many days my head feels heavy, my teeth hurt more and more from clenching and the headaches go on forever, and I can't eat or sleep right, none of my old clothes fit. The last time I dropped weight this fast was right before I tried to kill myself with pills, around this same time of year. But that time I didn't even really want to kill myself, it just came upon me and I did it. Now I feel like it's more dangerous, and I definitely wouldn't use pills. I want it to maybe even look like an accident. Or maybe somewhere people won't find, but I want my family to have a body so they don't wonder. Why do people even post here? How am I supposed to end this? Fuck depressed people browse this and I'm overwhelmed with guilt because I think I'll just make them more depressed and I don't even want to post this. I really just want to get out of here somehow. I want this to end. I want my wife. I want my dogs. I want my family, and I want to know that they want to be around me. I don't want to keep feeling like just this broken pathetic thing that can't bring anything good to anyone. Everyone who knows me pays for it, one way or the other. I'm not reliable, and even when I want to be good I can't control my emotions. There's no amount of compensating I can do when I am in control that can convince people to deal with me when I'm not.",
717,"Hi. I'm a mom and wanted to say somethingI'm a browser, not a poster. I come here to read because of my own doubts, but that's not my point today. I have been reading a lot of desperate posts on here from young people expressing the wish to die or run away. I want you to know your life is worth living and you are worthy of enjoying your time on this planet. Hang in there and don't give up. My son ""came out"" to me as an atheist quite a few years ago and although I was upset, I accepted it because really what choice do I have? He is my baby. My own family rejected me for leaving our catholic faith to become a muslim, so I know that pain and would never do that to my baby. He grew up without grandparents because of me and I feel guilty enough about that. I hate the idea of my baby being in hell, because him being hurt is my worst fear. I would set myself on fire if I knew it would keep my son from being hurt, so I could never hurt him intentionally by disowning him, you get me? His happiness and safety are my #1 priority in life. I guess that's difficult to understand if you aren't a parent, but if you ever happen to become a parent, you might understand where I'm coming from. My life means nothing to me if my child is not happy and taken care of. He is near 40 years old and I would still drop everything to go help him if I knew he was struggling even a little bit. As a parent, I seriously I cannot fathom how parents can abuse, abandon and honor kill their own children. 40 years later, I still can't understand how my own family just left me behind like our lifelong relationship meant nothing to them. How can you look at this innocent little creature you created and not feel intense love for them? How can you watch them grow up and wish anything but happiness and safety on them? If you really want them to be muslim/christian/etc, doesn't it make sense to keep them alive, loved and safe so they have a chance and desire to reconvert? What purpose does disowning them do, except tear apart a family? Yes, I want my son to go to jannah. But he's able to make his own choices. I am here for him no matter what he does with his life, good or bad. I don't have to agree with his choices to be a mother to him. He is worthy of enjoying his life, the only worldly life he gets, and so is every other human being on this planet. Sorry for the long rant. I don't know why I wanted to say this here or if it will help anyone. But you are worthy of love. If your family refuses to love you, know that the world is filled with people who will love you for what you are. My family removed their love, but I found love in a kind man who gave me an equally kind son. The loneliness of being abandoned is unbearable, but I am glad I didn't commit suicide when I was going to, because then I wouldn't have my wonderful son or grandchildren. You deserve the same happiness no matter what you choose to believe in, and no matter what your family says.",
718,"How to know if parents are truly sorry for the abuse/neglect they caused you.As a child I percieved no choice but to conform to my parents desires out of fear. They were my main source of food and shelter and were willing to physically hurt and verbally berate me. As an adult, I got the ability to challenge my parents on their beliefs and behaviors because I now had financial freedom plus the benefit of now longer being subjugated to their physical strength. Initially, when I told my parents that hitting children is evil, they looked sorry and they spouted seemingly apologetic words. Over the course of a month or two, I was able to gather information from our conversations and figured out whether they were truly sorry or if they were only trying to manipulate me into compliance and belief without proof. *Distraction*, *Excuses*, and *Avoidance* 1. When I told my father that being hit by him as a child made me extremely sad, his reply was, ""My father hit me too; it's something I learned from my father. My childhood was a lot worse than yours"". Here, I was telling my dad something very honest and emotional and he dismissed my emotions and started talking about his own life. Also, he didn't take responsibility for hitting me and he didn't say he was sorry for hitting me. 2. I was telling my mom about the fact that I hated being a bully. I asked her about why she let my behave in such a crude and forceful manner. Her reply was, ""I would have never let you do that because I was bullied when I was a child."" Here, my mom blatantly lied because I was a bully and she knew I was a bully. Similar to my dad, she puts the focus of the conversation on herself by talking about her own experience with bullies instead of asking me about my experience and she did not apologize for not teaching me peaceful negotiation. 3. On one occasion, my entire family was in the room and I started talking about being hit, yet again. My mom immediately stood up and said, ""AGAIN? We've already talked about this. I want to talk about something else."" Here, my mom was revealing clear signs of unempathetic disinterest. She didn't care about what I had to say and she valued her own preference to avoid conversation more than my desire to speak about it. She knew this was important to me but she felt uncomfortable and so she tried to avoid the conversation by trying to silent me. Everyone in the room, except me, agreed with my moms intention of shutting me up. No one wanted to hear my thoughts. *** I knew that being honest was going to be difficult because no one else in my family or friend group was emotionally expressive during conversation. Up until that moment, I had spent my entire life lying about my feelings. After being dejected and having thoughts of suicide for so long, I came to the conclusion that if I didn't try to be honest, I might just end my life out of misery and frustration. As you can see, my family made excuses, distracted my feelings by talking about their own, avoided claiming responsibility and never apologized. The biggest piece of evidence for me was that they never initiated the conversation and they tried to silence me multiple times. We talked about similar issues on various occasions but only because I mentioned it. They never felt compelled to ask me more about my thoughts and experiences. Once this evidence presented itself, I made the conclusion that my family does not care about my thoughts and emotions. I already felt this to be true but the empirical evidence was know proving my hypothesis. Not only was I hit as a child by my parents but my entire family was perfectly commited to continuing the abuse into my adulthood by not listening to my thoughts and by attempting to make me belive that I did not experience maltreatment. Most children remember the abuse they suffered. If you try to diminish or manipulate your childs true emotions, they can leave you to find better and more loving relationships once they grow older. I left my family, not out of spite but because I can't care for people who don't care about me; and I will never go back.",
719,"8 year old boy may be raised by an alcoholic Borderline parent without a miracle... LINK: https://www.gofundme.com/f/hm2yc-help-save-my-son?utm\_source=customer&utm\_medium=copy\_link&utm\_campaign=p\_cf+share-flow-1 **BRIEF VERSION:** Living a nightmare, and my son is at risk of being emotionally devastated for years. His mother is an undiagnosed Borderline with alcohol and medication abuse problems and has launched a yearlong campaign of slander against me as an abuser. She has done this many times over our marriage and later recounted all her accusations, but this time she has started abusing our son emotionally. My 8 year-old son has been to a Children’s Psychiatric Unit two times for suicidal thoughts and self-harm (punching himself in the head and banging his head on walls). It is documented that he has been wanting to die since February 2019 and self-harming daily; I was not aware of this until April 2019 as my wife hid this from me for months. My son has been in his mother’s care since February of 2019, yet somehow I have been labeled the abuser by an Associate Judge of the 233rd in Tarrant County due to numerous filings of abuse by my wife. One of the most insane aspects is that my wife has admitted to alcoholic drinking and emotional abuse, but that was also blamed on me as a “controlling and abusive husband”. This story is insane, but I have included it below. I will upload supporting documents if possible. **LONG VERSION:** I have been married for 10 years and am now going through the 2nd divorce my wife has pursued in that time. I am a Christ follower and was married with the belief that my wife was also a Christian…but there were some issues that make her belief questionable. We had both recently come to Christ and were both Recovering Alcoholics/Addicts; I had been in recovery for many years, she had about 3 years recovery. Prior to our marriage we met with pastors and spent much time in Scripture and discussing what a Biblical marriage entailed, but that all changed very quickly after we were married. We were married in 2019 and I was met with many surprises in the months that followed. My wife had started drinking again prior to our marriage, never informed me, and told me that she decided she was not actually an alcoholic. She also had started medication seeking from our family doctor after being off of all medication for years before our marriage; she has issues with abusing Clonazepam and other psych meds. The first 2 years were very rocky as she insisted on running around with old ‘friends’ who were not Christians, drinking to excess every weekend, and abusing her ‘prescriptions’. She refused to spend any time with me, her husband, and started going out multiple times a week with her old friends (none of them Christian) and co-workers drinking and partying. She refused to place me above her friends or family and would refuse to discuss her reticence at spending time together. Over time we met with our pastors and her behavior would improve for periods of time, but it never stayed consistent for more than a few months. She eventually stopped drinking again for a time, but never returned to Alcoholics Anonymous, and we ended up having a child in 2011. All during the pregnancy she stopped the prescriptions and never drank at all. She was happy and I thought we had turned a corner. Within months of my son’s birth my wife’s demeanor changed dramatically. She was overwhelmed and started making paranoid statements about me having affairs with co-workers. She started drinking again and was back on the prescriptions. She utterly refused to talk with anyone as a couple, but would seek out ‘Christian counselors’ who she could make claims of controlling and abusive behavior to; asking her not to get drunk and not to overspend money was controlling, asking her to stay home with her husband was abusive, etc., but she never told them the facts, just that she was abused and terrified of me. All these claims were eventually recanted many times over the years, and she admitted she does not know why she makes these claims. My amazing son was born in 2011 (I used an old picture of him, so he is not easily identifiable). He was raised in the Bible since he was a toddler, and he loves “God and Jesus” more than anything, even his parents. A year after his birth, I came home from taking AA meetings into Union Gospel Mission of Tarrant County and found a letter from my wife. My wife left a rambling letter about how I was an abusive husband/father and did not help with raising our son. I had gotten promoted at work and now could not work from home 4 days a week and had to be in the office 5 days a week; a change that made her resentful as I was not able to care for our son during the day. She had packed their clothes and disappeared with him for 2 months. She refused to answer her phone/emails and would not let me see my child. I was able to find them staying with her relatives and eventually my wife returned. She stated she did not know why she had left, but “felt like something horrible was going to happen”. She admitted that there had never been any abuse, but that she was angry that I had to work outside of my home office and was not able to watch my son during the day and she “snapped” under the pressure. Once she returned, we met with pastors again, and she swore she would never do anything like that again. Yet, within 18 months in 2013/2014, she again left for 6 months and filed for divorce. This followed some very difficult financial times that created a lot of stress for our marriage (each time there is a stressor that causes my wife to break mentally). This was the same as before, a rambling letter accusing me of various things and her refusal to answer messages or let me see my son for months. Eventually, she returned home after 6 months. Again, my wife stated she did not know why she did this and that she could not “control \[my\] thoughts, I thought something bad was going to happen”. This time she upped the ante by telling numerous friends and family that I had (a) raped her for years, (b) abused my toddler son, and (c) she was afraid for her life. For whatever reason, God did something amazing and my wife agreed to seek counseling at our Church. Again, she admitted that I had never abused her or my son and that she did not know why she did this or made the false accusations. Again, she swore we would never go through such a devastating event again. This event really hurt my son as he was now old enough to remember the separation and his mother’s erratic behavior. There was a period of calm after this where my wife would tell everyone what “an amazing Christian man” I was for fighting so hard for our marriage after she abandoned it. Yet, that time came to an end in 2017. I had started a consulting business and gotten us completely out of debt except for some student loans. All was well. In 2017 my consulting business failed, and I was only able to get part-time work. My wife who has a teaching degree refused to look for a full-time job and we became very financially stressed. My wife withdrew even farther from me. She had never really accepted the role of “wife”, she just wanted to be married and have a baby; she has admitted this many times over the years to our counselors and pastors. Yet, the Bible does not give us an “out” from marriage based on hard times, and I will never accept divorce as an option. Unfortunately, State law does not care about God’s word and my wife has yet again filed for divorce in late 2018. Prior to my wife filing for divorce this time, she maxed out every credit card in my name, overdrew accounts, set-up hidden bank accounts, and finally got a full-time job so she would have a source of income; I was still struggling to find full-time employment and had no means to hire an attorney. My wife told me very openly that she had met with her attorney 9 months prior to filing and was very open about the intent to make it so that I could not afford an attorney. She was also very open that everything she had done for the pervious 9 months was to set me up so that I had no choice but to give her our son and go away. She stated that I could always get remarried and have another kid… Here we are again, except this time my son (who just turned 8 years old) is being devastated by her actions. As the person who filed, she immediately got Temporary Custody of our son; funny how the one who abandons marriage gets rewarded. In April of 2019 I became aware that my wife was verbally and emotionally abusing our son. My son reported he wanted to die and would hurt himself every day. It had been happening for months, and my wife had hidden this from me. I immediately picked-up my son from school and called Child Protective Services and an investigation was launched…then it got very bizarre. When I spoke with the CPS Investigator, I informed him of the long history of abuse allegations by my wife and provided well over a dozen witnesses who could confirm her past allegations and erratic behavior. Yet, the CPS Investigator never interviewed a single witness. Instead, he became convinced that I was terrifying my wife and that I had told my son to threaten suicide and hurt himself because I did not want a divorce; I am very open about my Christianity and why I am opposed to divorce, because it is not Biblical and it destroys children. The CPS Investigator was very clear that he did not have a Biblical perspective, and even stated that no child should be taught the Bible because it makes a parent look bad and it is manipulation of the child. My wife convinced this CPS Investigator that our son had never been taught the Bible until she filed for divorce and that I only taught him the Bible to make him hate her. She made numerous other allegations of abuse (allegations that I told him she would make and gave witnesses to refute them), and this CPS Investigator became convinced that I was manipulating my son and had been abusing them for years. The Investigator called me on the phone and made these allegations to me but stated he “had no proof…just a gut feeling” that I was doing exactly what I said my wife would accuse me of. I recorded this phone conversation because I had the feeling something was very wrong, and it turns out I was correct. This Investigator also went into our Family Court at an emergency hearing and told the Judge he believed I was using the Bible to brainwash my child, that I had told my son to hurt himself and threaten suicide, and that I was trying to manipulate my son because I do not believe in divorce. I immediately filed a complaint with the State of Texas and this Investigator was fired, but the damage was done. I will be suing Texas Department of Family and Protective Services for his misconduct, but for now all my energy is focused on saving my son from wanting to kill himself; no 8-year-old should ever want to die. Due to the “testimony” presented by this now fired CPS Investigator, the Judge labeled me an abuser took away ALL contact with my son except for Supervised Visitation once a week at a CPS office. I did these visits for 6 weeks until CPS refused to have any contact with me; they found out I had recorded the Investigator, his Supervisors, and Regional Administrators when I had talked with them on the phone. Once CPS knew I had audio recordings of them admitting to breaking the law, they ceased all contact with me and will only communicate with me through their legal team. Yet, this does not change the opinion of the Judge who is still convinced I am an abuser, even though CPS has subsequently testified on 3 different occasions that there “is no evidence” I have done any of the things I have been accused of. Luckily, the final trial will not be heard by this Associate Judge, but by the District Judge who has not been tainted by the false allegations. The problem is that I have been financially ruined by my wife and her attorneys, constantly being called into court to answer false abuse allegations and Restraining Orders. Prior to filing for divorce, my wife maxed out every single credit card I had in my name, hid what little money we had in a separate bank account, then got a full-time teaching job. They have bombarded me with motions and summons with the express goals of ruining me financially so that I would have to agree to their terms. I was so broke that I could not get an attorney for 4 months after she filed, but have sold items, borrowed from family to try and get representation, and am now utterly ruined financially. I am now about 30 days away from trial and no money for an attorney. I have borrowed all the money I can from family and have sold everything of value except my car. I will default on every line of credit I have this month, and I have no way to pay legal fees. My wife’s plan has been worked to perfection, and my son will end up living with a Borderline alcoholic who presents herself very well until you live with her. My son will will not have his father there to be a buffer for her erratic and abusive behavior and has now become the focus of her sometimes-loving behavior and sometimes-hateful outbursts. She is constantly denying me all access to my son, knowing I cannot afford to pay an attorney. I do not know why this is happening, I fully trust our Lord, but I desperately need relief. That is why I have opened this page.",
720,"TW. New. Confused. Sad.TW: abuse (sexual, verbal, emotional), suicide, drug abuse, alcoholism... &#x200B; Pretext: New here. This is bound to be a bit rambly and ranty as I only recently discovered there's a whole community who might understand, and I feel the need to give good context to this current situation. A lot of my background discusses my parents as a unit, but I promise this is primarily about my mom. Also, just to get it out of the way, I do have a therapist, he is wonderful, and he is familiar with all this. &#x200B; Background: I was born into a large extended family, so tight-knit I couldn't see all the shit swept under the rug for years. Family was the highest priority, and if you asked little intheFrOG, I would have said it was loving and supportive! I was happy. (Generally. Looking back, I did have anxiety since I could remember, which resulted in a few meltdowns. I recall one particular incident when I was maybe 8 years old and I remember being so scared of ....something.... that I had to run away. I didn't, my mom stopped me.) Things were good overall, as far as I was aware, until middle school. In middle school, I met a bunch of wonderful people, many of whom are still my friends to this day. They encouraged me to come out of my shell and opened my eyes to a lot of what's out there. (Up until this point, I had zero interests/exposures outside of what my parents approved of. I didn't have any idea what pop music/culture was like, I didn't wear anything my parents didn't pick out for me, I had no friends my parents didn't approve of.) My first couple weeks of middle school were a crash course in pop culture, interpersonal relations, and sex ed. I felt so grown up, having interests and experiences outside of my parents, and I loved (most) of it. Talk of sex made me extremely uncomfortable. It felt dirty, and *wrong*, just to talk about it. It felt bad to joke about it. I ended up getting so bent out of shape, stressing about the whole thing, that I was losing sleep, withdrawing into myself. But I had a problem, and parents are there to help solve problems, right? So, I approached my mom. I explained how I was feeling, and how I didn't understand why this felt so bad. My mom said I didn't react that way when we had ""the talk"" and asked why I didn't bring this up then. I was confused... because we never had the ""birds and the bees"" talk. I found out everything from my friends at school. Of course, I said that, and my mom got angry. She treated me like she caught me in a lie, and about my emotional issues regarding sex said two things: 1. sex is part of life, so you're gonna have to get over it. 2. ""Well honey... \*SIGH\*... I want you to know that I was sexually abused by a family member when I was a child, so if this is something you ever need to discuss, I want you to know you can talk to me."" I remember walking out of the room after that conversation completely baffled. Why was my mom claiming we had a sex talk? Why did she give me such conflicting messages? Who said anything about sexual assault?????? A few weeks later, my cousin/best friend ran away from home to escape what had become constant sexual abuse from my uncle. I was distraught. This was worsened by my parents telling me that they ""couldn't believe she was so promiscuous to seduce him"" and that they ""were so glad they still had control over"" me. I think understandably, my grades took a hit. Middle school is hard enough, let's add family drama, a missing best friend, a pedophile uncle, wild and (in hindsight) inappropriate discomfort talking about sex, and my first real tension with my parents. My parents were less than understanding. They got mad and stayed mad for the rest of the school year. Nothing major, but there was a new, underlying anger. Another thing at play here was the fact I was beginning to hate myself. Perhaps because my life felt like it was falling apart, I think it was more likely that I was just a 13-year-old girl. Regardless, I was. I hated myself, which made me look for distractions. Distractions meant I was putting off responsibility (homework) which meant my grades suffered which made me feel like a failure which made me hate myself. Not shockingly, this continued. It got slowly but steadily worse over the next few years. Evolving in such small increments that the change didn't register. My mom developed migraines, and on her ""headache days"" she turned mean. She would apologize profusely the next day, in the beginning. Then it turned into a simple apology. Then a shrug of acknowledgment. Then nothing, her comments were to be expected, as it was expected that I had already forgiven her because she had a headache. Her comments lost their sting as time went on, as well, but as I grew used to one, she would bring out another. ""You're lazy"" turned into ""you're a bitch"" turned into ""I'm not surprised XYZ hates you"". Now, for context here, my relationship with my dad got worse too. I will come back to my mom, and this is primarily about my mom, but I think this is important to understand everything. My dad was much more aggressive. He is an angry drunk and was blacked out most nights. He did not like me. This resulted in some brutal confrontations. Whatever was bothering him at the time did not matter, as he would call me into the living room and ""talking"" to me was his stress release. It didn't matter how it started, the ending was always the same. Sometimes he wanted to ""debate"" current issues. (No matter my position, it was wrong.) Sometimes he was mad about something I did or didn't do. Sometimes he would frame it as a ""learning experience"" ie. ""I'm mad about something at work. If you don't do better in school, you're going to be like this person. You aren't even trying in school. Oh, you are? Then you're too stupid to be in society. Now thank me for motivating you to do better."" Not going into the room wasn't an option. Neither was arguing back or giving any sort of response other than being stoic and saying what he wanted me to say. He never hit me, but it was also never a guarantee that he wouldn't. He was very good at drawing lines in the sand and then barely crossing them. Drawing another, and crossing it. It was enough to make me feel completely unsafe, but also sound crazy if I ever talked about it. ""My dad's crazy! He yelled at me!"" Like, yeah, okay. The closest he came to physical was chasing me into my room and cornering me. He never got closer than maybe two feet from me, but it terrified me. He also threw things not AT me but in my direction. But worse than that was the constant threat of being kicked out of my house. It was never promised that I would have a roof over my head the next day, and that messed with me. The other thing he did, which honestly I loved, was he would give me the silent treatment. He wanted to ""show (me) how little (I) actually matter to (his) life."" It always ended up hurting, but let me tell you, those first 48 hours after he decided I don't exist? Pure bliss. As long as I stayed out of his way (physically, because his ignoring me went to the point of pretending I was literally not there, so he would hit me with doors and whatnot if I was in the way) I was fine. No yelling, no name-calling. I would have an extra hour or two a day to do whatever I wanted because I wasn't standing in the living room getting my head ripped off. After those two days though, anxiety set in because he could flip the switch and come after me with a vengeance, and I never knew when that was coming. Also, the pain, because even though I was an older child, I was still a CHILD and having a parent spend up to 3 weeks straight demonstrating that I don't matter hurt. Anyway, back to mother dear. She had and continues to have a very distinct pattern. Comfort me when I'm low, make me feel loved, take it all back. When my dad would be done with me and I was obviously distraught, my mom would swoop in. Gently knock on the door, ask if I'm okay. Sit beside me, hold my hand. Make me feel like maybe I was...okay? And I fell for it. Every time. Of course, she would conveniently turn a blind eye to what was happening in the moment. As soon as my dad started to raise his voice, she would disappear to do something somewhere else in the house. He's threatening to kick me out, loud enough that my neighbor told me she was going to call the cops next time, and my mom is in the room above us apparently suffering from transient deafness. But I was alone and scared, and my mom comforted me. And I would lean on that...until my mom had a ""headache day"" or got mad about something, or my dad got mad again. And then suddenly my mom is tearing up my photos off my door, complaining about how awful I am on the phone, etc. etc. etc. Not as direct, rarely in my face. But intentional and damaging nevertheless. For the sake of brevity, (ha) I'm going to skip a few stories and save those for another day. We jump now to the biggest fight, which occurred when I was 17 years old. My mom had been in a car accident which left her unable to drive or lift anything remotely heavy for a while. Due to the fact that my dad worked full time and my sibling was a preteen, running the house (shuttling sibling to and from school and therapy, sitting with them while they were suicidal, getting groceries, planning meals, bringing my mom to appointments, etc.) fell on me. I can only assume my mom took my doing all this as me falling into line of some sort...whatever her reason, she decided one night that we needed to talk about a ""family situation"". This ""situation"" was that my uncle (who I saw regularly) (yes the one who raped my cousin) (yes also the one who \*spoiler\* molested my sibling) (yes the very same one who \*double spoiler alert\* molested me) was **the family member who molested my mom**. Turns out, it was common knowledge amongst all the adults that this uncle is a pedophile. But it's okay because he was beaten up for making CP when he was a teenager. (Clearly, that didn't stop him, as he was in his 40's when he was messing with my sibling and I but my mom had no response to that point.) She also tried to tell me that, well, SHE survived it, so I'll be fine. She thought it was ""more important that (I) have a relationship with the family than (Uncle) gets stopped"". I was disgusted, and I told her so. She literally brought me over to the house of a known pedophile, whose abuse she experienced first hand, and let me spend time with him. Go swimming in his pool. Let him take me on (short, granted) trips ALONE. When I got mad she was shocked. She said I can't be mad because she's a victim. I pointed out that someone can be a victim AND an abuser and the former doesn't justify the latter. She told me I was victim-blaming. This conversation ended with us agreeing to disagree... at 17, I felt this problem was way over my head, and decided that I would just try to get through the next couple years until I could get out. (Potentially of note, at the time of this conversation, I wasn't fully confident I had been molested. I thought my memories were bad dreams because I couldn't remember details. And until this conversation, I thought it wasn't a realistic possibility.) As one would expect, things did not get significantly better from this point, until I went to college. Some physical distance between my parents and I did a load of good, and being able to live my life just for me was amazing. Until my mom decided ""(she) wasn't ready for (me) to leave the house yet"" and I got pulled from college. I had no money to pay for school (or an apartment) and I was going to get no financial aid if my parents were on my FAFSA, so I was stuck, it seemed. Things were worse than ever before (my parents put a keylogger on all the computers in the house, restricted food I was allowed to eat, regularly gave my stuff to my sibling. Privacy was not a thing; my phone was gone through, no lock or latch on the bathroom door or my door. My mom would regularly go into my room for god only knows what reason. I started living in a disgusting living space because it was the only way to deter my mom.) Until my parents randomly decided that they were going to pay for me to go to a trade school, and my options were either I take this program or I get out of their house by the end of the week. I decided an education was going to let me get more money so I could go back to school and get my life back on track, and I didn't have anywhere else to go, so I went for it. Plenty happened between then and 2019, but I'm going to skip it as it isn't directly pertinent to my current situation. Imagine some ups, mostly downs, a move halfway across the continent, my wedding, and a very fragile, big mistake of a reconciliation with my mother. As crazy as it sounds, I honestly forgot how bad things were that happened. I got used to them, didn't think about them, and next thing I knew, they were out of mind. November 2019. My best friend, while staying at my house, attempted suicide by overdosing on pills. I called my mom, looking for some sort of comfort. In that phone call, she convinced me that we couldn't handle moving on our own, and she was flying out. (My SO supported whatever I thought was necessary/whatever I wanted. My mom and I had been pretty good for a while, so as obvious of a bad idea as this is to you now, we were thankful she was coming out.) Things got increasingly stressful the week she was here... instead of focusing on moving and dealing with emotions, my time was now split between moving, dealing with emotions, and entertaining our ""guest"". But it came to a head the last night. My SO went to bed, and my mom and I stayed up talking. Just catching up on people we hadn't seen in a while, pleasant conversation. My mom offered to pay an unexpected bill that came up while she was here. I was hesitant, but she insisted. The bill wasn't one I was particularly comfortable pushing off, and honestly if someone is willing to give me money, sure. I expressed my gratitude by saying (essentially) that I owed her one. (I KNOW, okay? I feel like I was walking into a basement in a horror movie. Predictable and stupid.) It seemed the instant my mom heard I felt indebted to her, the very moment I felt comfortable relying on her, it switched. We had to talk about a ""family situation"". This time, it's revealed that my dad is abusing her. She also reminded me that my parents' retirement plan is to move in with my husband and I. And she told me her mother is on the brink of dying. Drawing me in, it would seem? Laying on the guilt, making me feel bad. I go so far as to hypothesize that she was trying to put the idea in my head to invite her to move in if/when she leaves my dad. And I kind of just nodded along, let her go on. Until she suggested that my SO and I move back to our home town. This has been a point of contention between us of late. My mom insists that despite neither of us wanting to move back, and despite the fact we have careers in our current location, and despite everything and anything we tell her, that we should move back to her town before we get pregnant because she ""can't imagine me being pregnant without her there"". And just....no. I told her that and now she's shut me out. &#x200B; Current situation: As pathetic as it might be, it really only just dawned on me that my mom is still pulling her same shit, and I'm still falling for it. My dad and I have a much more stable relationship as of now. I've intentionally created a facade of a good relationship with him that he very much believes. We don't talk much, and when we do it's small talk, but he thinks we're close. Good. I have thought up until now that I didn't need his approval or apology for my healing, so why would I talk about it with him? All it would do is hurt him, and I wouldn't benefit, so...I didn't see a point. My mom thinks our relationship is significantly better than it really is, in part because *I* thought it was better than it really is. But now I realize that this whole relationship is shitty, and just because it's not something I'm experiencing every day actively, I'm still dealing with it. I'm in therapy regularly, but this latest run through my mom's pattern of pulling me in and pushing me away has me pretty fucked up. And I'm tired. I'm tired of all of this. I'm tired of the constant drama, the anxiety and anticipation of if and when I'll hear from either of them. So I think I know what I need to do, and that is essentially NC. My SO and I are agreed (and have been for years now) that my parents would have very restricted, supervised access to our kids. We are trying (and have been for a while) so part of me wants to wait until we are pregnant and use that as an excuse to bring up everything... part of me wants to ghost my entire family now. Most of me wants to talk to them, and explain my problems, and inform them WHY I'm doing this, and give them a chance to reflect and maybe change. Complications: First, change? ha. Even I realize that is unreasonable. Both my parents need help, and neither is willing to get it. My mom tried to get my dad to go, and he straight out refused. He said, according to my mom, his ""demons will consume"" him if he ""opens the box"". Heavily implying he is suicidal, to some degree. My mom said she has gone but doesn't like it. Maybe my talking to them, explaining there are issues, will convince them to try? Well, no. My dad does not respect me. He does not respect my opinion, and to this day thinks I'm a bad kid. I'm almost 30, married, stable job. Never been arrested, never even snuck out. I mean I accidentally stole something when I walked out of the store holding it once..... I'm being facetious. I'm not a bad person, and I honestly never gave my parents trouble. And he has made comments recently about how I need to learn to respect authority. (To him, HE is authority, no matter who he is speaking to. His boss? Well he's the authority on his job, so respect him. His employees? He's the boss, so respect him. Etc.) So even if I say anything, he will just chalk it up to me being bad/causing drama/disrespecting him/whatever. My mom is way more complex. She is delusional, and I don't say that lightly. She literally lives inside a little bubble of reality that is completely separate from the rest of the world. She has no friends, only our family. She surrounds herself with people who support this bubble. She has proudly told me that she doesn't care what people mean, she takes what they say as she wants to hear it. (Ex. Someone could tell my mom her shirt is ugly, and my mom will take it as a compliment because that must mean she has prettier shirts, so therefore this someone is telling my mom she has good style.) She is impossible to speak sense to because her logic is twisted. She has memories of things that never happened (like our sex talk) and absolutely no memory of things that 100% did happen. (She called one of my bridesmaids a whore in her very first interaction with her. ""Hi, I'm intheFrOG's mom, you must be her whore friend?"" This was in a public place. Multiple people told me this happened. None of them were joking or had any reason to lie.) I know - I KNOW - that if I attempt to talk to her about this, she will shut down. She'll blame me, call me names. Deny deny deny. This is why she doesn't like therapy and stopped going. Going to therapy means bursting her little fake reality bubble, and she wasn't willing to do that. So I suppose I'm asking for advice. What do I do? Do I try to talk to them, even though it will almost certainly not work, and will release unprecedented vitriol? Do I ghost them, and break their hearts? Do I wait until I'm pregnant, and use that as an excuse to bring things up? Do I start a fight so this doesn't feel out of the blue? If my mom's mother is dying, is this a particularly cruel time? What am I supposed to say? ""Yes hello mom I know we've been fine for like 8 months but suddenly I never want to talk to you again because of something that happened 10 years ago."" Ugh. Thanks guys. Edit: Removed ranty/rhetorical questions regarding my uncle. I know this isn't the place to look for any advice regarding that situation, I sorta was just talking at that point.",
721,"Long overdue update to Crazy MIL who kidnapped my husbandTW: mentions of Suicide & Abuse This is so long and doesnt even skim the surface, but I promised an update to this: https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/clu7iq/mil_has_held_my_husband_hostage_literally_and/ Brace yourselves... Too much happened and its been a rollercoaster ride. New things come to light every day..I want to be very careful incase my psychotic in laws are scanning this forum. Husband has been NC. I tried, like an idiot, to extend an olive branch so that he can be in communication with one of his brothers at least and have some support outside of me. I contacted my BILs wife (the one who had been pissed about his parents behavior when I stood up for myself) and told her I needed to make sure this was a safe place for my husband and that they would not inject their negative opinions of his wife to him because it brings aggression into my home and puts us in danger. (Definitely found the link between my husbands past violence and abuse to that toxic poison his family put to wedge us apart...makes sense. Abuse is a respect issue..) SIL seemed to understand at first and agree. She was amicable and supportive but the next day accused me of being controlling and terrible for keeping him away from his parents who are worried sick (I'm not....I give my husband the choice. I don't take his phone or car keys away like his sick mother did to keep him from his wife...) Im assuming she once again, involved our MIL. I let her know he has communicated to his parents that he needed space and them to respect that space so he could work on his marriage. She didn't believe me. She then told me to have his doctor call her and let her know why her brother in law who she barely knows needs to stay away from his parents right now... She said everyone needs their parents and then tried to somehow argue that his mother was right for stripping a grown man of his autonomy and lying to him that he was under some sort of suicide watch and would be sent to the hospital if he dared to contact his wife or come home. I told her I made a mistake contacting her, and she implied that I was selfish for taking up her time and not respecting her boundaries all of a sudden...yeah..I don't understand either...I feel like she was my last effort. Last year she was supportive and had initially reached out and was upset at his parents selfish involvment in my husband's life and devaluation of me for sticking up to his abuse. I'm sad that she's now infected with that sick controlling cloud now too. I guess I didn't want to see how everyone was toxic in the family. It makes me sad for my husband. And then sometimes I realize that I think I'm more sad and guilty about the NC then he is. I've never seen him this happy and relaxed. We cannot talk about his family..thats the soft spot he is triggered by but he is going to therapy for...but he is happy. If he misses them, he sure isn't showing it. He smiles more. Laughs. Is excelling at work. Creating more art. More loving and sweet. And there aren't any things being broken or screaming or emotional upset (as long as I don't bring up his family). He's..comfortable. I dont have any other way to describe it. He seems human for once. I don't know if our marriage is irreparably damaged by all this crazy shit, but I'm happy that he can breathe. That he has maybe found a new way. And I have faith that with therapy, he can find long term happiness, if not with me, then with someone else and more importantly, himself. I am also at peace. I found a new therapist for myself who echos the same as all of you did. Our old therapist was compromised, possibly enmeshed by his mother as well, and at the very least, absolutely unethical, uneducated, and contributed to damaging our marriage and putting both our lives at risk. I was urged to contact old therapist and get my file. I've contacted via text, calls, emails. Nada. Our old therapist hasn't responded, and I will be filing a complaint against her with the state. It also came to light that this whole time while she was implying that my husband would be home if he wanted to be, she was telling my husband who was begging to be able to come home that staying with his mother and going no contact with me was the only way he could ever have a shot in hell in fixing this marriage....my husband, who was so against filing a complaint against her was pissed when he found out that I had not been given the same knowledge that she was issuing a no contact for the betterment of our marriage....hes on board now and feels betrayed by her. We paid this woman who took us individually at first and then as a marriage counselor. We paid her to repair our marriage and she gave us both tools to put communication blocks up and then supported his mother's kidnapping of him and lied to both of us about the intention. It was two days prior to my husband going to the hospital that I brought up enmeshment and she shut the idea down and refused to even talk about it. ""He's not enmeshed with his mother."" It also took me all this time to realize that when I did exactly what she told me to do, ""ignore my husband when an argument came up"" and silenced my phone, this is exactly what triggered my husband into his suicide attempt. She knew his triggers. Knew the tools she gave us were cause for emotional distance. Took our money. Lied to us both. Made our issues worse and supported the actions of a mentally ill mother holding her son hostage. And now she is refusing to release my file...I am seriously just waking up to all of this. As you will see from my last post I defended her actions. It's no wonder the drs she assigned my husband were all of a sudden uncomfortable taking my husband's case. I just learned she got elected to be my State's Suicide and Victim's advocate. She's still not licensed... No, I'm not defending my husband's role in all this. He absolutely was an abuser. He didnt treat me with respect. I've stood up to him and will continue to. And I also don't advise anyone stick with abusers.. He, like most abusers..was abused as a child and even as an adult into our marriage. And he was absolutely encouraged to devalue and disrespect me. I had no idea the influence his family had on him until recently. But I see what the lack of the influence has done for him. I'm speaking about this now in case anyone out there needs to see how absolutely important it is to understand. In case you're a woman who is wondering if you're insane or crazy or controlling. All the things that had been seeded into my psyche since my involvement in this weird family, kept me from seeing the truth, ruined my relationship, kept me isolated, stripped me of my worth. I want to start contributing more to this sub talking about the weird things I'm just now waking up to. The lies and doubt's. There's a lot of things that are so incredibly sick here that were normalized. I want to make it clear that I am in no way condoning sticking with a partner who is abusive. If I could do it all again, I wouldn't. My physical health has been affected and I almost lost my business over this. I want to say how important recognizing the signs of indirect and direct abuse from your partner's family is. And if you have a JustNo MIL who is on the extreme side, and still has her hooks deep into your SO, it's so important to recognize the signs and leave or get a therapist for both of you that specializes in toxic families in particular. I loved my MIL and was so blind to everything. I allowed her to strip away my entire identity and think I was someone else and an awful wife. She convinced the whole family, my husband and eventually me that I was. And throughout all of this I was blind to my complete worship of her. My husband and I just realized I hadn't been to the movies or to a restaurant together just the two of us for a basic outing or date in 6 years. I was too busy setting him up on dates with his mother and hating myself to even notice this, all the while still being accused by his family that he doesn't see his mother enough...she abused me through other members of the family. Yes, they all are at fault but they bought into it just like I did, and still are. As my sister in law who I also had reservations about came to bat for me last year on her own now clearly has been dragged into this weird way of thinking. Last week my husband came to my therapist with me. She wanted to hear from him why he didnt just call me, get his phone and call me or come home when his mother had him held hostage. He said that she had threatened to call the doctors and he would be admitted back into the hospital (something he's already communicated to me) but something new he said, I didnt even notice at the time and she brought it up when he left.. ""Because my mom said I wasn't in my right mind.."" This has alarm bells ringing in my therapists head and she is also scared for my husband. Because his mom said... They were going to put him on tranquilizers and a bunch of other mind numbing medications when all this was going on. My husband was so indoctrinated in the worship of his mother that he just believed every single word she said and thought he was incapable of choice because of this sick woman..- this had me thinking of something so creepy husband had said when he finally was able to talk to me for 5 min after I told our old therapist that its BS not knowing if my husband is alive or dead and his mom is controlling a 40 year old mans access to his phone and wife..when he called immediately after, he had said he would be better because they were gonna give him lots of medicine. (He was talking like a little kid at this point and it was terrifying to me) he said, ""and you can get help too. You can get medicine too and go to the hospital and get better."" I am so grossed the fuck out by this, guys... What's weird is, my husband and I, for the last few months of NC have all of a sudden fixed our 'crazy' with out medication....in case you need another jolt of wtf, I'd like to remind you that his mother is a nurse and is often responsible for administering medication to people who aren't exactly able to do so themselves...yeah.. There are people skilled at manipulation so terrifying its shocking. So I guess the important lesson here is, know yourself and never allow anyone to try and redefine your identity. And if something doesnt feel right, its probably not. Don't ever let anyone make you question your reality, or call you crazy or controlling. And never let them make you think you're sick. Maybe you are. But get the opinion of someone not connected to that crazy train to tell you that. And when you're a people pleaser like me, remain extra vigilant and take notice when people are taking advantage of that. If you're wiser than I was, you are so lucky and probably don't have to be told this, but just in case: DO NOT LEAVE YOUR CHILDREN ALONE WITH THESE PEOPLE. Children lack the tools or awareness to defend themselves against this weird abuse. If you are even on this sub, it is likely because your husband was a victim to a manipulative mother who is attempting to manipulate your marriage now. Don't let your children be subjected to that. Even if you and your husband are a united front, trust that at one point he was a victim of his mother. If she didnt have the power over him at one point in his life, she wouldn't even attempt to now. And if you have kids, don't think they are not being sized up by her. Don't feel guilty about protecting your family, especially if you have children. Like I said, don't know if our marriage will last, but we are currently working on getting a support system set up for my husband that doesnt have a manipulative agenda, and that's all that matters. Love to all of you. Thank you for all the responses on my last post. They helped me not succumb to believing I was the crazy controlling one. TL,DR: Still coming out of the fog. Realizing DH & I were both being abused by MIL and who knows how deep the lies go with the family and our previous therapist. Untangling mess with new Therapist and trying to get to the truth.",
722,"My Near-Death Experience (16 years ago)**I grew up in a dysfunctional household.** I don't want to get too much into the details, but my parents were unstable and mostly fighting until they separated. My two siblings and I had been emotionally, psychologically and physically abused. We had no feeling of safety or well-being in our home. It felt like a very loveless home too. And on top of all of that, financial worries were a constant, and my mother would always broadcast that worry to us. It was a very stressful experience and I was robbed of a decent childhood. Overall my parents were horrible for each other and should never have had children. They brought us into a world of pain and suffering, and didn't provide us with a good life. The childhood years were very, very, very unsatisfying. **I have always been a sensitive person** The experience growing-up was very overwhelming on my nervous system. I suffered from almost daily migraines as a child. I felt emotionally frozen, I lacked social skills, and it was difficult for me to make friends or rely on anyone -- not just because I lacked the social skills needed to be a good friend, but also because my home was not a place I would ever bring good people (because our home environment was toxic and embarassing). In elementary school I would befriend my classmates, and I would have enough of a social life that I didn't have to worry. But by the time I was in middle school, I was already feeling isolated like nobody liked me. As I went into high school, this feeling got worse with each year, until I was completely disowned by my peers at the age of 15-16ish. There was nothing worse than feeling alone and isolated, being rejected by my peers. Going to school was an anxiety inducing experience where I didn't feel welcome. Going home each night, I felt so tired of my life. There was nothing positive or satisfactory about it already, and now that I was disowned by my peer group, I just felt completely like I had absolutely no reason to live. **Life was misreable for me** I was suffering silently. I didn't feel like I had anyone I could talk to about my problems. Back then, I also didn't understand that there was any other way of life. This was the only life I knew, I didn't know that other people had a better life experience, that other people had loving families, that I could talk to a therapist or councillor about my feelings. So to me, it just felt like a very hopeless situation, but I didn't know that it wasn't normal. I started seriously thinking about suicide and my options to do so. It was an obsession, a compulsion on a daily basis. I dreamed of walking in front of a public transit bus on my way home from school. **The problem with suicide was** ... Having grown-up in a catholic household, I was worried that if I killed myself, there was the possibility of eternal damnation. Because catholicism claims that if you commit suicide, that's you rejecting your most precious gift from god, and therefore you will go to hell for eternity for this desecration. By this age, I was already starting to notice a lot of inconsistencies in catholicism. When I was 12, I had stopped going to church, I was the first of my siblings to stand-up for myself and opt-out. So by the age of 15-16, I was already not attending church at all. But having grown-up with those beliefs and having gone to catholic schools, I was still worried, ""What if catholicism is right?"" ""If I kill myself, it might be a critical mistake. Eternity is a long time... It's just not worth it....."" So I still fantasized about suicide, but because of my fear of hell, I wasn't ready to go through with it. **Then one Saturday morning** As I was waking up in my bedroom and looking at the ceiling, I noticed the sun was coming through the window. But I felt there was a problem. My heart stopped beating. I couldn't breath. I tried to bang on the floor of my bedroom to get help, but my body was not responding. I knew that this was it -- I was going to die. When you are dying, you know the feeling, it's unmistakenable. Still terrified of damnation, I remembered my catholic teachings, that even if you lived a life of sin, on your deathbed as long as you repent and ask Jesus to save you, you will get into heaven. So there I was, unable to speak, but screaming in my mind, ""Jesus forgive me!! Save me!! yadda yadda ..."" **It didn't take long** I got sucked through a beam of white light. Other people who have reported an NDE describe it as a tunnel of white light. To me, it felt more like a drinking straw (notice I used the term ""sucked through"" earlier, like you would slurp a drink). The reason I say that is because I instantly noticed -- I'm too big to fit. I'll have to leave this body behind to get through. So I could actually feel myself getting sucked-out of my body, and it was an incredible experience, because the body was a heavy, emotionally depressing burden. **The next moment ...** I found myself on the other side. I had left my heavy, sad, depressed body behind. All that emotional baggage was separated from me. Now I felt perfectly **weightless and free**. It felt like taking off a tight shoe after a long walk, except this tight shoe was my body. It was whole and satisfying relief to be free from that body. I perceived myself to be floating above the Earth, it seemed like the distance to the moon perhaps, that's how small the Earth now appeared as I observed it in a distance. **But I was in a place of pure bliss ...** Surrounded by a cloud of perfectly satisfying love. There was absolutely no sense of lack in this moment. I felt whole and complete. I felt easy and weightless. I felt happy and joyful. I immediately recognized this place, I have been here before. I remember that I have been here recently too, but when I was sent back, the memory was taken away from me. I've been here frequently, it's not a rare occurence. **Beside me I noticed two beings** I could feel their presence, but they did not necessarily have any shape. One seemed smaller and did not speak, just observed. But the other seemed larger, wiser, and was the one communicating with me. I felt like I knew them in some way, I felt that they knew me too, it's just that I couldn't remember who they were. But I knew that the big one was my guide or someone who has been keeping track of me. I mean, they both knew everything about my life, but the big one felt like he might have been a representative for me. But unlike other people who had an NDE, neither of them would I describe as Jesus or God. They were just really powerful, wise, and loving beings. **The guide began communicating with me** The communication was not with words, it was through instant thought-blocks. The moment the communication started, it felt like every moment I was downloading not just individual words or sentence, but entire concepts & ideas. Even more than that, these thought-blocks included EVERYTHING -- memories of the Earthly events that inspired the intention for the thought-block, the feelings I had when I experienced that event, as well as how these beings felt as they observed me having that experience. These thought-blocks were instant, conveyed huge amounts of information, and they were so complete that there was no room for mis-understanding (like we do here on Earth when we mis-communicate and have frustrating conversations with someone). As we communicated, I got a sense that these beings appreciated me deeply and fully, and had great reverance for me. And I felt great reverance for these beings, for the empathy they had for me, and I was impressed with their wisdom and knowledge. **The first topic of discussion** The being started by showing me that they had been observing how unhappy I was in my life. They showed me the memory and emotion of my life experiences, of the sadness, hopelessness, despair, lack of satisfaction. And as they showed me this memory and my feelings in that moment, they also showed me how seeing me in that experience made them feel very sad. They could see that I was stuck, and this was causing me a lot of suffering and pain. And they felt great sympathy for the pain I was experiencing, because they didn't want me to continue suffering, they wanted me to feel the tremendous love (like I was feeling in their presence right then). So after showing me this memory, the guide told me... ""we do not want you to suffer, we see you are in great pain, do you want to stay here or do you want to go back \[to Earth\]?"" (suggesting that they can now free me from the suffering) They knew I wanted to kill myself, and they were offering me a less messy option. **They gave me the choice to leave my body.** And as they communicated this, they simultaneously showed me an understanding -- **there is no such thing as hell**. They showed me that they have nothing but appreciation for me and all living beings, that they feel nothing but unconditional love for me, and they want me to know this love fully. And they showed me that hell is a human-made concept, created from a human perspective of fear and not-knowing of the love of god. As I basked in this loving energy, I knew without a shadow of a doubt that this was true, that such a loving being would never reject its own creation, and in fact, felt great sympathy for the ones that were so lost and that suffered as a result. **Thinking if I should leave this world ...** As I considered my choice, I instantly remembered my pre-birth intention. I remembered that before I was born, I had a group of joker-type friends and we watched the world from this similar top-down perspective above the Earth. And those from our group would decide to take physical form, and we would see them be born into the world, and it was a competitive-like feeling..... we wanted to see who could go the longest before they got lost in the Earth indoctrination process (and subsequently, forget about their divine non-physical nature). We would be laughing hysterically as we watched our friends get lost and make really bad decisions, like ""oh man, can't believe he did that!"" sort of thing. Because just moments earlier, he was right here beside us, saying ""alright guys, I could do way better than you, just watch......"", so confident in himself. And just moments later, we would watch as he had absolutely no more memory or recollection of his divine nature, completely believing that he was this physical body, and that there was nothing but this physical realm (thinking that there was nothing after death, no god, etc). But as we continued to watch, I felt great sympathy for my friends. I watched so many people on this planet losing their way, and resulting in a lot of suffering, pain, despair. Overall, it looked like the state of the world was going downhill too, lots of unrest and fighting. It was really affecting me, and I felt great sympathy for the people. So that was when I set my pre-birth intention... I said, ""I will go into this physical world, and I will take physical form, but I will never forget who I am... I will remember my divine nature, and I will help others to remember their own divine nature too, so that they can be freed from the bondage and enjoy life the way it was meant to be enjoyed."" **So there I was, given the option to leave ...** Realizing that I had in fact lost my way too, and I had forgotten about my purpose. My childhood was just too painful. And with the medical condition (migraines), the loveless household, the religious indoctrination, the emotional and physical abuse, the lack of friends, the lack of satisfaction in my life, I just felt so traumatized and hopeless by the experience, that there never seemed like an opportunity for me to be true to myself. (But I give myself credit that at the age of 12, I knew that religion was bullshit, I had enough connection to my intuitive guidance to feel that was true..... so my intuition was there all along, I just wasn't paying enough attention to it all those years, and I didn't have the courage to act on my internal guidance at that time.) So remembering my pre-birth intention, I just felt like I wasn't done. I felt there was more that I wanted to do (I also didn't want to die as a virgin, because I wanted to experience sex at least once in my life!) **Making a decision ...** So I decided that I would go back, but with conditions ... I would only go back if the beings would allow me to keep the memory of our interaction. Because growing up, I remembered that I had this interaction with these loving beings before too. I remember at least two interactions prior -- at the age of 7, and another around the age of 11 (in this incident, I think I may have actually died and been sent back to a parallel timeline, because I remember seeing my mother grieving my loss and I felt bad, I remember saying ""I should go back"", and they told me ""you can't go back into that one, it's already been decided in that timeline, we'll have to put you somewhere else"") But each time I was sent back, they took the memory of our interaction away from me! Every time I had the experience, I felt like ""wow, this is the most amazing thing ever, I need to tell all my friends and family about it, it would especially help my family that is going through so much difficulty!"" I remember feeling super-excited every time, ready to go back and to tell the whole world..... that there is no death, that there is an afterlife, and it's beautiful and the unconditional love feelings amazing..... that it's the best thing since sliced bread. But then I would go back into my body, and as I would awake, I remember feeling this **burning desire** to tell everyone something **really, really important**... But each time as I tried to remember what that was, I would only see a blank white light where my memory was supposed to be. So as I was having this interaction now, I knew that they were planning to take this memory away from me again. And I said, ""**THE ONLY WAY** I'm going back is if you let me keep the memory. Because I'm not going to go back, only to be lost again! It's too painful not knowing who I am. You need to let me keep the memory."" And they agreed. But then I remembered how much hardship there was because of the financial situation. And I added, ""And I don't want to worry about money anymore, I also don't want to have to work"" (especially because at this point of my life, I was feeling a lot of difficulty in getting a job). And they seemed to agree, although I'm still waiting on that part of the agreement. (Years later, I did end up working as a software developer earning more than $100K a year, never going to university or earning a degree to do it. But it has been difficult and stressful work, and I still don't feel like the money has been sufficient, especially lately with the real-estate prices growing so far out of proportion with salaries..... so I'm still expecting more ease in this domain of my life) **Moments later, I was back in my bedroom ...** My eyes opened and I could see the ceiling again. As I centered-back into my body, I was just completely blown-away by the experience that I just had. There was this huge ""wooooow"" feeling resonating in my body. I couldn't believe they let me keep the memory, I was expecting them to take it away again. My first thought was ""they let me keep it, holy shit!!"" I was **completely lucid** of everything that had just happened, I ran over to my computer (which was a few steps away from my bed, a desktop with a bulky-monitor circa 2003) and quickly typed-down all the details from my experience. I wanted to write down every single detail, because I never wanted to forget. After I finished typing, I walked downstairs to find my sister watching TV in the living room. I asked her, ""didn't you hear me banging on the floor of my bedroom?"" She said, ""nope, it's been completely quiet all morning."" I said, ""well, I just died in my sleep, had a conversation with god about my life, they offered me the chance to leave my body but I decided to come back, and then they let me keep the memory of our interaction, so I ran to my computer and wrote it all down."" She was just like ""wow, that sounds trippy."" **After-math of my experience** There was no immediate improvement in my life after my NDE, but I felt like I didn't need to run-away anymore. Life felt more manageable now. I remember that after I came back, I was finally free of the worry of hell and eternal damnation. In fact, I felt a lot of rage against religion for putting me in that position in the first place. Whenever anyone would question my not following of them to church, I would openly share that catholicism is a distortion of truth, and express my absolute hatred for organized religion. I didn't feel inclined to share my NDE story with my immediately family, because I didn't feel any connection to any of my family members. At school I didn't have any friends, so I didn't share my experience with them either. It was this thing that happened, but it happend for me -- not for anyone else. I didn't know how to integrate it back into my life, I didn't even see it as something that I would share with the world (being that I was still young, uncertain in myself, and with social anxiety and no social skills). I just went on living my life day by day, taking things less seriously, and just focused on graduating high school. There was this thought at the back of my mind that said ""if it gets too much, it's ok, because none of this will matter once high school is over... it seems big and important now, but the moment you leave school, none of this will matter anymore."" So that thought kept me going through periods of loneliness and hardship. **Years later ...** So up to this point in my life, the only spiritual teachings I had known were the catholic doctrine. In later years of high school, I also had a world religions class that briefly spoke about the other religions, like Buddhism, Islam, Judaism, Sikhism, Zoroastrianism, but not in much detail or conviction. I started spending time on online philosophy forums, specifically around that time MySpace was popular, so that's where I went for discussion (this was pre-reddit era, around the time that Digg was still the most popular social aggregator). One day I was having a discussion about some topic, and somebody mentioned ""The Secret"". They personally messaged me with a link where I could watch it online. That night I watched the whole thing and was blown away. Something about ""The Secret"" really resonated with me. It seemed to make a lot of sense to me, considering the negative environment that I had grown-up in had filled my head with a lot of self-deprecating and negative beliefs and thought patterns. It seemed to make sense that if I wanted a better life, I would have to start reaching for thoughts that were different. Then a couple weeks or months passed, and again someone messaged me directly on MySpace, but this time they told me to watch ""The Secret Behind The Secret"". Again, I had a link to watch it online somewhere..... This is when I knew I was on to something. Everything that was talked about in ""The Secret Behind The Secret"" was a direct reflection of my NDE. This was the first time that I recognized that another human being knew about the other side and what it is like. That DVD was my introduction to the New Age community. Since then, I have learned about a lot of the different teachers and concepts. Today I have a much more complete understanding of the physical reality and its connection to Source and the non-physical, I understand a lot more of the concepts and have a better lexicon so that I can share my story. **But back** **when I had my NDE** I didn't know anything about New Age or Spirituality. At most, I had seen Buddhism mentioned in The Simpons, I knew it was popular with celebrities. But I lived in a very sheltered world, I didn't even know there was an entire section called New Age / Self-Help at the library or in the book store. It was there all those years, I was just completely unaware that it even existed. But in a way, I'm happy that I didn't know about any of that. Because if I had known about those concepts back when I had my NDE, I would have thought that the NDE was just a dream based on all the things I had learned in the books. But this way, knowing how completely different my NDE was from my religious indoctrination, there was no shadow of doubt in my mind that the experience was real. **More real than physical reality** As other people who had an NDE explain, ""it feels realer than this physical reality, and it felt like going back home..."" One moment of being present in that shower of pure love is more satisfying than the most satisfying experience you've had in your entire life on this planet. Think back to your most satisfying experience ever -- maybe it was the most delicious meal that you've ever had, or your best sex ever, ..... Take that feeling and multiply it to infinity, such that the feeling never goes away, and it is just as satisfying tomorrow, and next year, as it is right now. That's what it's like being on the other side. So then when you are asked, ""hey buddy, would you like to go back to Earth where you'll inevitably experience suffering and pain?"" **THAT'S NOT AN EASY DECISION TO MAKE!** You must willingly leave the comfort of this beautiful place that you known as home, the place of your greatest comfort and joy, knowing that your experience will be much less satisfying -- and at times, altogether torturous. So to decide ""yes please, I'll have another serving of beatings and unworthiness"" is not an easy decision. There needs to be a powerful reason for a being to decide to come back. (Over my years studying from the New Age teachers, I have come to understand that life is not supposed to feel like pain and suffering. That in fact, we are supposed to feel that joy and satisfaction of being non-physical, but here and now, while we are still in our physical bodies. That experience is available to us, and it is something that we can nurture in this reality, so that we DON'T constantly feel the need to escape and go back ""home""...) **It felt like being back ""Home""** Since my experience, I have found many others online who have had an NDE, and I see this being mentioned over and over. Being on the other side really does feel like being ""home"", you recognize the place instantly because you are so natural and comfortable there. Also, you instantly remember where you are, it doesn't matter how long you have been away (or how harsh your physical experience has been). There is an instant recognition, it's like a programming in your DNA or something. That once you are no longer focused into the physical reality, your focus is free to have full awareness of itself and its true nature (of being a divine infinite expression of consciousness and love). **Where do we go from here?** It has been 16+ years since my NDE now. For the most part, I haven't done anything meaningful with my NDE. I feel like maybe I should share this experience with the world, but the few times that I tried to do that in person, I have been met with backlash or indifference. For example, the person will immediately go on the defensive, ""oh, that was just sleep paralysis and a hallucination, that couldn't have been real."" Or indifference might look like, ""oh, ok crazy person, whatever you say... right, you died and came back, uh-huh... \[the mental hopital is this way :pointing\]"" People act like they care what happens after death, so worried about dying. But the reality seems to be -- they don't want to hear about it from you. **And I don't blame them** Until I had my NDE, I probably wouldn't have believed someone else's recollection either. I don't know if there's any point in sharing my story, you really should have your own NDE. How do you make that happen? I don't know. Seems like your spirit gets to decide the moment. The closest thing I have seen, based on the recollection of other people, is the possibility of reaching this state by consuming Ayahuasca or Magic Mushrooms (both of these have DMT). From what I hear about the experience of those who consumed these compounds, the experience they had of visiting that place of ""pure love"" and meeting with wise guides, is exactly the same as my NDE. Personally, I have only tried cannabis, which for me seems to be very similar to that feeling you get from basking in the shower of pure love while still being lucid (I refer to cannabis as ""the god plant""). The reason that cannabis works is because it allows you to release your memories, and the negative memories are the heavy burden that causes a feeling of separation from Source (so when you drop the memories, it's like being sucked-out of the heavy bodily baggage through that drinking-straw of light). **But, as for knowing about the other side ...** I believe that some people are not meant to know \[just yet\]. There is a benefit to the physical experience, and to wake someone up before they're ready would ruin the experience for them. Because if you think that you are physical and that this life is all you get, you will have a lot more buy-in to this experience, you will take it more seriously. The experience will be a lot more IMMERSIVE. Think of putting on a 3-D headset to play an immersive video game. Now imagine if during that process you completely forgot that you were playing a game. Fighting to survive would feel much more intense, you would really get into it, wouldn't you? So I'm not sure if everyone is supposed to know about the other side. I know that as soon as the truth was shown to me, I could never take this life seriously again. I joke about it, I look forward to dying, I downplay the importance, I've even told others ""stop taking it so seriously, it's just a game."" In a way, that's disrespectful to what is happening here. It's like going into a room full of young children and saying, ""Santa Claus isn't real... the water and air is polluted, that will be your problem to deal with when your parents die, and yes they will die one day... and oh yeah, by the time you're adults, none of the remaining low-paying jobs will be enough to even rent an apartment."" You have to know your audience, and you have to be respectful to the experience they're having. Because you don't know why that person is here, you don't know what their spirit intends for them, or what intention they had coming into this reality. But we didn't all have the same intention. **With that said ...** It's been difficult for me to be back in this physical body. Having the memory of the other side makes it hard, because I am constantly comparing my life and the way I feel here, to how good I could feel in any moment if I just killed myself instead. Physical life is far from perfect, so I am frequently in a feeling place of ""this is not enough, this is not sufficient"", and it feels like I'm suffocating and can't breath. Feeling discomfort and dissatisfaction really effects me. Even if it's just a moment, it feels like an eternity for me. Because deep-down, I know that I am divine, and that I deserve to feel whole, satisfied, and comfortable at all times. It's like -- I feel it's really important that I am respected in that way, and also, like I know that's the way that life should be, and I should never again accept any less than that. **So I don't know what that will look like.** In recent months, I've been driven to find other people who had NDE's, I feel like that might have a clue for me. I've felt very lonely and isolated, but already just knowing there are other likes me, and especially that coming back and being here has been difficult for them too, helps me to know that these feelings I'm having are normal. I posted links in /r/nde to various videos I've come across where I really resonate and recognize the elements of the person sharing their NDE. The elements between our NDE's seem to be the same. I'm glad to have found these videos, because for the longest time after my NDE, I didn't even know there was anyone else like me. Over the past few years, I've shared about my NDE across different threads that have appeared on Reddit. At one point, my story resonated with a lot of people, it was even multi-golded (that was on a different account, I frequently recycle my accounts because of past doxing). I was really moved by how many people benefited from the sharing of my story. I feel like I'm being lead away from software engineering, it's not satisfying enough for me anymore (and frankly, given the fact that infinity is such a long time, I might as well do something that is satisfying). I would like to be a ""Medium"" so that I can help people who have lost a loved one. ""Death"" (which is actually just more life) is a beautiful thing, and I want to help spread this knowing that we do not need to fear death, that it is a positive experience, that our loved ones are experiencing one of the most beautiful gifts this universe has to offer, and help each person reach that place of well-being again after facing a loss, so that they can continue benefiting from this life and experiencing its fullness. For me, being afraid of hell and damnation was a really terrifying experience, to the point that I felt like I was a prisoner. And Source respects us too much to allow us to live with that kind of terror and fear. So I would like to give this gift of knowing of our well-being to everyone else, because I feel that there are a lot of people who are seeking this truth, and I want to be able to help facilitate the sharing of that knowing. **I hope my story has helped you** May your heart be blessed 🧡💎",
723,"The Valley of A Thousand CorpsesI had always been a shy kid growing up. I got teased a lot because of my thin frame and slender appearance. The kids used to call me Sticky Freddy because of this. Even the teacher joined in and would always make jokes from time to time, making me even more less interested in engaging myself with people. There was one kid named Gerard Pouevront who always picked on me and made High School feel like hell on earth. For some unknown reasons, I was his favorite punching bag. The other kids were too afraid of him that they would not dare stand up to him. His father was the richest man in town and their family had a bad reputation of dealing with nuisances their own way. There were rumours circulating at the time that the Pouevronts hired a gang of mafia to guard their house and properties and to deal with their enemies. Everyone in town was scared shitless of them. I remember thinking that one day when I grow up, I am going to leave this shithole of a place and move somewhere else. Then I am going to be super smart and super strong and I am going to return to avenge myself. I am going to make Gerard Pouevront pay for torturing me in High School. But of course, life is not that predictable. I did move out of town after High School and continued on my journey to adulthood with mental scars from my early adolescence. After many years living in the city, I gradually became more confident in my own skin. Soon the name Gerard Pouevront had ceased to evoke fear in me to the point I no longer felt a sudden pang of nausea at the mention or thought of it. I took various jobs to pay for my tuition fees at university and I did very well. When I did return to my town, I was told that Gerard had got killed in a horrible kayaking accident many years ago, only a few weeks after our high school graduation. His parents moved away after the death of their beloved only son. And later I found out that Gerard had enrolled at the same university in the same city I had been living in and had already been accepted. Ironic, isn’t it? If the accident had never happened, he would have continued on his bullying terror and driven me mad. But now come to think of it, I realized something. A delicate thread in this complicated and vulnerable scheme of the universe. A thread of fate whose end had unintentionally latched on to Gerard’s brief lifetime because of me. The accident that had claimed Gerard’s life would have never happened if I had not decided to go fishing before my departure to the city. He had overheard me telling a friend that I was going to spend time with my cousin down at the lake. Of course, he thought it would be a good opportunity to kick the shit out of me for the last time when nobody else was around. But at the last minute I changed my mind about it and decided to spend my last days in town helping my uncle’s at the dairy and earning some more money for my forthcoming journey. Gerard of course, being ignorant and always thirsty for bloodshed, showed up at the lake waiting for me. But I never did. I had never really planned on hurting him physically if I ever returned to this town. The worst would have been me calling him out on his bullying in public, like at a school reunion event or something to humiliate him. But life works in a mysterious way. I still come to visit my parents from time to time but I have never really made any effort whatsoever to reconnect with my high school friends. They are merely a painful reminder of a miserable childhood I don’t wish to revisit. Bullying transcends the boundary of time and space. Indeed, people like Gerard Pouevront are everywhere. I still have to deal with them from time to time in my life. But I am much stronger and smarter now. Though I have to say what I experienced in my early years of adulthood are still affecting me until today. Gerard Pouevront may be long gone, but the same terror that he brought with him wherever he went still persists. For me, it was in the form of a horrible and mean-tempered man who also happened to be my boss at work. I loved doing my job. But his tendency to lose his cool so easily was making it hard for me to do it. I dreaded going to work every morning. I dreaded answering every phone call just in case it was from him. He would call you names and shout at you for simply ‘not being quick enough’ or letting the phone ring twice before answering it. One day I decided I had had enough. I confronted him during a meeting and called him out on his shitty behaviours and walked away. It felt so good. For the first time in my life, instead of running away or letting myself being walked over, I decided to stand up for myself and face my bully. And this was how it all started. After I quit my job, I started to go back to my old hobbies and I even visited my parents a few times before my trips to various places across Europe. Then I impulsively purchased a two-way ticket to this beautiful island in the tropics. As soon as I got there, I started to feel like being born again. Rows and rows of green trees and beautiful beaches with white sand glittering in the sun as far as the eyes can see greeted me everywhere I went. The fresh clean air made me feel so alive and happy. For the first time since I graduated from university, I was genuinely happy again. Genuinely free. I could go anywhere and do anything I wanted. Maybe it had all been what I needed all this time. To escape from life for a while and enjoyed time with myself. The following day after my arrival, I was already soaking up the sun by the pool at this inn where I was staying with a bottle of cold beer in my hand. I befriended two German tourists named Johannes and Nadine on my first day at the inn. I initially thought they were a couple but Nadine told me they were only second cousins though the way they kept touching each other was making me suspicious of it. On my third day, as we lazied around the pool soaking up the sun, Johannes informed me of this strange place deep in the forest the locals considered a sacred place. “There is a secret pool behind the hills. Not too many people know about it. We often go there to meditate and to clear our minds.” “Just the two of you?” I asked. “There would be the three of us, if you decided to join us.” he flashed an enigmatic smile on his thin lips. “Uhm… I don’t know…” I hesitated. “How do we get there?” I tried to sound indifferent though in my head I was actually considering his invitation. “We know the way.” Nadine chimed in. “Yes, it is a sacred place. You have to take all your clothes off before entering it. They normally do not let strangers in there. But… lucky you, you’re with us. So no problem there.” Johannes raised his eyebrows. My thoughts went straight to this beautiful hidden paradise in the middle of the forest where I could see Nadine’s naked body lying down in the grass that made her beautiful tanned skin stand out starkly against the green. “Come join us tomorrow!"" “Err, sorry… what?” I asked, in my head Nadine and I were already wrestling hard in the grass. “It’s called *Lembah Tidur*.” “What is?” “The secret place behind the hills over there. Right beneath the waterfall.” He pointed towards the direction of the gigantic hill formations behind me that looked menacingly tall yet beautiful. “Well it sounds like a really cool place but… “ I paused indecisively for a bit. “I am not sure…” “I’d be happy if you can come, Fred!” said Nadine suddenly. Her voice sounded deep and sweet. And I particularly enjoyed how she pronounced my name rolling the R like that. Also, the fact that she used the word ‘I’ instead of ‘we’ was already making my heart beat faster. If joining them meant that I got to see her naked, then I had no other choice. “I mean I don’t know you guys. Things happen. No offence.” “We’re regulars here. Ask the staff if you don’t believe me.” Johannes shrugged, obviously not wanting to let me go that easy. “I am kidding. Ha ha ha. Oh my god. Yes sure. When are we going?” I burst out laughing. “Then we’ll see you tomorrow. We should get going now. We’ve been swimming all morning.” Johannes stood up and patted me on the shoulder gently. “You’re gonna love it.” Nadine winked and then she surprised me by suddenly giving me a big hug and kissing me on the cheek. Her body smelt of faint green apple. “*Wir sehen uns dann. Schönen Tag…*” she whispered, her lips almost touching the tip of my ear. “*Errr… merci?*” I stammered nervously, prompting them both to burst out laughing simultaneously “Meet us tomorrow morning near the small creek in front of the inn. 6 AM. Don’t be late. You’re not gonna regret it, we promise!” Johannes tapped me gently on my back again and then they both started running back towards the pool and jumped together with a loud splash for the last time. The next morning, as I walked out from the lobby, I saw them both already waiting for me on the other side of the small road. They waved enthusiastically as soon as they saw me. I looked up and saw thick blanket of fog descending from the hilltops above us. The hills looked creepy with weird forms of protrusions poking out randomly to every direction. I stroked my arms hard repeatedly to drive off the cold. Johannes was wearing a thin safari t-shirt that he had left unbuttoned, to show off his muscular chest and abdomen. His surfing pants matched his orange sport shoes making him look like a professional hiker. As soon as I got closer, I could see that Nadine was wearing nothing under her tight maroon t-shirt. Her perky nipples were poking out through the fabric. “*Bonjour*!” I greeted cheerfully, walking closer to join them. Both started giggling. “*Oui, monsieur!*” Johannes played along, still sneering. “What’s that you got in your backpack there? It looks heavy.” “Oh nothing just some stuff. Just in case we get lost and can’t find our way back.” “Great! How was your sleep?” Nadine took my hand and gently stroked it up and down, sending a chill down my spine in excitement. “It was okay. Like a baby. I guess good sleep is good for your mood, isn’t it? Or maybe it’s this place giving off positive vibes all around. I am usually a very grumpy person in the morning.” I said. “Not with me, dear.” said Nadine. “You’re ready?” asked Johannes, eyeing me and Nadine intently before grinning wide. His blue eyes lit up as he looked around us. “Let’s go!” I shouted raising my hands up in the air, making them laugh again with my enthusiasm which I myself had no idea where it had come from. “What’s it called again? Lebby what? The secret place?” We started walking towards the creek in front of us with Johannes leading the way. “*Lembah Tidur*!” Johannes shouted his answer. “It literally means Sleeping Valley in the local language.” My eyes were constantly fixed on Nadine who was walking only a few feet in front of me. We had been walking for almost two hours among rows of tall trees, weaving in and out through heavy vegetations while trying to make our way around the gigantic rocky formation which now looked breathtakingly picturesque under the glimmering sunlight. Then I finally found out why it was called the Sleeping Valley. As soon as the path took a sharp turn northward and met the foot of the hill, I saw dozens of dark rectangular-shaped things poking out from holes on the upper side of the rocky hill. “Are those… “ my voice trailed off as I realized what I was looking at. “Yes, coffins. Hundreds of them.” said Johannes matter-of-factly, as if there weren’t bodies perching high up on the hills above us. Some were even simply left to rest horizontally on uneven rock protrusions on the face of the hill, almost dangling dangerously over the cliff. “This side of the hill is sacred to the locals. They have performed this hanging tombs thing for centuries.” “Hanging tombs?” I asked incredulously. “Yes. According to their belief, burying someone in high places like tops of mountains or tall trees can help the transition of the spirit of the deceased to the other side. Technically speaking, it is to prevent thieves from stealing precious belongings buried with their owner. You know? Like the Ancient Egyptian. It is also a sign of respect to the dead. You see?” Johannes pointed up towards the weathered-looking coffins on the highest rows. “The higher it is, the more respectable the person was when they were still alive. Pretty awesome, huh?” “How do you bury someone in a tree?” I asked again, still amazed and horrified at the same time. “Well not technically a person. Stillborns, mostly. But babies as well. Babies who are no older than a few weeks, who haven’t grown teeth. They dig a hole in the trunk of a huge living tree, put the body inside and cover it with palm fibers. It’s quite beautiful actually, but also poignant. They believe that by burying their babies in the tree, those poor kids would continue to grow with it since they never had the chance to grow old in real life.” “What if the tree falls? What if… what if.. the coffins fall?” I asked, making sure to keep my distance from the hillside. “Yes, it has happened, of course. But they always come back here once or twice a year to make sure it doesn’t happen, you know? They change the coffins, put the bodies in new ones.” My head was filled with horrible ideas that involved hundreds of coffins falling off the cliff at the same time, shaking the ground on impact with a loud cracking sound. “Creepy!” I said. “Not creepy. Weird and uncommon yes. But I personally think it’s cool. They used to only wrap the bodies in a makeshift covering made of dried palm fibers woven together before putting them up there. Imagine what happened days after the decomposition process had already started… it’s a drippin’ nightmare!” Johannes started to laugh, seemingly amused at the sight of my pale face. “Stop it, Jon!” Nadine rolled her eyes at him. I shook my head trying to get rid of those nightmarish thoughts in my head. If a zombie apocalypse was real, zombies falling from the sky would be the last thing you would ever want to encounter. “But then the European missionaries arrived and they started to use wooden coffins.” Johannes continued but I was not listening to him at all. The path took another turn around the hill on its north-side before gently curving towards a small clearing. I started to feel a bit relieved now we could no longer see those coffins. Then we arrived at the edge of a basin which gently sloped down to a grassy path overgrown with trees and bushes. I looked down and saw tree tops as far as up north glimmering in the sun. Right in the middle of the basin in the distance there was a waterfall which poured into a turquoise pond that looked so inviting and enchanting. “Wow! This is amazing!” I blurted out, looking around to take in the beauty that laid before my eyes. The blue sky right ahead only enhanced the greenish golden sheen like a beautiful painting with vivid colours, dreamy yet real at the same time. “Come on!” Johannes started taking his clothes off. Nadine threw a glance at me, a smile on her face, and then followed suit. I could only stare at them nervously, unsure what to do. “You can only enter *Lembah Tidur* naked.” they both urged me, not a single thread of yarn covering their bodies now. “It’s okay….” said Nadine softly, walking towards me. I found myself struggling hard to focus on something else but her naked body. Her platinum hair glistening in the sun. She stroked my cheek gently and landed a kiss on it. I shivered but the cold had got nothing to do with it. They started making their way down to the basin carefully but excitedly, leaving me alone with my own thoughts on the edge. A little hesitant I began undressing slowly and then I followed them down. They had disappeared behind a thick curtain of greens that blanketed the whole valley. I could still hear them chattering and laughing heartily a few feet before me. Then I heard something else as soon as I arrived at the bottom of the basin, the gentle roar of the river flowing hidden among the trees somewhere. “Come on up, Fred!” shouted Johannes. His voice sounded distant and distorted. “We want to show you something!” Then a loud splash that reverberated through the forest, followed by sounds of laughter and excitement. I quickened my pace as I tried to thread my way through the bushes, careful not to catch my skin on the dangerous looking thorns and found them soaking wet sitting under a huge tree whose branches and twigs twisted and coiled down towards the water like snakes. They were staring at me and there was a weird look on their faces. I looked around and saw these red and curious-looking mushrooms poking out of the ground everywhere. “What is this place?” I asked them. My voice sounded different. Distorted by its own echoes that were bouncing around in the air. “*Lembah Tidur*…” answered Nadine in a whisper. She was standing on a rock a few feet before me on the other side of the river now. But her voice sounded so clear as if she was right next to me. She raised her hand and gestured me to come closer. On her head was a wreath of green made in imitation of a crown. Strands of her hair flying into her face as the cold morning breeze blew around her. Then they led me into a rather large clearing among the trees, with the sunlight peeking through the leaves. And I could see decaying bodies scattered about everywhere. Some of them had already been reduced to piles of dried bones, half buried in the ground. The others still looked fresh in the middle of decomposition, bloated and disfigured. Those weird-looking mushrooms grew in clusters around these bodies. Like swarms of maggot. Strangely enough, I did not find myself disgusted by the sight of this symbiotic relationship. They all looked … peaceful? “What is this place?” I asked again when they came closer to hold my trembling hands. “The Sleeping Valley... the resting place of the dead” whispered Nadine, her lips brushing against my ear. “The locals bring their dead here to lay them down in their forever resting place. Those plants accelerate the decomposition process by absorbing fluids from the body and leave only the bones. The process triggers a chemical reaction that produces some kind of gas that cancels out the stench of decay.” Johannes explained. “Nowadays, it is not the locals only who bring their dead here. People from all over the world who are aware of the existence of this place, come to find peace. Those who are terminally sick, and dying of a disease, come here to lie down and these plants help to ease their way to… the other… side…” I started walking around the clearing. I felt a mixture of emotions rising up in my chest. This place looked peaceful yet dangerous. Like a poisonous frog. Only beautiful when viewed from a distance, but deadly upon touch. A wide calm ocean that is hiding a lurking danger beneath its dark surface. “Nature has given us so much… It is time we return the favour…” I looked over my shoulder and saw Johannes and Nadine walking towards me, their naked bodies glistening in the sun. A look of a thousand indescribable desires painted on their faces. Then they led me to one of the bodies and we stood around it for a while. Johannes nodded and Nadine nodded back. Then he bent down and picked up one of those mushrooms that grew out of the body’s rib cage. Upon closer look, I could see the plant was emitting this reddish mist of sweet scent that made my head feel light and relaxed. He gave it to Nadine, who was looking expectant. She pulled its round flat head off the stem and brought it closer to her mouth. Before I realized what was happening, she started eating it with her eyes closed. We watched her for a while in silence. Streaks of red dripping down her nakedness from chin to her breasts. Then she opened her eyes and I could see her dilated pupils opened up even wider to conceal the bright blue. She proceeded to give the mushroom to Johannes, who immediately started to take a huge bite before handing it to me without a word. But I knew what to do. I brought it to my mouth. Now I could see it clearly. There were delicate vein-like structures covering its smooth shiny skin. Like human blood vessels. They were both watching me closer, waiting. Then without a doubt, I put the rest of the mushroom in my mouth and chewed it. As soon as it touched my tongue, I started to feel this wave of ecstasy and coolness that was pulsing throughout my body. I looked around and things were already changing. Colours started to merge and they looked more radiant than before. I could hear the whisper of the wind from up above the top of the hills far away descending down the valley to the basin. I looked ahead and saw myself engaging in intercourse with both Johannes and Nadine. We were one. Our bodies knit together, like a flower to its stalk. Like delicate fabrics braided together to form the first form of life ages ago. I touched the deepest corners of their heart. Their mind. And their humanity. And they to me. I latched hard onto their existence, and theirs to mine. Our tongue was dancing down our throat. Our fingers were prancing between our legs. The lines that divided planes of existence were becoming blurred. We were one. I no longer saw me. I saw us. Our nakedness was sprawled before my eyes on the grass. A smile on our face. We kissed. I kissed. We felt our desires entangled together. And then I felt them moving away from me. I saw them running happily towards the river, leaving me alone. For a moment I was brought back to reality. I opened my eyes and I saw Johannes and Nadine lying on the ground before me with their eyes open. Strands of colours were still billowing at the edge of shapes around me. I looked down and saw the reds merging with the green around them. I could not find where things started and where they ended. I bent down and picked two mushrooms off the skeleton and put them in my mouth with a gulp. And then things started to change again. My senses became one. I tasted the sweet flow of the river. I heard the gentle touch of the grass beneath my feet. I saw the curtain of the wind billowing among the trees. The universe was wide open before me. The veil that draws the line between life and death was drawn. I could see and touch the edge of the sky. Stars were dancing in my hands. Time was flowing like a river around me. And then I heard someone calling my name in the distant. Then again. And again. I looked around but I did not see anyone. “Johannes? Nadine?” I called out. Then I found myself back at my apartment. But I was also up here. And there in *Lembah Tidur*. And then at the pool where I first saw Nadine and became increasingly infatuated with her. Time and space were nothing to me. I moved back and forth at ease. Then before I realized what was happening, I felt a very strong force pulling me back to the ground. I opened my eyes and found myself lying in the grass, a beautiful face hovering above me. She was sitting right next to me, placing her hands on my chest and on my head that was still spinning. “You okay?” she asked softly. She was naked as well I realized. There was a thin silver mesh necklace around her long neck, with a little flower-shaped turquoise stone dangling from it. “I… I am okay. Just a bit light-headed.” I answered honestly. “You fainted there for a moment. You shouldn’t have eaten it like that. Just a small bite should do. You’re lucky you’re still alive.” she warned me. “You could have died.” I squeezed my thigh and tried to get up in a sitting position. My whole body was trembling like crazy. And then a very beautiful smile curved on her lips. “What time is it?” I asked, stroking my head as if trying to shake off the effect of the mushrooms. “6 am.” “That’s impossible!” “What?” I glanced at my watch and was surprised to see that it was indeed 6 AM. But how? “We started our journey then exactly at around 6 am. It must have taken us 3 or 4 hours to get here. So why is it still 6 am? Unless time has stopped all of a sudden.” She rolled her eyes. “What day do you think it is now?” she raised one of her eyebrows suspiciously. “Errr…. “ I tried to think. “Wednesday?” She burst out laughing while tossing her dark red hair back and exhaled. “Then you’ve been unconscious for two days. Because today is Friday.” “What? That can’t be true!” I protested. “Is this a joke? Are you pranking me or something?” “You’re not the only one who has ever been under the influence of these things. The effect is really strong yeah. It can change your perception of time.” As we were making our way back to the inn (fully clothed), she told me her name was Lisa and that she had visited *Lembah Tidur* a few times with her friends before and I was the first tourist that she had ever encountered there. She said she had seen me trashing around on the ground as if suffocating and decided to help. And that’s when I had woken up to see her. I was still feeling rather light-headed when we finally arrived at the inn. She offered to make me a cup of strong tea and asked me to lie down on the couch in the lobby. “I’ve never been that high in my entire life before!” I admitted to her, stroking my face that still felt numb and cold. Suddenly it dawned on me that she had found me trashing around like a mad man naked in the wilderness and that made me feel so embarrassed. “You should be careful there. Don’t eat too much of it. It’s dangerous. If I hadn’t woken you up you would have probably been trapped in your own head under the influence of that plant forever.” she said, handing me the cup of tea. “F-fforever?” I stammered, feeling a chill down my spine. “Well at least not in a literal sense. Like I said before, it alters how you perceive time. In your own mind, time will stretch and expand wider and wider, years and even ages will pass. When in reality only a few days have passed.” I gulped, imagining my body lying down in the middle of that place for 2 days. No wonder I felt so tired and sick. “When I was under the influence of that thing, I saw… things…” “Of course.” “It was like in a dream, but it also felt so real. Everything was so beautiful and perfect.” “Oh don’t hang on to that!” “What do you mean?” “Those people there… those bodies… they are not entirely dead, you know?” I was already sipping down my tea and paused when I heard her saying that. “Not entirely dead? What’s that supposed to mean?” “Their consciousness is still there. They’re still trapped in there. Physically they may have been long dead, their bodies reduced to only bones and ashes. But their minds are still intact. They are living a fantasy, unaware of their surroundings. That plant is preserving their self-awareness in the form of illusion that will go on and on forever. They may look dead to us, what with their decaying bodies. But their self-awareness goes on in another plane of existence beyond this life.” I shook my head, taking in the horror of what she had just told me. It was a close call for me. I almost got trapped in my own mind for good. A form of existence I did not want to be in. “But that’s…” “Impossible yes I know.” she guessed my skepticism. “But how did you know all this?” “My father… he is one of those bodies you saw there.” “Oh, I am sorry.” “It’s okay. He was one of the few people like you who had seen what it was like on the other side and figured out how it worked. And he decided to return to reality only to say goodbye to me. After my mother passed away, he felt that he had nothing else to hold on to. And to top things off, he said…. He said he had heard her calling his name when he was lying down unconscious on the ground under the plant’s influence the first time. He was sure he would see her again. And there was nothing I could do to stop him. But if it was the only way for him to be truly happy again. Then I had no choice. It was already killing me slowly seeing him shutting his life off like that after my mother’s death.” she said, glistening streaks of tears rolling down her cheeks. “I am so sorry…” “Thanks. I still come here to visit him from time to time.” “Do those tourists know about it?” I asked again. “Some do. Some don’t.” “Those who know, why do they go there anyway?” “They want to end their own lives. What else? They are disappointed. Bored. Depressed. And leaving this plane of existence to depart to another sounds like a chance of a lifetime.” I remembered what Johannes had told me earlier. Those poor people came to *Lembah Tidur* with the knowledge that those plants will ease their transition to the other side. I had caught a glimpse of what it was there, on that other plane of existence. Though I have to admit it was an amazing place, I still don't want to end like that. Forever trapped in my own head. In a distorted version of reality. My whole body started to shake when I thought about what might have happened if Lisa had not found me. It was true that at one point in my life, I had been bored and depressed, to the point where I had felt almost suicidal. But to live in a pale imitation of life like that? No fucking way. “Lisa…” I took her hand and hold it tight. “Thank You for saving me.” she smiled and nodded her head, strands of her red wavy hair falling into her face. I still had a few days on that island but I decided to return home earlier than I had planned. As soon as my plane landed, I decided to visit my parents, which was something I had not done in months. My mother looked really surprised when she opened the door only to see me standing there watery-eyed. If there was something positive I got from my experience in *Lembah Tidur*, it would be the fact that deep in my heart, I knew that I wanted to live. I loved my family. Loneliness is a deadly disease that is slowly eating away at the soul and the mind and forcing us into exile estranged from the people who genuinely love and care about us. A few weeks later I found another job offered by a friend of mine and with a new perspective in my life, I started to hold on to only positive thoughts. I no longer considered my job and routines as something boring or time-consuming. I did everything with a different approach and point of view. I realized we can never have everything in life. But we can make our own happiness by being thankful for every little good thing that makes us smile and feel that we have a purpose. I still kept in touch with Lisa. We would talk on the phone for hours and the closer we become, the deeper I found myself falling in love with her. The way she was always trying hard to be positive without complaining about every thing that did not work out well for her made me fall head over heels in love with her. All my life, I had never met someone who really loved life more than anything else. She opened my eyes and made me realize it was all just how I saw things. That every cloud has a silver lining. I was lost for a moment. And then I met her. And in her, I found the reason I loved life. We were having a long distant kind of thing for two years and I would visit her in her hometown several times a year. And likewise. Then one day, I found the courage to ask her to marry me. She said yes. A happy surprise came by the end of the summer that year. Lisa had a job offer in the city I was living in and she decided to accept it so we could finally move in together. We got married in December. My parents were there, so were her brother, cousins, and two aunts. Our lives were complete. I really enjoyed my new role as a husband. My mother was right. A family was the answer to my loneliness and depression. And then William, our first child was born. We loved being parents more than anything else. By the time William was finally able to walk, Lisa gave birth to our second son, Nelson. But of course, life is not always rainbow and sunshine. Only a few days after our 20th wedding anniversary, my father passed away from a heart attack. I was crushed. I loved my father so much. He was my hero. My best friend. I fell back into depression and started to use drugs and drink alcohol. Lisa had always been there for me. But there was nothing she could do to ease the pain. Every night, I would come home drunk, crying, shouting, feeling angry and bitter. Lisa tried her best to help me, but I was too deep in my grief that I began ignoring her. Our marriage fell apart. She filed for divorce a week after the 2nd anniversary of my father’s death. I did not say anything. I just nodded my head and walked away. I was lost again and this time she could not save me. I had given up. Now I had nothing to be happy for. And in the middle of my own destruction, this voice… that had been pretending to be lost for years, nagging me in my dreams, started to emerge. It wanted me to be happy again. Yet in my situation, there was only one way to do that. I had to go back to *Lembah Tidur*. I flew back there the following day after our divorce was finalized. I did not tell anybody where I was going. Not even my mother and my kids. They did not deserve to miss a loser like me. It only took me a few hours to find it. And it still looked exactly as I remembered it. Beautiful and serene. Peaceful. The surface of the river was glistening in the sun. The leaves were fluttering in the wind as I walked down the slope into the mystic world, naked and hopeful, unseen to the rest of the world. As if they had all been waiting for this day. A soft bell-like sound was heard in the air. This is it, I thought. I am here. It was calling me. I walked to one of the bodies on the river bank. It was a woman. It looked like only a few hours had passed since it was laid down to rest. Her naked pale skin had already started to turn bluish. Her upper torso was partially submerged in the water. Her long dark hair, gilded with the redness of the afternoon sky, was billowing out around her like silk. She was beautiful. Like a sleeping water nymph. I walked to another corpse half-hidden in the bushes. It was a skeleton of another woman, lying peacefully both arms clasped together like praying, with those mushrooms poking out of her rib cage and barely there stomach. As soon as I got closer, I realized that I recognized her long straight platinum hair even though it had bits of dirt and grass clung to it, Her pretty face was long gone. Her body was almost completely reduced to bones. But there was no doubt. It was her. I reached down to touch her disfigured face. Is she still in there somewhere? Far beyond this plane of existence. How many lifetimes has she spent while her body was lying here rotting away? Maybe I was about to find out. I picked one mushroom off her rib, closed my eyes and without hesitation I took a huge bite and started to chew it. It tasted weird, I realized. I had not had time to remember how it tasted like the first time since the effect was already kicking in the second it touched my lips. But this time, it was different. I was aware of how it tasted like a mixture of different fruits that left a very strong tangy aftertaste. I inhaled deeply and waited. Nothing happened. I waited again. 30 seconds had passed and I could still feel my body. I opened my eyes and saw nothing had changed. I took another bite and waited. Still nothing. I swallowed the whole thing in frustration and waited. Nothing. I sighed and picked some of the biggest mushrooms poking out of the body and started to eat them all greedily. And then I felt a sharp throbbing pain piercing through my chest as my breath seized up. And I lost control of my body. The pain was too much. I fell backwards and landed hard on my back, trying to catch breath. The last thing I saw as I writhed in agony on the ground was the dark canopy above me. I thought of Lisa and my kids and my mother. How much I loved them. I thought of my father. How much I missed him. I should have never come here the first time. I should have never come here now. &#x200B; \*\*\* &#x200B; I opened my eyes and immediately regretted it. The blazing sun overhead was hurting my eyes, burning my naked skin. I was sweating all over. My body was shaking hard. A face appeared above me, blocking the sun. Her platinum hair glistening in the sun. Her face looking pale. “Fred?” she gasped. “Oh God. You scared me for a moment I thought you’re dead. You weren’t breathing at all.” “Where am I?” I tried to get up but a splitting pain at the base of my skull made me recoil and before I could lay down a wave of nausea washed over me. I turned onto my side and threw up. “Get it all out of your system. Good!” Nadine patted me gently on my back. “Jesus, Fred. How many did you have? That’s stupid. You could have died.” “I don’t kn –“ I threw up again. “Come on let’s get somewhere cooler. You can walk?” I forced my body to stand up and followed her under a huge tree whose branches were touching the water next to me. “Where’s Johannes?” I asked her as I bent down to wash my face and body. My pale and sick-looking reflection stared back at me. “He’s going back to the inn to find some help. What the fuck were you thinking. A single bite is enough to get you high. And you had how many? Twenty?” she reproached, frowning at me. The deafening silence that had hung in the air earlier was gone. I could hear the roaring waterfall in the distance. “I saw something.” “What?” “What time is it?” I looked up at the canopy above us as a cool breeze started to blow in our direction. The sun was peeking through the trees, casting fluttering shadows around us. “I think it’s already midday.” she answered. Those mushrooms had messed with my head and affect my perception of time. In reality, only a few hours had passed since we had come. But under its influence, I had spent a huge portion of a lifetime in which I experienced the ups and downs of life, in which I fell in love and grieved over my personal losses in life. It had poisoned my mind and soul and tricked me into living a life that had never been there. Lisa… my kids… they had never been real. Just fragments of my hallucination. Now that I was back in the real word, it all just seemed like a dream, or a distant memory almost forgotten. For a few seconds after I had come to, I had felt a sense of longing for them. I had been frantically reaching out to hold on to my memories of them. “You said you saw something? What was it?” asked Nadine. I told her what I had seen and experienced and she looked at me with a rather disheartened and shocked look on her face. “Oh Fred. I am so sorry to hear that. I know it’s not real. But still, to live a long life only to have it erased just like that in a blink of an eye is horrible even though it only happened in your head.” she sympathized. “I would have been depressed.” “Yeah because… you know… I kind of… miss them…” She nodded and put her hands on her cheeks, looking miserable. “Now I can’t even remember how they looked like. It’s fading away. Funny I know. Missing people I have never even met.” She got on her knees and put her arms around me. We hugged there for what felt like minutes. Our naked skins touched. I could feel her heartbeat. “Let’s get out of here before sunset or we will have troubles finding our way back.” she stood up wiping her eyes. “Yes. You’re right.” We got on our feet and started walking along the river bank when something shiny on the ground caught my attention. I paused and walked closer and then I saw it. A skeleton half buried in the sand. Around its bony neck was a silver mesh bracelet, with a flower-shaped blue stone latched to it.",

Oberyn was ever the viper. Deadly, dangerous, unpredictable. No man dared tread on him. I was the grass. Pleasant, complaisant, sweet-smelling, swaying with every breeze. Who fears to walk upon the grass? But it is the grass that hides the viper from his enemies and shelters him until he strikes. Your father and I worked more closely than you know … but now he is gone. The question is, can I trust his daughters to serve me in his place?"" A Dance with Dragons – The Watcher **Introduction** Names like Ser Aerys Oakheart, Princess Arianne Martell, and Ser Balon Swann are foreign to show only watchers but exhibit the lack of effort given to the true Dornish plot of A Song of Ice and Fire. The lowest rated episode by viewers in the television series ‘Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken’ is titled with the words of House Martell. The Sandsnakes and Dornish were received as shallow and uninspired characters with no relevance. Their true natures and actions are massively underrated and will play a role in The Winds of Winter. I invite you to drop those prior thoughts and dive into the Deeper Dorne and a reeducation of the infamous older four of the eight daughters of Prince Oberyn Martell the Red Viper of Dorne and how they will play their part in events so come. The ruling family of Dorne consist of Prince Doran Martell, his royal consort Mellario of Norvos and their three children, heir Princess Arianne, Prince Quentyn, and Prince Trystane. The Sandsnakes are the 8 daughters of his brother Prince Oberyn who function as supporting characters in the Dornish plot, working under their father, uncle, and cousins to promote Dornish interest unlike the show where they called the shots. Our primary POVs into them are the Captain of Guards in Sunspear, Areo Hotah and a close companion of the Sandsnakes, their cousin Princess Arianne. >Hotah studied each of them in turn. Obara, rusted nails and boiled leather, with her angry, close-set eyes and rat-brown hair. Nymeria, languid, elegant, olive-skinned, her long black braid bound up in red-gold wire.

He knew her stride; long-legged, hasty, angry. In the stables by the gates, her horse would be lathered, and bloody from her spurs. She always rode stallions and had been heard to boast that she could master any horse in Dorne . . . and any man as well. Obara was the eldest Sand Snake, a big-boned woman near to thirty, with the close-set eyes and rat-brown hair of the Oldtown whore who'd birthed her. Obara Sand always walked too fast. She is chasing after something she can never catch, the prince had told his daughter once, in the captain's hearing. Beneath a mottled sandsilk cloak of dun and gold, her riding clothes were old brown leather, worn and supple. They were the softest things about her. On one hip she wore a coiled whip, across her back a round shield of steel and copper. She had left her spear outside. A Feast for Crowns - Captain of the Guards Boisterous and perpetually angry Obara chose the spear over tears at an early age. She is usually the first to act out of her siblings and often does so without much thought beforehand. Obara holds a deep seeded hate for Oldtown, the birthplace of her disgraced mother. Seeking the approval of her father Obara shows true loyalty to only he and her sisters and lacks respect for many others regardless of social rank. **Nymeria Sand** >Nymeria Sand was five-and-twenty, and slender as a willow. Her straight black hair, worn in a long braid bound up with red-gold wire, made a widow's peak above her dark eyes, just as her father's had. With her high cheekbones, full lips, and milk-pale skin, she had all the beauty that her elder sister lacked . . . but Obara's mother had been an Oldtown whore, whilst Nym was born from the noblest blood of old Volantis. A dozen mounted spearmen tailed her, their round shields gleaming in the sun. They followed her down the dune. A Feast for Crows – Captain of the Guards >She wore a gown of yellow silk so sheer and fine that the candles shone right through it to reveal the spun gold and jewels beneath. So immodest was her garb that the white knight seemed uncomfortable looking at her, but Hotah approved. Nymeria was least dangerous when nearly naked. Elsewise she was sure to have a dozen blades concealed about her person. A Dance with Dragons- The Watcher A princess is all but name, Lady Nym is the second eldest and most beautiful of the Sandsnakes. She is known to carry similar lust as her father, enjoying the company women sometimes two at a time. Inheriting Oberyn’s martials prowess as well, she wields blades all over her person. Calculating and regal, Nymeria commands the most respect of her siblings and is often the mouthpiece for the group. She has a close relationship with House Fowler who controls The Prince’s Pass, one of the two land passes into Dorne from the north. **Tyene Sand** >She was sitting cross-legged on a pillow beneath the raised dais where the high seats stood, but she rose as they entered, dressed in a clinging gown of pale blue samite with sleeves of Myrish lace that made her look as innocent as the Maid herself. In one hand was a piece of embroidery she had been working on, in the other a pair of golden needles. Her hair was gold as well, and her eyes were deep blue pools . . . and yet somehow they reminded the captain of her father's eyes, though Oberyn's had been as black as night. All of Prince Oberyn's daughters have his viper eyes, Hotah realized suddenly. The color does not matter. Lady Tyene's voice was gentle, and she looked as sweet as summer strawberries. Her mother had been a septa, and Tyene had an air of almost otherworldly innocence about her. A Feast for Crows – Captain of the Guards >”Sisters, truly, I know the poison Father used. If his spear so much as broke the Mountain's skin, Clegane is dead, I do not care how big he was. Doubt your little sister if you like, but never doubt our sire."" Lady Tyene smiled at that. Her soft, pale hands were as deadly as Obara's callused ones, if not more so. He watched her carefully, alert to every little flutter of her fingers. A Dance with Dragons – The Watcher Pious, proper, and poisonous Tyene Sand is the slyest of her sisters. Growing up as best friends with her cousin Princess Arianne, they know better than any the dangerous extent of one another’s allure. They two ladies learned to read together and shared their first man and drink. She always seems to have more information that what she lets on and shares Oberyn’s mastery of poisons and her mother’s education as a septa from The Reach. Tyene maintains an innocent composure but remains as vengeful as her siblings. **Sarella Sand** >My uncle brought me here, with Tyene and Sarella."" The memory made Arianne smile. ""He caught some vipers and showed Tyene the safest way to milk them for their venom. Sarella turned over rocks, brushed sand off the mosaics, and wanted to know everything there was to know about the people who had lived here."" A Feast for Crows – The Queenmaker >The prince considered. ""Ellaria's girls are too young to be a danger, but there are those who might seek to use them against me. It would be best to keep them safe in hand. Yes, the little ones as well . . . but first secure Tyene, Nymeria, and Obara."" ""As my prince commands."" His heart was troubled. My little princess will mislike this. ""What of Sarella? She is a woman grown, almost twenty."" ""Unless she returns to Dorne, there's naught I can do about Sarella save pray that she shows more sense than her sisters. Leave her to her . . . game. Gather up the others. I shall not sleep until I know that they are safe and under guard."" A Feast for Crows – Captain of the Guards >How could you tell I was of noble birth?"" ""The same way you can tell that I'm half Dornish."" The statement was delivered with a smile, in a soft Dornish drawl. A Feast for Crowns – Prologue Many speculate that that acolyte training alongside Samwell Tarly, “Lazy Leo” Tyrell, and Pate the Pigboy is Sarella under a male disguise (ALLERAS backwards). Alleras admits to a half Dornish, half Summer Islander heritage, the same as Sarella Sand. Alleras has great skill in archery as Summer Islanders are renowned for. Alleras has also made a quick friendship with Marwyn the Mage, an archmaster known to possess a Glass Candle and dabble in Dark Magic. Interesting enough, Sarella leaves Dorne during the events of either A Game of Thrones or A Storm of Swords meaning both Oberyn and Doran are aware of the plot and the Dornish have truly been working for some time to influence events in the story. **The Four Pillar Theory** >Some of the tension went out of the prince. Hotah saw him sag back into his chair. He held out his hand, and Princess Arianne moved to his side to hold it. ""Tell them, Father."" Prince Doran took a jagged breath. ""Dorne still has friends at court. Friends who tell us things we were not meant to know. This invitation Cersei sent us is a ruse. Trystane is never meant to reach King's Landing. On the road back, somewhere in the kingswood, Ser Balon's party will be attacked by outlaws, and my son will die. I am asked to court only so that I may witness this attack with my own eyes and thereby absolve the queen of any blame. Oh, and these outlaws? They will be shouting, 'Halfman, Halfman,' as they attack. Ser Balon may even catch a quick glimpse of the Imp, though no one else will."" Areo Hotah would not have believed it possible to shock the Sand Snakes. He would have been wrong. A Dance with Dragons – The Watcher The four pillars of Westeros society are the **Crown**, **Military**, the **Faith**, and the **Citadel**. The Iron Throne controls laws and economy, the military and lieges defend it, the Faith inspires the morality of the realm, and the maesters control information, education, and scientific progress. Prince Doran is aware of the unpredictable nature of his nieces and decides to place each of them in positions to learn these systems from the inside out and spread Dornish influence in each while seeking revenge for the death of their father. All the while Doran is playing every side in the current wars that surround his country. Prince Trystane has been betrothed to Princess Myrcella Baratheon, Princess Arianne has been sent to Storm’s End to meet with the suspected son of her late aunt Elia, (f)Aegon Targaryen, and Prince Quentyn has been dispatched to Meereen to seek a marriage pact to Queen Daenerys Targaryen. Currently Dorne has a hand in nearly every cookie jar of southern politics in Westeros and many of Doran’s overcooked plans will start to bear fruit very soon via his children and overzealous nieces. **The Crown – Lady Nym** >The time is not yet come for Dorne to openly defy the Iron Throne, so we must need return Myrcella to her mother, but I will not be accompanying her. That task will be yours, Nymeria. The Lannisters will not like it, no more than they liked it when I sent them Oberyn, but they dare not refuse. We need a voice in council, an ear at court. Be careful, though. King's Landing is a pit of snakes."" Lady Nym smiled. ""Why, Uncle, I love snakes."" A Dance with Dragons – The Watcher The fued between the Reach and Dorne goes back thousands of years from invasions, assassinations, and growing disdain between the two regions igniting with recent events. Although Willas Tyrell found forgiveness for the jousting incident that left him crippled Mace Tyrell has not let it go that Oberyn Martell injured his heir decades prior to the start of the story. Going so far as to having a full fledge meltdown in A Storm of Swords when it’s announced that the Dornish would be attending Margaery’s wedding and now have their own seat on the Small Council. Mace will have a jarring reaction to the bastard daughter of Oberyn taking over the seat on the now Reachmen heavy council. More so because before Kevan Lannister can inform the council members of her arrival he is murdered by Varys so he is currently unaware that she is even coming. >The seventh voice would be the Dornishwoman now escorting Myrcella home. The Lady Nym. But no lady, if even half of what Qyburn reports is true. A bastard daughter of the Red Viper, near as notorious as her father and intent on claiming the council seat that Prince Oberyn himself had occupied so briefly. Ser Kevan had not yet seen fit to inform Mace Tyrell of her coming. The Hand, he knew, would not be pleased. The man we need is Littlefinger. Petyr Baelish had a gift for conjuring dragons from the air. A Dance with Dragons – Epilogue However, Lady Nym does not easily forget either and although her father’s paramour Ellaria Sand gives a heartfelt testimonial that peace is what the Sandsnakes should seek to break the wheel of constant violence and vengeance Nymeria is hearing none of it. >Ellaria’s cheeks were wet with tears, her dark eyes shining. Even weeping, she has a strength in her, the captain thought. “Oberyn wanted vengeance for Elia. Now the three of you want vengeance for him. I have four daughters, I remind you. Your sisters. My Elia is fourteen, almost a woman. Obella is twelve, on the brink of maiden-hood. They worship you, as Dorea and Loreza worship them. If you should die, must El and Obella seek vengeance for you, then Dorea and Loree for them? Is that how it goes, round and round forever? I ask again, where does it end?” Ellaria Sand laid her hand on the Mountain’s head. “I saw your father die. Here is his killer. Can I take a skull to bed with me, to give me comfort in the night? Will it make me laugh, write me songs, care for me when I am old and sick?” “What would you have us do, my lady?” asked the Lady Nym. “Shall we lay down our spears and smile, and forget all the wrongs that have been done to us? When she had gone, Lady Nym said, “I know she loved our father well, but it is plain she never understood him.” A Dance with Dragons - The Watcher Cersei has recently found a taste for exotic women in Taena Merryweather. Later, following Cersei’s arrest Taena runs back to her husband’s seat of Longtable and the Queen may be open to having some new allies around her and a reunion with Myrcella could immediately put Lady Nym in her good graces. Luckily Nymeria likes the ladies too. In addition, a meeting between Nymeria Sand and Ser Robert strong is inevitable and would expose the lie that the skull sent to Dorne was not Ser Gregor Clegane's if it's revealed they are one in the same. **The Military – Obara** >Prince Doran raised a hand. His knuckles were as dark as cherries and near as big. ""Ser Balon is a guest beneath my roof. He has eaten of my bread and salt. I will not do him harm. No. We will travel to the Water Gardens, where he will hear Myrcella's story and send a raven to his queen. The girl will ask him to hunt down the man who hurt her. If he is the man I judge, Swann will not be able to refuse. Obara, you will lead him to High Hermitage to beard Darkstar in his den. A Dance with Dragons – The Watcher Obara will serve as Prince Doran’s muscle carrying out his secret martial pursuits. She wouldn’t last in Kingslanding with such an aggressive and uncouth demeanor and must also be sent away from Sunspear because of her current bloodthirst in response to Oberyn’s murder. Starfall, the seat of House Dayne is the location of various mysteries and developing plots within the story. Namely the mysterious suicide of Ashara Dayne after her alleged lover Ned Stark returns the famed sword Dawn following the Battle at The Tower of Joy, Ashara’s alleged stillbirth and rumors of mothering Jon Snow, locating the lost young lord Edric who is nicknamed “Ned”, the possibility of another Sword of the Morning from the current generation emerging, and the truth about the assault on Princess Myrcella. Ser Gerald “Darkstar” Dayne is the lord of High Hermitage, a cadet branch of House Dayne further up the Red Mountains. He is the alleged perpetrator in the maiming of Princess Myrcella but Obara, Nymeria, and Tyene all agree that it wasn’t him but if so, who was it? Balon Swann, Areo Hotah, and Obara could be walking into an ambush or be forced to change perspectives once he pleads his case. Either way something smells fishy. Areo Hotah has imagined that a time will come when he’d cross swords with Arys Oakheart, Balon Swann, and Obara Sand and the possible outcomes of each and yet the three are tasked with working together now. So far 1/3 have already come true. If they all come to pass, can Areo find victory each time and what side will Obara pick. >The white knight. The captain frowned. Ser Arys had come to Dorne to attend his own princess, as Areo Hotah had once come with his. Even their names sounded oddly alike: Areo and Arys. Yet there the likeness ended. The captain had left Norvos and its bearded priests, but Ser Arys Oakheart still served the Iron Throne. Hotah had felt a certain sadness whenever he saw the man in the long snowy cloak, the times the prince had sent him down to Sunspear. One day, he sensed, the two of them would fight; on that day Oakheart would die, with the captain’s longaxe crashing through his skull. A Feast for Crows - Captain of the Guards >When she appeared beneath the triple arch, Areo Hotah swung his longaxe sideways to block the way. The head was on a shaft of mountain ash six feet long, so she could not go around. “My lady, no farther.” His voice was a bass grumble thick with the accents of Norvos. “The prince does not wish to be disturbed.” She had left her spear outside. For that, Areo Hotah gave thanks. Quick and strong as she was, the woman was no match for him, he knew... but she did not, and he had no wish to see her blood upon the pale pink marble. A Feast for Crows-The Captain of the Guards >Ser Balon Swann was taut as a drawn bow, the captain of guards observed. This new white knight was not so tall nor comely as the old one, but he was bigger across the chest, burlier, his arms thick with muscle. His snowy cloak was clasped at the throat by two swans on a silver brooch. One was ivory, the other onyx, and it seemed to Areo Hotah as if the two of them were fighting. The man who wore them looked a fighter too. This one will not die so easy as the other. He will not charge into my axe the way Ser Arys did. He will stand behind his shield and make me come at him. If it came to that, Hotah would be ready. His longaxe was sharp enough to shave with. A Dance with Dragons - The Watcher **The Faith – Tyene** >”Your mother was a septa. Oberyn once told me that she read to you in the cradle from the Seven-Pointed Star. I want you in King's Landing too, but on the other hill. The Swords and the Stars have been re-formed, and this new High Septon is not the puppet that the others were. Try and get close to him."" ""Why not? White suits my coloring. I look so … pure."" A Dance with Dragons – The Watcher As stated by her older sister Lady Nym and Tyene herself, she is the key to getting into the Red Keep and doing damage that no one would see coming. The Sandsnakes have their assassination victims already listed Tywin, Cersei, Jaime, and Tommen. Two targets are present in the capital. Tyene looks young, innocent, and under the guise of religion can get a place at court amongst the growing fanatics who are struggling with nobles for power in the capital. >Nym glanced over a shoulder, to where her companions rode a dozen lengths behind. “I was abed with the Fowler twins when the word reached me,” the captain heard her say. “You know the Fowler words? Let Me Soar! That is all I ask of you. Let me soar, Uncle. I need no mighty host, only one sweet sister.” “Obara?” “Tyene. Obara is too loud. Tyene is so sweet and gentle that no man will suspect her. Obara would make Oldtown our father’s funeral pyre, but I am not so greedy. Four lives will suffice for me. Lord Tywin’s golden twins, as payment for Elia’s children. The old lion, for Elia herself. And last of all the little king, for my father.” A Feast for Crows-Captain if the Guards Queen Regent Cersei Lannister attempts to forgo a portion of the crown’s depts by foolishly decreeing the resurgence of the Faith Militant under the direction of the corrupt new High Septon, deemed the High Sparrow. This results in her arrest and public humiliation on a confession of accused charges. Following her walk of atonement Cersei is now under 24/7 supervision by the High Sparrow’s female novices and septas who have access to her bed, food, drink, and whereabouts throughout the Red Keep. A dangerous position to put a poisons expert in. >The meal was served by three novices, well-scrubbed girls of good birth between the ages of twelve and sixteen. In their soft white woolens, each seemed more innocent and unworldly than the last, yet the High Septon had insisted that no girl spend more than seven days in the queen’s service, lest Cersei corrupt her. They tended the queen’s wardrobe, drew her bath, poured her wine, changed her bedclothes of a morning. One shared the queen’s bed every night, to ascertain she had no other company; the other two slept in an adjoining chamber with the septa who looked over them. A Dance with Dragons – Epilogue **The Citadel – The Sphinx** >Tell them how wise and good they are. Tell them that Aemon commanded you to put yourself into their hands. Tell them that you have always dreamed that one day you might be allowed to wear the chain and serve the greater good, that service is the highest honor, and obedience the highest virtue. But say nothing of prophecies or dragons, unless you fancy poison in your porridge."" Marwyn snatched a stained leather cloak off a peg near the door and tied it tight. ""Sphinx, look after this one."" ""I will,"" Alleras answered, but the archmaester was already gone. They heard his boots stomping down the steps. ""I have a confession. Ours was no chance encounter, Sam. The Mage sent me to snatch you up before you spoke to Theobald. He knew that you were coming."" ""How?"" Alleras nodded at the glass candle. Sam stared at the strange pale flame for a moment, then looked away. Outside the window it was growing dark. A Feast for Crows- Samwell V The wildcard. If Alleras the acolyte at the Citadel is indeed Sarella Sand, Doran Martell has a wide scope of information available to him. Alleras is trusted with Samwell Tarly and a glass candle. Complicating things further, a distance cousin of House Tyrell “Lazy Leo” also is aware of the glass candle and could possibly use it. Though it hasn’t been used by a POV character yet glass candles are said to cause visions and allow the user to see over vast distances. An incredibly useful tool supported by the abundance of information available at the Citadel. With the Ironborn invading the Reach and Faceless Men now present in Oldtown the ancient Valyrian artifact and Alleras may be invaluable assets in coming events. Jon, Daenerys, Jaime, Aemon and other characters have experienced dreams and visions that heavily hint at the use of various Glass Candles being in use throughout the world. Maesters do not like magic and Alleras like Sarella is said to often put themselves in the middle of situations that they should probably leave alone due to curiosity. One of the only characters to also mention the three headed dragon prophesy and nicknamed “The Sphinx”, Alleras will be a game changer. >When Marwyn had returned to Oldtown, after spending eight years in the east mapping distant lands, searching for lost books, and studying with warlocks and shadowbinders, Vinegar Vaellyn had dubbed him “Marwyn the Mage.” The name was soon all over Oldtown, to Vaellyn’s vast annoyance. “Leave spells and prayers to priests and septons and bend your wits to learning truths a man can trust in,” Archmaester Ryam had once counseled Pate, but Ryam’s ring and rod and mask were yellow gold, and his maester’s chain had no link of Valyrian steel. Armen looked down his nose at Lazy Leo. He had the perfect nose for it, long and thin and pointed. “Archmaester Marwyn believes in many curious things,” he said, “but he has no more proof of dragons than Mollander. Just more sailors’ stories.” “You’re wrong,” said Leo. “There is a glass candle burning in the Mage’s chambers.” A hush fell over the torchlit terrace. Armen sighed and shook his head. Mollander began to laugh. The Sphinx studied Leo with his big black eyes. A Feast for Crown – Prologue >That had been one of his last good days. After that the [Maester Aemon] old man spent more time sleeping than awake, curled up beneath a pile of furs in the captain's cabin. Sometimes he would mutter in his sleep. When he woke he'd call for Sam, insisting that he had to tell him something, but oft as not he would have forgotten what he meant to say by the time that Sam arrived. Even when he did recall, his talk was all a jumble. He spoke of dreams and never named the dreamer, of a glass candle that could not be lit and eggs that would not hatch. He said the sphinx was the riddle, not the riddler, whatever that meant. A Feast for Crows - Samwell IV **TL;DR The older Sandsnakes will be extremely influential characters in the coming events in The Winds of Winter but not nearly in the way that their HBO counterparts were. They will infiltrate the four pillars of Westeros society the Crown (Nymeria), Military (Obara), the Faith (Tyene), &amp;amp;amp; Citidel (Sarella) on the order of Prince Doran. Planning to enact revenge for the deaths of Princess Elia and Prince Oberyn and the attempt on Prince Trystane’s life. They will send knowledge back to Prince Doran of events surrounding them while furthering Dornish interest from behind the scenes.**",
725,"I've stolen memories from hundreds of people.Within a minute, the memory had been wiped from his troubled mind. It hardly took any effort from my side, but the results were immediate. I could visibly see the look of ease wash over his pained face, as the heavy weight of remembering was taken off his shoulders. I, on the other hand, felt shivers surge down my spine as the events unfolded in the back of my mind. The memory of his childhood abuse, the broken bones and bruises, an image forming in my mind's eye as if it happened to myself. He'd finally opened up about his deepest, darkest secrets, and as a result, his memory had become my own. “How do you feel, Mr. Morrison?” I asked. “I- I- I feel great, Doctor. I feel... free,” he said, shocked, confused, but more than anything, relieved. James Morrison, one of my many patients suffering from some kind of horrific event that happened long in the past, plaguing him for each day of every year, always lingering in the back of his mind, preventing him from experiencing life for all of its beauty. It was only after years, if not decades of his wife pestering him to seek help, before he finally agreed to meet with me, and in only a few sessions, I'd essentially cured him. That's what I do, and what I've been doing for the past twenty-something years. I'm a psychiatrist with the bizarre ability to stealing people's memories. Traumatic events: Be it abuse, rape, accidents or other kinds of psychological or physical violence. Depending on how thorough I am, they may or may not retain knowledge of the event itself, but the emotion behind it is always removed; What they saw, how they felt, how it affected them, those are the parts that trouble people, what haunts them for years after the fact. Once I'm done with them, they'll have a basic understanding about what occurred during that time, but it'll be morphed into distant recollection, as if it happened to someone else. It doesn't minimize what they experienced, or make it less important, but it helps them deal with the past, and continue to live life, more or less free of the horrors they had to go through. Of course, I wish I could simply extract, and erase the memories, but what I've learned during my life is that the truth can never be removed entirely. Whatever I steal from my clients, be it the whole event, or just the pain, it sticks with me, lingering inside my head. Through the stolen memories, I've seen children who were witness to murder; I've seen people raped, teenagers bullied to the brink of suicide, abuse, violent acts, war and horrible accidents... Whatever the case may be, my treatment requires that the events are isolated enough for me to extract them. Single occurrences are the easiest, but even if they are confined to months or even years, it's also an option, though it requires more time and work on my end. No one knows about my ability, even my clients don't understand how I work, and they're all the better for it. To the rest of the world, I'm nothing more than a regular, albeit successful psychiatrist. I don't even know how I got this curse, but I vividly remember the first time I unintentionally used it to steal my best friend's happiness. We were kids, eleven years of age, and spending the better part of the summer together. My best friend: Neal, and I were working on a tree house, and as he often did, he was bragging about his family's wealth and their crazy adventures. I'll admit, I was envious that he kept getting all the things he asked for, simply having to point and receive; While my own parents struggled to make ends meet. Pets, video games and fancy holidays to sandy beaches, all the things a kid could ask for. Nonetheless, we were like brothers, and I would never have dreamed of hurting him intentionally. Alas, reality sometimes strikes down, and there's nothing you can do about it... When Neal bragged about his wealth, and told stories of expensive trips and crazy toys he'd just bought, I felt like I was there; His stories vivid beyond what my imagination could've conjured, and I felt his joy with each spoken word. Throughout the holiday, he seemed less and less joyful, as if his excitement had been taken from him. It was only when I brought up some of his own stories he'd told me, when I realized he'd quickly started to forget all the things that made him happy. The summer quickly ended, and the once lively boy had turned into a quiet husk of his former self. Everything that made him excited about life, had been erased, and put into my own head. And, while the positive emotions existed within me, it was a conflicting feeling of guilt; Even though I wasn't the brightest twelve year old in the world, I quickly realized I was the culprit behind Neal's sudden change. Neal never really found his way back from that summer. At the time I didn't understand the importance of joyful memories, and as often happens, we simply drifted apart. It would only be years later that I found out that he'd killed himself at the age of fifteen, following a tough, lengthy battle with depression. By then, I'd gotten a firm grasp on my cursed powers, and the news of his death hit me like a freight train. I decided then and there, that I'd spend the rest of my life making up for Neal's suffering, and that's what set me on a path to become a psychiatrist. For the next twenty-odd years, I studied, graduated and started working. Though most patients were treated as normal, using what I'd learned throughout my studies, some fit perfectly for my curse. With it, as they finally opened up, I could simply wander into their memory and snatch away what made them suffer. It came at a great personal cost, causing me sleepless nights and multiple flashbacks, but what was my own life worth against the hundreds I could help? These memories, as vivid as they were, didn't belong to me, which I took comfort in, but the sole knowledge that the images I saw weren't mine, wasn't enough. At times, unless I kept myself distracted, the emotions break through and I found myself only inches away from falling apart. That was my life, and until recently, I thought it would last until the end of my days... ...Then I met Harold Clifford. *** He came to my office for the first time during November, accompanied by a legal guardian dressed in an expensive suit. He didn't strike me as a special case the first time I met him. A scrawly man in his late sixties holding on to some half-repressed drama. A mentally scaring accident that had happened years ago back when mental health was a taboo topic. Honestly, I always enjoyed the elderly patients, they'd suffered for so long, often ashamed by their pasts. They were people who grew up in a generation where mental health wasn't as important as physical health, and it warmed my heart to see people finally accept that diseases affecting their psyche were as real as any other sickness. But, Harold Clifford was no ordinary case, a fact I learned during out very first session. I received a very peculiar set of instructions not from Mr. Clifford himself, but rather his guardian. I was told that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, which had left Mr Clifford mute. My job, as strange as it might sound, would be to tell him success stories about people overcoming any kind of mental distress. Despite my advice that there were more scientifically proven treatment options, he insisted that I just stick to the rules, and that I'd be compensated generously for my efforts. After some consideration, I came to the conclusion that it couldn't really cause any harm. So I sat down with Mr. Clifford, and told him stories, though not directly taken from prior patients, I have to admit that they were inspired by my previous cases as my imagination could only go so far. While we spoke, Mr. Clifford showed no outwards sign of distress, he simply sat and listened as I talked. I tried carefully encouraging him to speak, because there wasn't anything physically wrong with him, the aphasia stemmed from purely the psychological trauma, or so his caretaker said. I wanted to help him, I truly did, but with these restrictions, and inability to take his memories, I could do little but follow orders. *** That's how our meetings went on for the next couple of months. Mr. Clifford would sit in the chair, nodding along to my stories, never uttering a single word. Though I hardly believed there was any hope with the chosen therapy, he kept returning, and I kept getting paid. Only once we'd completed our tenth sessions, did I notice something odd about not the patient himself, but with me. I'd stayed behind after hours, trying to finalize some patient files before they were discharged. We only had a single person on the inpatient ward who'd had their memory removed, and I'd only kept him there for observation. I picked up his file and read the name: “James Morrison.” He'd suffered from depression and severe anxiety for the better part of his life, following a few years of childhood abuse. Now, after I'd managed to clean out most of his memory over the course of a month, he was almost ready to go home. I read over the case once, then twice, and realized that despite my best efforts, I couldn't remember the stories he'd told me. I knew we'd had sessions together, and I knew about his issues, but the memory itself was simply missing. After frantically reading over his history, I picked up another patient file: “Lisa Robertson,” again a person whose memory I had removed, and stuffed deep into the back of my own, yet I didn't remember any of it. Though the knowledge of them as patients still remained, alongside parts of our sessions. I couldn't remember what kind of trauma they'd gone through, what ailed them. With little consideration, my instinct and n uncanny gut feeling told me that the fault lay with Mr. Clifford. Luckily, he'd be my last patient for the following day. He came in early, and patiently awaited in the lobby while I finished my sessions. He sat down before me, and for the first time since I'd met him, his facial expression changed ever so slightly... ...he looked worried. It only lasted for the briefest of moments, before his casual facade returned. Despite the short duration, and with the implication that he wasn't who he appeared, I felt on edge. After all, he was a mute, which meant I didn't have to bother with drawn out small talk and greetings. With him, I got straight to the point. If anyone could keep a secret, it would be someone incapable of talking. “Mr. Clifford, something rather bizarre happened to me last night. I can't exactly explain it, but for whatever reason, I feel like our sessions have something to do with it.” His worried expression returned for a brief moment once more, and I instantly knew he felt threatened. “I think it might be better if we transfer you to a different therapist, I know some truly great ones that-” Before I could finish that sentence, he stood straight up from his chair and just stared at me. “Mr. Clifford, what are you doing?” I slowly tried to get to my own feet, but they wouldn't budge. Something about Mr. Clifford's intense stare kept me solidly locked in my chair. Then he walked towards me, step by step as I felt my consciousness drain away, fading to black before I could even call out for help. I'm not sure how he did it, nor how he snuck my unconscious body out without anyone's knowledge, but once I finally woke back up, I found myself bound to a chair in a dark room. As my eyes adjusted to their dim surroundings, I felt my head pounding with the worst migraine I'd ever experienced. I was in a large, windowless room surrounded by moldy, damp walls on all sides. No furniture, save for the chair I was handcuffed to and a light bulb dangling from the ceiling. The only exit was through a rusty, metal door, and it was blocked by Mr. Clifford himself, who just stood there, staring at me just as he had before I passed out. “Mr. Clifford, what are you doing, where am I?” I asked nervously. “Please, Harold, just let me out of here.” He approached me, never letting his gaze drift away from my eyes. I pulled on the handcuffs, making them dig into my skin, tearing it apart as blood started to trickle down onto the chair. “Wait, what are you-” I was cut off as intense pain shot through the back of my head, pounding away until I couldn't even speak. In the midst of my agony, I started seeing twisted images, plunging what was left of my sanity into darkness. Mr. Clifford had gotten a grip around the most vile, heartbreaking memories I had stolen, and he kept pulling them out from the back of my mind, forcing me to live through them as if they were happening then and there. “Stop it, please, just stop!” I screamed in a mixture of pain and horror, but he refused to relent. Within the boundaries of my own head, I was forced to witness the abuse of a young child, beaten with a belt for dropping a vase. Each slap hitting my back firmly felt as if it were real. A second passed, and the scene changed to that of a war zone. Sweat trickling down my back as I frantically tried to pull a wounded friend out of the line of fire. The hot landscape around me a mess of smoke and noise, disorientating me away from safety, as a bullet tore through my own thigh, shattering the bone into a million tiny fragments. Then I drowned, deep in the dark abyss of the ocean, a hand reaching out, unable to help me before my vision faded, not returning as my ribs cracked under the chest compressions of a stranger. Every now and then, between the horrors I had been forced to endure, I got a glimpse of Mr. Clifford standing before me, his emotionless face just staring deep into my agonized eyes. Torturing me for what felt like hours, before finally letting go. The rare moments he left the room were the worst. In the exhaustion I had fallen too weak to separate truth from reality. I kept waiting for the next horrific event, but they all blended together, making time itself feel like a meaningless stream of chaos. Once he returned, reality started twisting again. Among the nightmares, I would get a glimpse of Neal, his pleasant memories I had held onto since I was a mere boy. Alas, as soon as Mr. Clifford accidentally delved into something nice, he immediately retracted back out, shoving me further into the pain. Voices started filling my head, a symphony of pleas and screams. I couldn't even tell them apart, were they mine, or were they memories I had stolen? “Dad, it hurts, I'm sorry, please,” I mumbled to myself, stuck in another memory. “Am I going to die?” I asked as I bled profusely from a knife wound in my abdomen. Memories, hundreds of them shattered into meaningless pieces, serving as little more than torture devices. “I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...” Mr. Clifford jolted me back to reality for a moment, and I felt the scruff of a beard that had been growing on my chin over the course of a week. An intravenous line had been inserted into my arm, keeping me hydrated, and probably sedated. “Why are you doing this? Why don't you just kill me and get it over with?” I cried. It was the clearest moment I'd had in a week, and I could think of nothing other than begging for death. I prepared myself as best I could for the next round of mind warping, except, instead of the pain I'd come to know so well over the past week, I was just flung into darkness as Mr. Clifford knocked me unconscious. As I floated weightlessly in the void of emptiness. I couldn't cling to any memories, good or bad. I simply existed in peace wondering if I had finally succumbed to the mental wounds. Despite the implications of a dark empty hole, whether I lived or died, I just couldn't have cared any less... ...For the first time in decades, since I started stealing I felt happy. I'm not exactly sure what happened next. It all turned hazy once I was dragged back from the void. I remember waking up on the street, with paramedics carrying me into an ambulance, and the following stay at the hospital. Naturally, they wanted to know where I'd gone, who'd taken me and what they did to me, but I honestly couldn't tell them. Due to the trauma, I suffered from retrograde amnesia, and I would take the better part of a month to even regain most of my memories, including my own name and age. Mr. Clifford's very existence became nothing more than a vague idea, and with no official documentation that could confirm his identity, and the fake name he'd used at the clinic, little could be done to find him. I don't know exactly what happened next. My next and only memory for the next week include awaking in the hospital after being in a coma for a couple of days. The doctors told me I'd been found unconscious on the street, and proceeded to ask me what had happened, but I couldn't tell them. The trauma had caused retrograde amnesia. As I healed, and started remembering things. I realized a heavy burden had been lifted off my shoulders. While I could remember some of the flashes, they were mere ideas that didn't linger as an unpleasant emotion. I felt at ease, which sped up my recovery significantly, allowing me to return to work Even more, when I got back to my office, and looked over the patient files. I discovered that each and every memory I had stolen, were missing. No more nightmares, no more uncontrollable bursts of emotion when I had time to think. Through Mr. Clifford I had been given a second chance. I entered my office to greet my first patient for the day, and who stood there other than Mr. Clifford's personal caretaker. I froze in the door, ready to run to the reception and call the police. “Wait, I don't want to harm you!” he yelled. He sounded genuine enough for me to stop, but I kept one foot out the door. “Where's Mr. Clifford?” “He's resting,” the man said calmly. “What he did to you, well, it takes a toll.” “Why me, why keep me in that room?” “It was the only way, you weren't open, kept your memories hidden like a dark secret. You have a gift, and unless you learn to control it, you'll always suffer the way you keep going.” I took a step in and closed the door, still not willing to let anyone know about my curse. “I do it to help people.” “As do we, but we don't light ourselves on fire just to keep others warm. While you were a particularly hard case, we usually go about things smoother.” “Who are you?” “It doesn't matter, but if you ever wish to expand your gift, we're willing to help,” he said as he handed me a card containing a website link that consisted of a string of numbers. I've been given a new chance, and an opportunity to help myself, which of course meant I'd have to leave my job.

726,"There's a difference between ""living with kids"" and ""raising kids"". Choose the partner that makes you a better parent.I'm sitting here in my bed next to my sleeping fiancé counting my lucky stars. I've had an epiphany about dating while raising kids and I thought I'd share it with you all. I divorced my high school sweetheart when I was pregnant with our third child. I had found out he was having an affair with a mutual acquaintance and I was out. I met my kid-free fiancé a few months after my son was born at a karaoke bar. I was mentally unstable (therapy did help with this) and living in survival mode. My kids were well taken care of. They had everything that they needed. But I wasn't raising them. I was just living with them. It hurts to admit this, but I don't remember very much of my third pregnancy and my son's first few months of life. The trauma of a suicide attempt, my divorce, delivering my son 6 weeks early, and his days in the NICU weighed a heavy toll on me. I coped by blocking everything out. It didn't help that I was unemployed and away from close family. Most of our close friends were mutual friends, too. I was lucky enough to have finished my PhD during my last pregnancy and shortly thereafter found an amazing job that I love and pays well so I'm doing great now. But those first few months after my son's birth were rough. Anyway back to my point. I was very slow to introduce my fiancé to my kids. And even then, I was sure to keep my kids out of his way. For example, I would make sure I only allowed my fiancé to come over during the weekends I knew the kids would be with their dad. I spent so much energy making sure that my kids were not a burden to my fiancé. When my fiancé did ask if he could spend more time with the kids, I was shocked. Even then, I made sure to handle everything related to the kids, like cooking their meals, keeping them occupied so they wouldn't bother my fiancé, etc. It took almost two years for me to get out of this mode. Every single responsibility that my fiancé took with the kids was initiated by him. I let him decide how involved he wanted to be. I was so used to taking care of everything and everyone, so that's what I continued to do. A few things happened about a year ago that changed things. My fiancé and I moved in together and my son started showing delays. At the same time, my middle daughter started showing signs of giftedness. My fiancé showed up with me to doctors appointments, consultations, and my son's therapy. He did his research and came up with activities to help my son progress. At the same time, he created a plan to help my middle daughter grow academically. He has shown up to school conferences, games, and practices for my eldest. He is very intentional about the way he interacts with the kids. We talk often about the things we are teaching the kids, what habits and life lessons we want the kids to learn, and ways we can go about teaching them. My kids have grown so much. My fiancé has absolutely made me a better parent. Everyone in this household is so much happier and well adjusted than they were three years ago. I've realized that these are not my kids. These are our kids. As the eldest has put it, ""He's not mom's fiancé, he is our dad.""",
727,"Dr. K is honestly changing my lifeI believe I saw a post the other day about Dr. K, a Harvard psychiatrist who streams [on twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/healthygamer_gg) about mental health especially as it relates to gamers. I can't emphasize enough how much I think he could help everyone on here. I'm posting my notes on a few of his videos below, but I definitely don't do it justice. If you find it at all helpful or interesting you should check him out. Healthy Gamer Moments **Knowing Yourself** 1. External vs Internal Standards a. Take a step back. Medicine is about population – about averages not individuals. The “2,000 calories a day” meme is not based on any science. Instead, it is just based on the average of some 50-year-old self-report survey. When it comes to things like governing how you want to live YOUR life, you can’t rely on these average prescriptions. Use external factors to form hypotheses but test them for yourself. Obviously, there are instances where referencing an average can be useful, for instance if you are a physician you will want to know more than most of the population, otherwise you wouldn’t be a great physician. People who have problems finding peace or happiness often have a comparative mindset. Focus on yourself, not other people. b. Delaying gratification. “When I get emotional my ability to delay gratification and control my impulses goes down… The better I get at delaying gratification the less power emotions will have over me.” Reciprocal inhibition. We make bad decisions when we are emotional. c. Callings. Most human beings when they have an intention are impeded by negative feelings or outcomes. Being able to suffer through negative feelings and emotions gives you control/freedom/agency of your life. A calling is something you feel a duty or obligation to do. A job is what society tells you to do, a calling is what you feel you need to do. Stop looking at what other people do, think about what you enjoy, want to do, what you think is wrong with the world. d. Looking into yourself involves figuring out things that you are uniquely apt to do. e. We are never taught about how we work, which is why we now need to learn about ourselves. 2. Meditation, Emotions, and the Self a. Example: Cancer patients asked to rate their pain 1-10. Most rate it at around 9. The patients are then taught to meditate over the course of a month or two. We come back and ask the patients what they rate their pain… It is still 9. However, some people found it incredibly helpful because they can now put a “window” between themselves and their pain. They take less pain medication despite same pain because their ability to tolerate higher levels of pain is better. b. Not talking in class due to anxiety. Not asking a girl out in fear of rejection. Where does this come from? The brain is not stupid. Anxiety is a learned behavior and works as a protective mechanism. Kids, especially gamer kids, learn early on from bullying that when people are looking at me, I am in danger. Early impacts like this affect our programming for the rest of our life. We might know it is irrational, but we can still have physiological responses from talking in front of people at dinner for example. c. The observing self. The “soul” or “consciousness” is separate from the thinking mind. In wakefulness, you are conscious and thinking. In sleep, you are unconscious and not thinking. Dreaming is different, you have thoughts but not consciousness. Daydreaming is also thoughts without consciousness since you are not aware of what is going on. Meditation is our word for consciousness without thought. d. Studying things objective and external like science causes you to have to deconstruct a lot of presumptions in order to understand your true self. A six-year-old probably has a better sense of self than you. Leonardo DaVinci quote, “It took me my entire life to paint like a child.” Hammered this point home with a story of enlightenment. Some guy wanted to be enlightened more than anything, and when he eventually gave up on everything he was told to do, he realized he was finally enlightened. e. “The way to understand what your consciousness is is to check into it in all kinds of different moments.” Sometimes meditation allows you to see a horrifying/awe-inspiring emptiness inside yourself. f. Even though someone who has meditated for years might face the same emotional pain as anyone one else (i.e. their cancer pain is still a 9) they struggle less with the effects. 3. Videogames a. Why do people play videogames? Because it’s easy. b. Does videogame addiction exist despite lack of studies? Yes. How do we decide whether someone is depressed or not? DSM was invented to identify people with depression. Created by fiat, we just decided if you meet 5 of 9 conditions you are depressed. It is not all chemical imbalances. You can’t test for depression. It is a clinical diagnosis. This is unlike testing for many diseases like HIV and seeing an actual virus in someone. A lot of medicine is not scientific. c. Adolescent suicide has increased 50% in past seven years. 4:1 ratio of men committing suicide to women. d. IQ not equivalent to success. So many high IQ gamers stuck gaming because they never learn to deal with emotional pain. Videogames select for high IQ kids. In school, they complete a task and are no longer challenged for the day, but if they play videogames, the game is perfectly paced to you. When you finish the challenge level two is there waiting for you. e. Brain does not differentiate between real life rewards and videogame rewards. Dopamine response is equivalent to how difficult task is. If you turn on god-mode cheats, the game becomes less fun, if you play Dark Souls, it feels amazing when you do well. Videogames are addictive not because of the reward but because the denial of the reward. Takeaway: Look to yourself for answers instead of external “barometers.” Think about what you want to do and write down what is getting in the way. Answer will probably be cognitive, think about the emotions you have when you think about doing it. Ex: If you wanted a job, when you go to apply for a job notice what you feel that resists this and write it down. Then tunnel down into the emotions you feel. Be aware of that (for now). **Victim Mentality** 1. Victim mentality is like being in an abusive relationship with herself. a. Why do people stay in abusive relationships? People like the familiar. b. Example of someone whose Dad was constantly berating her, so she continued to do that to herself in her adult life. A form of trauma. c. If you are in an abusive relationship you don’t believe you deserve to be with someone better **Motivation Psychology (short)** 1. The feeling of overwhelmed a. The instinct when you feel overwhelmed is to do less. b. Passive vs active challenges. Active challenges are the things we choose to do. Usually things you want to do or at least that you planned to do. Passive challenges are the things life throws at you, chores, random problems, etc. c. When you feel overwhelmed it is because your passive challenges are outweighing your active challenges. People think the solution is to reduce the problems life throws at you. This is hard to do and has problems. The other solution is to take on more active challenges. This also lets you take control of yourself. d. You build up energy by taking on more tasks. Anxiety is just an excess of mental energy. “Clean your room” is a way to make yourself feel better. **Meditation Changes your Body** 1. Breathing in meditation increases CO2 levels in your brain. When you meditate for prolonged periods of time, your heart is acclimatized (not damaging). This sends signals to create collateral circulation. If you get a blocked artery the damage will be way less because you have different pathways for circulation. Could easily save you from heart attacks. **High Achieving People with Low Self Worth** 1. When high achieving people go from being the best all the time in middle school, high school, college, and suddenly become average in law school, their identity is completely shot. Loads of people create an identity of themselves comparatively, but if you can avoid that, you should be fine. **How to Stop Procrastinating** 1. Don’t try. Do or fail. Trying is the problem. Failing is great. Doing is great. Trying prevents you from actually doing anything. 2. People think the way you get confident is through success, but really it is through failure. 3. To people who say the first step is the hardest: There is no first step. There is only one step. Future-thinking is daunting. We are in the present at all times. Just do the one step in the present. The idea of future keeps you from doing what you want. Just keep doing the one step right now. a. But can’t future thinking be helpful? Of course. But the future thinking mind is only one part of your mind. You need to be able to control your future thinking mind. The root of procrastination is an overblown future thinking mind, and overblown future thinking can cause anxiety. Stop letting that part run the show. **Success as an Introvert and Social Skills** 1. What do you think of the 16 personality/Myers-Briggs test? Big Five? a. It is not independently validated. Not many studies to show it is valid. I think it can be useful, based on Carl Jung. Useful in the same way a horoscope can be. b. The Big Five is a good assessment of personalities. It says people can be put on a set of 5 spectrums. Introversion/Extroversion, Agreeableness, Openness (good predictor of political belief. More open = more liberal), Neuroticism, Conscientiousness. Two best traits to become rich are high neuroticism and high conscientiousness. c. People can change. d. We often think of personalities in the context of better or worse. Really, we ought to think about how we can best apply our personalities to our lives. e. If you’re not going anywhere in life, you may think it is because you are not doing enough. However, it could be you are spread too thin. Takeaway: Play to your strengths.",
728,"LONG post: Living with Explosive MIL*TW: Self-harm? Suicide/al thoughts?* Hi y’all. Don’t know why I waited this long but here’s my first post. I’ll try my best to be comprehensible. It’s been a while since it started and I think it’s just so painful for me that I have a hard time remembering the details, on top of English being my 2nd language. So, SO sorry it’s long! I do not consent for this post to be shared in any other website. My MIL and I had a rocky start. We only met for the first time when she moved to the states a little before DH and I got married 5.5 years ago. She seemed meek and quiet then, though I noticed her being controlling on one occasion. Next time we met was when she stayed with us two weeks before my BIL’s arrival to spend winter break with us. (She lived in a different state.) My mistake is I’m very introverted then and suddenly having technically a stranger in my living space just made me close up. It didn’t help that both of us are not talkative with new people either. Even in the same room it was super awkward so I spent most time with my recovering DH in whichever room he was. I guess at one point I triggered her and she EXPLODED in a screeching tirade about how I was purposely making her feel unwelcome. Thing is most of what she said were assumptions, like how I hit my foot on the chair IN the dark and how my clumsy-ass hand slipped when putting the toilet seat down were my efforts to get her less sleep. How ‘this whore’ is misleading her son. She blamed me for making DH so stern (it was the military). She’d make comments that would make me feel insecure with myself personally and physically. To give you a picture of the severity: she could do these rage screaming sessions from morning to night with short breaks in between, for days. A 5’0” woman. Her second stay with us, I counted her screaming almost 6 hours straight at one point as I covered myself in the blanket in tears for the same length. I have desperately explained to her that they are all accidental and pleaded forgiveness, if she has it in heart as taught by the religion she so devoutly follows. During her stay, I, a PCOS sufferer, was so stressed I actually lost a chunk of weight. I was so scared to wake her up if I go to the bathroom near the bedroom, I got UTI. I lost sleep as I was so traumatized and had to sleep on the couch while she slept in our room with DH (yup) and she didn’t want to be in the same room. It kickstarted my self-harming and my depressive thoughts. I have a hard time looking her straight in the eyes ever since because it just reminded me of how much mental pain she caused. She thought I’m an attention-seeker because I left the house silently after throwing the trash (because I couldn’t stand being in the apt under her terror). She hid all the knives, even the butter knives, in the apt probably not wanting me to get an upper hand by killing myself or hurting her. She went in our closet to look for our marriage certificate with the intent to destroy it. I, knowing what she’d do, had hidden it... She ended up accidentally finding my “toys” (not sorry). I don’t remember how that visit ended but I remember it impacted me so much that when I was really drunk shortly after she went home, I had somehow thought my husband would leave me because of her and I had a meltdown. I can’t count the amount of fights with my DH caused by our turbulent relationship with her. Following encounters are as above at it’s worse and lukewarm at it’s best; mainly VLC as she lived at another state. One time when on the road for DH’s bday trip, she called to congratulate him and after it somehow escalated to a screaming match, she said I MUST be laughing at her. I didn’t although I really wanted to laugh in pity of how this woman is full of paranoia with zero self esteem. Past Thanksgiving, it was DH‘s turn to trigger her. I stayed in our closet in hiding. We were only saved from a week of screaming because we surprised her on her birthday night, and that’s after she threw her early bday present handbag to DH’s face. This winter break, she was supposed to stay for the 2 weeks. She ended up getting fired (bc her boss was also nuts) and DH insisted she move in with us. She didn’t even have the courtesy to ask permission from me. First month living with her, I just noticed more and more how BEC she is. She’d 90% complain when we take her out to eat. Too salty, too bland, too much MSG. She would give unsolicited and sometimes unfounded ”advice”. She thinks she‘s always right. She keeps pestering me about using all this oils or beauty products for my acne-scarred face. One time I cooked, she off-handedly said to my BIL, “oh, how are we gonna finish this. I don’t like this sweet-tasting soup. I won’t eat it again.” I was right next to her. She would cook almost every day because she‘s bored, even though DH had warned her not to cook so much, and our fridge is full of her stuffs, in all of our pyrexes. My patience was running thin and we don’t even know how long she’s staying. We’re hoping she’d move out in a year once BIL graduates from graduate school. They both live rent-free with us. Anyway, she exploded again last Friday on my day off after working so many hours the past two weeks. DH with his tone issues triggered her when she didn’t like his tone and what he had said. She was asking where the food she cooked is. Nobody could hear well most of the time in our high-ceiling house, so she kept asking “where‘s the food?” from the kitchen and he replied several times but she had kept asking so he blurted, “omg, stop being so paranoid like we would have thrown your food away.” She went on another tirade of how she didn’t want to move here and blaming DH for pushing her to. She felt tired and unappreciated for her cooking (it was just some simple things which DH requested bc she seemed to want to cook). Started bringing me up, referring me in third person as “your wife” in front of my face, while DH went in the bedroom trying deescalate the situation. Complaining oh, how lazy your wife is and what are you two gonna do if you have a child. She said she definitely wouldn’t want to take care of the child (like I would leave my child with this lunatic). So I told DH I can’t live like this for a WHOLE year in our OWN house feeling like a prisoner. She was snappy the whole weekend even with my poor BIL who took her out to places so we don’t have to meet... since after that, we have been doing this awkward dance of limiting contact with her. I had confided in my work teammates today about this. My boss mentioned I still laughed while talking about it. My colleague said she would’ve flipped a long time ago. I think it’s due to my brain FOGged for so long to think that this is normal, on top of some cultural mores. Boss also said DH must have some special needs issues, which led me to thinking that MIL probably has a more severe mental issues. I really want her out but DH feels bad to throw them out. He repeatedly asked me to ass-lick MIL so it’d be better for all of us. I can’t find it in my heart any ounce of forgiveness to do that. I’ve been waking up exhausted ever since she moved in, which I suspect from the anxiety of living with a living, ticking time bomb. I’ve been increasingly more depressive as I loose sleep and I really wish for an out of this situation... Tl;dr: I have to withstand MIL’s lengthy, explosive, abusive rage tirades for an unforeseen amount of time at the expense of my sanity and probably my marriage.",
729,"A proposed scale for ranking feminist attitudes to male issuesCritics of feminism are often accused of treating feminism as a monolith. Whereas anti-feminists argue feminism deserves blame for the ways it's reinforced men's problems, pro-feminists argue feminism deserves credit for instances in which it's addressed various male issues. Other pro-feminist arguments include that misandrists are marginalized within the feminist movement, that feminism has recently moved away from its anti-male tendencies, and long lists of feminist activism on male issues. What sometimes gets lost in this heated debate is that we're talking about a complex set of issues, so there are a wide range of possible positions on those issues. That means there is no binary dichotomy that sharply divides misandrists and egalitarians - rather, feminists have a *spectrum* of attitudes toward men. The problem is not so much that feminists never address male issues; it's more that there’s usually a feminist bias in *which* male issues they focus on and how they frame those issues. So in this post I propose a scale that might help us classify feminists by their various stances on men's issues. The advantage of a scale is that it more precisely assigns credit and blame where it is due. It commends where there are good ideas, and rewards where there is observable progress, while still criticizing where there remains room for improvement. Many advocacy groups use scales to rank politicians on particular issues; my scale could be applied to feminist individuals, organizations, subreddits, factions, etc. Feminists and undecided observers should perceive this as a more reasonable stance than total anti-feminism. (My scale does not cover right-wing attitudes toward men because they are based in a different ideology. But of course, I often point out how right-wing ideas harm men, see for example [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/wiki/missionstatement#wiki_how_do_we_differ_from_right-wing_anti-feminists.3F) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/ecootb/a_rant_against_honey_badger_radios_interview_of/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates/comments/eph2qc/virginia_ratifies_the_equal_rights_amendment/fejpl10/).) My proposed scale orders men's issues roughly based on how much feminists are disinclined to acknowledge and/or fight them. This is actually pretty easy to do because there is an underlying principle: it’s based on how much a particular male issue conflicts with women’s interests and/or the feminist ideological framework. So each point on my scale is defined by the most ideologically challenging male issue(s) that a particular feminist speaks out against. Lower rankings on the scale reflect more misandrist approaches, while higher rankings reflect more compatibility with male advocacy. The scale currently has eleven points numbered 0-10, because 10 seems a nice round number: **0. No male issues.** The open misandrists who don’t even pretend to care about men and may see men as biologically misogynist. They may advocate explicitly anti-male laws treating women as a protected class (like Catharine Mackinnon), or they may even advocate gendercide. Some extend their hatred to transgender people. They use rhetoric like “men are the enemy”, “the entire world is men’s studies”, and “men’s rights activists are the abusers’ lobby”. In mainstream society this camp are now on the backfoot outside Sweden, but online they are rapidly regrouping in new spaces like r/pinkpillfeminism. Meghan Murphy is an example of this category. **1. Male violence.** The “men’s groups”, “men’s helplines”, and “teach men not to rape” classes that are all about men learning to stop being violent towards women. These feminists “help” men only in the sense of discouraging men from committing harshly punished crimes and maybe incidentally discouraging violence against other men (which in reality is the majority of male violence). Their main difference from level 0 is they think men can be reformed. Rosie Batty, the Duluth model, and the White Ribbon Campaign are in this category. **2. Toxic masculinity.** This camp focuses on a subset of masculine norms which don’t particularly benefit women in modern society. These can include male-on-male violence and bullying, homophobia, the expectation that boys be strong and tough and like sports, etc. If pressed, they might condemn militarism and/or male genital mutilation. This camp demonizes masculinity as a code of male dominance, and shames men for normal sexual desires and behaviours (eg. porn viewing). They generally avoid mentioning the real underlying function of masculine norms, the monogamous protector-provider role – except when they promote it as a new improved “positive masculinity”. This is the camp of *The Mask You Live In*, the Gillette ad, and Michael Kimmel (before [he got metooed](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/08/10/michael-kimmels-former-student-putting-name-and-details-those-harassment-rumors)). **3. Men’s mental health.** This camp talks a good game on male suicide and men not being able to express their emotions, and maybe some really do care. But often the only reason they care is because they think it causes male violence, and the only cause they acknowledge is an internalized “toxic masculinity” which is implicitly blamed on men. There’s no consideration of any external discrimination affecting men’s mental health, nor of feminists telling men to shut up making men reluctant to open up. There may even be some feminist therapists treating their male clients as “privileged” (eg. in couples counselling). The American Psychological Association, and seemingly most of feminism’s real-world activism on men’s issues, fall into this category. **4. The male breadwinner role.** Many liberal feminists are happy to oppose the male breadwinner role inasmuch as it helps career women climb the corporate ladder, so they’ll support paternity leave and other policies that make it easier for men to take on a childrearing role. But they’re missing in action when a father wants to continue being involved after divorce, or when a man wants to avoid being coerced into parenthood in the first place. They’ll also avoid mentioning the remaining points on this list, where male interests can come into conflict with female interests. An example of this category is Hillary adviser Anne-Marie Slaughter, whose limited concern for males is betrayed by her role in advocating more war. **5. Working-class male disposability.** Unlike those feminists who are totally identity-obsessed, the more socialist-leaning feminists (and even some second-wave radfems due to their socialist background) acknowledge and seek to address some ways men are mistreated by society. Their focus varies but may include dangerous working conditions, stagnating wages, technological unemployment, homelessness, problems with the criminal justice system, war and conscription, and defending Julian Assange. This camp typically focuses on how both men and women are treated by plutocrats running corporations and states, a narrative which contains much truth. But they place a bit too much blame on elite men, ignoring how women benefit from the protection and resources acquired by male soldiers conquering other nations and male executives climbing the economic ladder. Most of the far left falls somewhere around here so it’s a broad category ranging from anti-idpol socialists, to misandrists like Caitlin Johnstone who believe more female power would create a gentler society. **6. Female-on-male violence.** There is an increasing willingness to acknowledge male rape victims in particular, because it helps bolster the feminist narrative that rape is the worst possible crime. Many feminists now also acknowledge the broader issue of female-on-male intimate partner violence and criticize the Duluth model. But they might downplay its prevalance, and probably still defend women who exploit, manipulate, or unfairly blame their male partners without rising to the level of violence. They’ll avoid any discussion of what happens when an abusive woman accuses her male partner of abusing her, and may promote dubious statistics claiming to prove false rape accusations are rare. This is roughly about as far as r/MensLib goes most of the time, and was forbidden territory pre-2010s as evidenced by the treatment of Erin Pizzey. **7. Male-female relationship norms and disputes.** Some of the more egalitarian-minded feminists will acknowledge at least some of the male grievances surrounding divorce courts, child custody, child support, and male reproductive rights. Some might even acknowledge the more day-to-day chivalric norms like whether men should be expected to make decisions, pay on dates, and be blamed when things go wrong. These issues are among the most important litmus tests for whether a woman truly opposes misandry, because they concern how the average woman treats men in her everyday relationships. Karen DeCrow was an example of this category and was marginalized by NOW for it. **8. Male sexual issues.** Some of the most sex-positive feminists acknowledge the demonization of male sexuality, and men tending to receive a low level of sexual attention. They may even acknowledge the problem of many women treating their sexuality as a commodity in the style of r/femaledatingstrategy. Vaush and Jessica Valenti might be examples of feminists who somewhat lean into this category (**EDIT:** others have pointed out reasons why Valenti wouldn't score this well on the scale). Ironically, sex worker activists also tend to say positive things about male sexuality and sexual freedom, though obviously their business depends on the same commodity model. **9. Lack of due process for accused men.** These rare voices are brave enough to call out the dodgy campus rape tribunals, the vague definitions of sexual harassment, and the extralegal social-media witch-hunts against men on the mere accusation of any sexual misconduct. This point is difficult to rank on the scale because a few mavericks jump over the middle points to call out this one (particularly women concerned about their sons or their own sexual prospects) – but I think it is sufficiently taboo within feminist circles to be placed at number 9. Katie Roiphe might be an example of this category. **10. Exposing feminist misandry.** Only the occasional feminist is willing to go beyond “Patriarchy Hurts Men Too” by pointing out how the feminist narrative reinforces traditional negative stereotypes of men as more powerful, more malicious, and less vulnerable than women. This problem is acknowleged mainly by right-leaning feminists on the movement’s outer edge (eg. Christina Hoff-Sommers), who tend to hold other right-wing beliefs that are problematic toward men. Among left-wing feminists, some trans feminists like Ozy Frantz may come closest to acknowledging the problem, due to their clashes with TERFs and having experienced living as more than one gender. This category may also include many “coffee-shop” feminists who are out of touch with movement propaganda. Of course, even an eleven-category scale cannot cover *all* feminists – some individuals will hold a mix of positions on the scale. This scale does not consider factors such as rhetoric, tendency to silence critics, and the subjective judgement of who is taking an issue seriously and who is giving lip service. For example, [the Lindy West article quoted by “Big Red”](https://jezebel.com/if-i-admit-that-hating-men-is-a-thing-will-you-stop-tu-5992479) might even get a 9 on the scale due to sheer comprehensiveness, but arguably she only brought up the first 9 points to say she remains extremely opposed to point 10. West dogmatically defends the feminist ideological framework, denies the existence of misandry, claims all men hold power because of elite men, blames every male issue on “patriarchy”, claims feminism is already working on men’s issues, and even blames men for feminists hating men. So your mileage may vary on how much credit West deserves. The scale is not necessarily intended to demonize every low-ranking feminist, as some individuals might be open-minded to learning new information that would move them up the scale. They may be well-intentioned but unaware of the limitations of their highly-censored echo chambers, and genuinely perplexed about why their approach to male issues fails to impress us. Moving people from the anti-male end to the pro-male end of the above scale should be a major goal of male advocacy. If my scale ever becomes popularized, maybe it could even be used to place pressure on feminists to up their game on men’s issues. What do you think? Does my scale make sense? Does it seem like it could be useful? Have I left out anything important?",

Book Ranking: 1. The Tower of the Swallow 2. Time of Contempt 3. Blood of Elves 4. Baptism of Fire 5. The Lady of the Lake # Reviews: # Blood of Elves **Overall Thoughts:** *For the smallest book in the saga, this does a fine job of setting everything up. Although quite a necessary info dump at the beginning, it is told in a very clever way: all races underneath Bleobheris tree debating the state of the world. This book is also one long procession of people coming to act as surrogate family members to Ciri after the fall of Cintra. They all impart their view of the world to her about the history of the elves and the current threat of the Scoia’tael. After Cintra was conquered at the end of the short stories, all other characters are now scrambling to find Ciri in the power vacuum that was created.* **Likes:** *I love the scenes at Kaer Morhen. They are fun, comforting, and it is the last time in the saga that we ever meet another witcher (until Coën shows up dead at the battle of Brenna in LotL). Rience makes a strong presence early on as the 'dragon' working for a higher, unknown evil. I felt all three main characters were well developed even if you hadn’t read any of the short stories. I found it hilarious that none of the northern kings trust each other not to find Ciri for themselves so they just agree to have her killed instead.* **Dislikes:** *I didn’t understand what the intent was behind making Triss fall ill of a stomach bug; other than to have them join Yarpen’s caravan. This could have been achieved in other ways. To put her in such an undignified position felt unnecessary to me. The time jumps between chapters 1 and 2 and then 4 and 5 were a little disjointed and were more reminiscent of the short story collections rather than a novel. It left me feeling like we missed a lot that had happened after Ciri arrived at Kaer Morhen and then also after the caravan was attacked. Had Sapkowski drawn up a map for new reader, the geography discussions in chapter 6 would have been much easier to understand.* # Time of Contempt **Overall Thoughts:** *This is the book where all hell breaks loose. All characters’ true allegiances are suddenly revealed. The three protagonists are never the same again and are scattered quite literally to different ends of the Continent. I found it really interesting that the key moments of the coup were not described first hand. A lot was told to the reader after the fact via Keira Metz’s account to Geralt. This book was quite narrowly focussed in a good way. The northern kings prove just how cowardly they are when the threat of Nilfgaard finally arrives.* **Likes:** *I love the characters of Codringher and Fenn: the shady private investigators/information brokers. I thought they would serve as Geralt's private eyes and ears throughout the saga but sadly they were killed too soon. Some of the best scenes are the reunions of Geralt/Yennefer/Ciri. All the more tragic as these are the last times they will be all together until the finale in LotL. Vilgefortz trying and failing to charm and recruit Geralt and learning of his rags to riches story was a treat to read.* **Dislikes:** *The Thanedd Coup could have easily filled up two chapters and didn't go into enough detail. I didn’t like that the fall of Lyria and Aerdirn were told from the perspectives of minor characters who play no role in the future plot. I would have much preferred Jaskier to just tell Geralt what happened firsthand as their dialogue is always wonderful. Likewise there was far too much attention paid to Aplegatt at the expense of building up Yennefer and Ciri's short time together.* # Baptism of Fire **Overall Thoughts:** *This book was almost entirely dedicated to developing Geralt’s hanza and camaraderie. There is very little Ciri in this book and almost no Yennefer at all. Filippa recovers very quickly from her failed coup attempt. She puts full effort into establishing the Lodge with her as its leader (despite it being an ostensibly equal Arthurian round table). This book highlights Geralt’s magnetism and that people will follow him into the gates of hell and toward certain death just because of who he is. Ciri turning to evil deeds was as shocking as was the new reality of a warn torn north.* **Likes:** *I really appreciated the more lighthearted tone of this book after the emotional roller coaster that was ToC. Regis the vegetarian vampire character was hilarious. Reading about the group bonding over mandrake moonshine and fish soup, I felt like I was right there with them having a ball. The fact that this hanza is possibly the most dangerous group ever assembled on the Continent was amazing with each of the characters being outcasts in their own right. Examining Milva’s internal conflict and feelings for Geralt was really well written as was her pregnancy. The Battle of Red Port Bridge was an unexpectedly exciting battle despite the writing being a bit clunky and hard to follow at times.* **Dislikes:** *I didn’t enjoy when we cut to the Rats for small sections at a time. It seemed like this was just to remind us about Ciri. Ciri’s time with the Rats was necessary to prepare her for what is to come and unfortunately I felt like this arc was a little under-cooked. I can't believe the hanza didn't slaughter more people. I found Geralt being knighted by Meve so that he formerly becomes ‘Geralt of Rivia’ was a little cheesy and contrived. The overarching plot does not progress very much other than physical territory covered. The pace is quite slow for a third act.* # The Tower of the Swallow **Overall Thoughts:** All *of the plot threads finally start to have some payoff and resolution in this book. This is where Ciri reaches breaking point and finally decides to stop running and take the fight right to her enemies. I was really surprised at just how much of a left turn the saga took with Bonhart’s violent sadism. I didn’t expect this out of Sapkowski. Ciri’s character is permanently affected by these events. Vilgefortz loses his two co-dragons Rience and Schirrú but manages to convince Skellen and Bonhart to replace them. Dijkstra sets up the large-scale war arc to come in The Lady of the Lake.* **Likes:** *I loved Vysogota’s hermit scholar character and how he gives Ciri the balanced mentorship she desperately needs. Using Vysogota as a framing device worked exceptionally well here. I loved Bonhart’s character as a nihilistic sociopath where he goes rogue from everyone and sells out to the highest bidder. Rience and Schirrú both meeting their ends in violent ways after all the harm they have caused was really satisfying. I liked finally learning about what Ciri's Elder Blood powers actually are from Avallac’h and the mysticism around Tor Zireael. Yennefer receiving validation as a mother from the goddess Freya herself was touching. Ciri’s ‘death on skates’ scene was fantastically tense and really suited the change in her character. The moment that Tor Zireael appears saving Ciri from Bonhart was the perfect cliffhanger.* **Dislikes:** *I didn’t really ‘get’ Angoulême’s character. It’s like she was shoe-horned into the plot to act as a stand-in for Ciri because Geralt couldn’t be with her; complete with flaxen hair, uncouth attitude, and Cintran accent. She just seemed like a less developed Milva character. The pace of the story slowed noticeably during the two consecutive chapters about Kovir and then Skellige. These could have been cut down considerably. The Skellige chapter should have been placed right after Geralt realizes he is being tracked by magic in Chapter 5. This would have drastically improved the pacing. The Rats definitely needed to be killed off as they had served their purpose however it was a bit unceremonious and seemed a bit too convenient to happen so quickly.* # The Lady of the Lake **Overall Thoughts:** *This is the book that resolves everything (well, sort of). The tone of the saga changes from one continuous story into part Arthurian legend, part science fiction. Although I understand the reasons, I felt this digression upstaged the actual plot in many ways and was a bit too self-indulgent by the author. Unfortunately there was also too much 'mind screw' for me to place this book any higher on my ranking. This book follows the most disjointed timeline of the whole series. I am in two minds about the ending. Normally I like sagas like this to have definitive closure for the investment of time I have put in. I don’t mind this one being ambiguous although I prefer when there are enough clues left along the way for astute readers to work out the truth. I felt the clues we did get were too contradictory or downright nonsensical.* **Likes:** *The Battle of Brenna was one of the finest war sections I have ever read in a piece of fiction. It is amazing how much was conveyed with none of the main protagonists present. Most of it taking place away from the battlefield was a masterclass in unconventional action scene storytelling. I loved the death flashbacks of the hanza and the villain showdowns. I loved all the karmic deaths like Bonhart being killed by the very sword he acquired for Ciri, Vilgefortz being killed because he can’t detect an illusion and his face being disfigured as retribution for Lydia. Filippa being thwarted at every turn despite her network of informers and Geralt playing Fringilla for the fool was great. Thinking about Geralt and Ciri effortlessly slaughtering Skellen’s goons while slowly walking down the staircase (which we have been waiting for 4 books to get to) made my soul smile. Sapkowski made me feel the same level of emotional exhaustion that the characters were feeling by this point. The reveal of Duny's identity was outstanding.* **Dislikes:** *This book has too much filler. As much as I love Toussaint (Blood & Wine), I think these chapters could have been severely cut down. With the book weighing in at almost five hundred and fifty pages, the entire chapter of Jarre traveling to Vizima could have been cut completely. I felt like we followed Jarre in this book as much as Geralt or Ciri which was precious time wasted. I thought it was a bit unimaginative to have Geralt learn of Vilgefortz’s location by accident. The chapter about the Aen Elle felt like it had huge promise and would tie all of the Elder Blood prophecies together. Instead it was excessively cryptic and left me feeling unsatisfied with more questions than answers. Like in ToS, the hanza being killed off so unceremoniously and quickly was too reminiscent of The Rats. I was disappointed that Ciri didn't use her space/time travel abilities in combat to full effect (although she kind of did this with Bonhart albeit with unintended effects). I was a bit let down by how much of a nobody Vilgefortz turned out to be in the end. As soon as he lost Ciri on Thanedd and double crossed Emhyr he was left practically powerless and confined to his lair.* If you made it to the end, thanks for reading!",
731,"The Government vs. Moon TheoryLocal58, boy oh boy is it amazing. I have just recently watched the series and I was so enthralled that I decided to research into it and form my own theory. I'll describe it in chronological order using information from A Look Back that correlates with each style of Local58. I know that more videos are coming, but I hope that they only reinforce my theory. **Introduction:** Local58 is a television broadcast channel run at 476 MHz. 476 MHz puts it in the range of frequencies for Broadcast Television Service, Industrial/Business Radio Service, Offshore Radiotelephone Service, and the Public Safety Radio Service. All of these have been used by the Youtube channel except for Offshore Radiotelephone Service, but if the trend is followed there may be a future video detailing events in the Gulf of Mexico region. The logo for Local58 displays WCLV-TV. Related or not, WCLV is the name of an Ohio radio station and possibly is only a nod to wherever the channel creator lives. Currently, the channel spans from the late 1960s to early 2010s starting from Contingency to You Are On The Fastest Available Route. **Contingency:** Contingency is the first video on the universe timeline. Set during the late 1960s, the Cold War was hot and heavy. At 3:00 AM, Local 58 has reached the end of its broadcast day and wishes its viewers a good night. Then, as a picture of an astronaut on the moon is shown, a message pops up. Now I want to take a pause for a minute. Later on in the series it seems that every time a moon is shown in Local58, it is the result of the manipulators (as I will call them). Any cut away from that footage indicates that the humans have taken control of the broadcast. This is very important as it adds evidence to what I believe about this video. A message is shown stating that the United States has completely surrendered to insurmountable enemy forces. What these enemy forces are is not explicitly shown. A whole bunch of messages are then displayed, but I'll just highlight the ones I find important to this theory. ***""Though they may occupy our borders, our streets and our homes.... the enemy will never occupy our SPIRIT."" ""Now ALL AMERICANS - every man, woman, and child - are called upon to ACT before the moment passes by."" ""Use the method most available to you at this time.""*** Then there is some interference showing a blood fountain, some sort of black figurine, and then the broadcast comes back. ***""'Victory Position' Remember the 3 F's: Front Lawn, Face Up, Feet Together."" ""Infants and Pets: The smallest patriots."" ""The 51st state is not a place."" ""Local 58 'Hoax' Apology Card.""*** This video was excellent at setting the scene for the series. It was creepy, but it also stated a ton of information. Let's begin. Firstly, I am convinced that the ""enemy"" is not the Communists, I believe it is what I will refer to as ""the lunatics."" The lunatics are those who become crazy upon looking at the moon. These lunatics have already been converted in massive amounts and the government has noticed. They used to be regular people so obviously they would be out on the streets and entering people's homes, forcing them to look upon the moon. These loonies are everywhere. I believe that the American government truly released Contingency as a last resort to prevent more people to become lunatics. They know that it is impossible to fight against it, so they have surrendered to insurmountable forces, or rather, an immortal/all powerful force. They know that the only option other than becoming a lunatic is suicide. Obviously, they can't tell people to kill themselves because the moon is making people crazy. They would think the government was the crazy ones. So using the flame from the ongoing Cold War, they convince their citizens that the Communists have won, and in order to preserve America, citizens must kill themselves and their loved ones. And so, in a classic American move, the government tells people to lay down face-up, feet together, and die. This ""Victory Position"" is not a victory against the Communists or to preserve the American way of life. Rather, it is meant as a Victory against the moon, that it could not get another person to look upon it. **Show For Children:** It's 4:15 in the morning when this video takes place. 4:15... for a show for children. The title for this wonderfully created animation is ""A Grave Mistake"" with the main character named ""Cadavre."" I'd like to point out the difference between a corpse and a cadaver. A cadaver is a corpse that is used for medical research or education. We are shown Cadavre walking through a graveyard while the moon looks intently at him, smiling, waiting for the moment Cadavre looks at him. Cadavre finds an open pit and looks inside, only to find a mangled skeleton. It's eyes are still intact, contrary to later when we see Cadavre's skeleton in his own grave. I think that this skeleton as well as the bird/fetus later on are lunatics. These things are still alive as the presence of eyes indicate that they are not dead. Also the bird fetus still crows, so I mean, come on. I say bird fetus because it does appear to be a bird head combined with the body of a curled up fetus. Cadavre bolts after seeing the bird fetus, but we also see a quick shot of the mangled corpse earlier for a split second, indicating that these two are related. Now though, the moon is no longer smiling, but staring. He is starting to get irritated I think, and is moving closer and closer to Cadavre. He is now in front of the trees as Cadavre walks, indicating that he is in fact getting closer. His face is strained, trying to smile, as Cadavre has still not looked at him. Cadavre then finds a cave and descends until he finds a lone grave that he climbs into. He assumes the Victory Position, and closes his eyes in silent content. The moon inches towards the grave only to find a dead Cadavre. Now there is a lot to unpack in this video, but nothing that wasn't introduced in Contingency. First of all, the time. 4:15 AM is not a time when children would be watching television. So obviously, this is a show for adults. This theme of duplicity is meant throughout the video. You see, there is a constant battle for control of the station every time something related to the moon is shown. The government tries to send a message and the manipulators block it, or alter it. So the government tries to broadcast the same message from Contingency, which is for American citizens to commit suicide in the Victory Position. This also reminds me of how a lot of parents are always upset when a cartoon is very adult in nature even though the cartoon never said it was for children. People automatically associate cartoons to innocent entertainment and I think the government used this to their advantage to dupe the manipulators. If it is true that the corpses Cadavre stumbles upon are lunatics, then the government is showing what happens if people do not do what Cadavre did. Cadavre represents the American citizen, a human corpse getting ready to commit suicide. Suicide is of course represented by Cadavre's search for his own grave and then him using said grave. True to his name, Cadavre is a corpse that is shown to us, the viewer, for educational purposes. Follow the example of Cadavre: commit suicide in the Victory Position or suffer under the moon's influence. **Skywatching:** My theory relies greatly on the belief that the moon is not out to directly kill people, but rather to make them its minions. All evidence for this comes almost exclusively from this video. It's 12:00 AM. Midnight. The time when the moon is at its acme. Scheduled is Skywatching which seems to have originally been an astronomy documentary of some sort hosted by a man named Hank Heidemann. Suddenly, it's hijacked by a third party, the manipulators. The manipulator, who I will just shorten to man, starts off by zooming in on Orion's Belt and Pleiades. There is, surprisingly, a reason for these two constellations. Then, the man zooms in on the moon, or rather, his throne, as the man calls it. Then he really zooms in on it. The surface of the moon could be clearly seen on camera. This footage was (in-universe) taken in the 1990s. No camera could zoom in that closely to the moon. Obviously the moon has either grown or come closer to the man. With our closer view we can see craters and thus, part of the ground below the surface. There appears to be webs of some sort all over the moon, and to anyone who has been or seen a massive burn victim, it looks a lot like the region below the skin. It appears as though the moon is being stretched almost as if it is organic. Starting at 2:40 on the video, we see clouds from the moon's atmosphere being sucked into a specific crater. There is something very wrong with that sentence. There are no clouds or atmosphere on our moon. So what are they? And who's inhaling it? Then we see the most confusing thing this series has yet offered. At 3:07 we see what appears to be a walled settlement of some kind and a pit in the shape of an arrow. The moon disappears for a few and then re-emerges, brighter and larger than ever. It isn't until the man lowers the brightness and we can clearly see the moon that it seems to take effect. The man goes in front of the camera and seems to praise it as the text comes up stating ""Rejoice."" It looks like a quarter of the moon has broken off revealing fibers from inside. Not much comes from this video to be honest, we leave with more questions than answers. What exactly was that triangle pit? Who uses the moon as his throne? Who is this man? Well this is what we do get out of this video. The moon has followers, minions, worshipers. It does not kill people who look at it, but rather makes them crazy. The lunatics fit into a long time myth that those who look at the moon become crazy, hence why we call crazy people luna-tics. In fact, I think that myth is what this whole channel is about. I want to go back to Orion's Belt and Pleiades. This part is strange as it indicates that the man does not know exactly where the moon is. You see, the man uses Orion's Belt and Pleiades as a map. Orion's Belt is commonly used by astronomers to locate Pleiades in the night sky. Pleiades and the moon are near each other every month when it is a full moon. This man is using Pleiades as a way to locate the full moon. And he finds it. But this really begs the question. Why can't he just find the moon? Well later on we see that the moon does disappear from sight despite directly looking at it. So the moon can decide when it wants to appear. Interesting. It can move on its own and alter its visibility. I believe that the moon only affects people when it is a full moon. The man using Pleiades hoping to find the moon indicates that he is in fact looking for a full moon. Also, we see that this channel spans decades, so if the moon was making people crazy every night, I don't think humanity would last a few years and manipulators have talked about the light from the moon influencing them. Using this information, we now know that all videos within Local58 occur during a full moon. In Contingency, the message ""The 51st state is not a place"" pops up. When the United States first landed on the moon, they jokingly called it the 51st state. Taken literally, the message is saying that the moon is not a place. It's not a location, not somewhere. Perhaps instead of being a somewhere, its a something. People believe that the use of His Throne is a reference to the moon, but with all the astronomy placements, it is common to label an astrological object as being on a seat or throne. It means more of its placement rather than itself. **Real Sleep:** At this stage of Local58, there is no clear indicator of the order of the remaining videos, but I have ordered them in a way that makes sense story-wise. Its 3:00 PM. Real Sleep is scheduled to play. Hmm... 3:00 PM. It opens with a message stating that ***""This video cassette is non-transferable. It is intended solely for the personal use of Gerhardt, Philip ID 750117.""*** That's strange. What is a personal cassette tape doing in a public television broadcast? Even more confusing is that this tape was made in 1983. Using the logos from A Look Back we can clearly see that this video is set in the 2000-2010s. Philip Gerhardt appears to be some sort of test subject or patient in a facility controlled by the Thought Research Initiative. The video then prompts with a series of questions that we must figure out to be either myth or fact. The first question is ***""Dreaming is necessary for regular sleep function,""*** which turns out to be a myth. ***""Dreams contain symbolism that can predict the future,""*** which also turns out to be myth. It adds to this by saying ""***Precognition is a lie.""*** ***""Sleep allows the body and mind to heal and recover,""*** this time being a fact. The video then introduces us to the Kleitman map. Nathaniel Kleitman was a scientist who studied REM sleep, or Rapid Eye Movement. He is considered the father of sleep research. I could not find, however, anything about a Kleitman map on the internet. The video states that a Kleitman map of the brain can trigger dream stimuli and that the inverse of said map could create an opposite effect. The next section is titled ""Inducing Your Anti-Dream."" I want to point out the wording for this. Inducing implies we are persuading our Anti-Dream to come out. Anti-Dream is used, which is strange. Anti-Dreams would most closely associate with nightmares, not no dream. After all the opposite of 1 is not 0, but -1. And I think this is where the Thought Research Initiative gets their hypothesis wrong. They believe that by conducting the inverse of the Kleitman map which supposedly stimulates dreams they will eliminate the dream, but in reality it would only impose nightmares as we see later on. I'm still in the summary phase, but I'm splitting it up because I don't want a large text blob. This last section is split into parts. First we have Visual Calibration. Stare directly at the center of your television. We are then shown a group of faces and end with an upset face. This being a recorded video and not live, it is easy to assume that this is for Philip to get used to the faces, however, I believe that the television is in fact monitoring Philip's reaction to the faces and holding onto the face that seems to upset him, or scare him, the most. Next we have cortical memory, which shows us two sets of faces, one red and the other green. It then puts them together and make them disappear. This stage is meant to make the viewer see faces in places where they don't exist, as we can still see the shadow of the face in the new background. Next we have the ablation of subconscious. Ablation is the surgical removal of body tissue. We are then told to recite ""There are no faces"" as we are shown a set of distorted faces that resemble the upset face we saw in the visual calibration section. Notice how when looking upon the faces, they are etched somewhat in our vision, creating shadows that appear where there are no faces. Then the final sequence, Acceptance. Read each phrase without reading. It then shows multiple messages attacking the idea of sleep. At the end, the face is still in the background, but is so light that it is hard to see, almost as if it isn't there, but we still see it. It then closes off with if there were any problems, consult a technician, not a doctor. This is a very important video for the series as it marks a major turning point in Local 58 as a television broadcast channel. First, let's consider what this video is trying to do. I believe that this video was part of a failed experiment by the Thought Research Initiative to create dreamless sleep. However, it messed up in relying on the inverse of the Kleitman map. The Kleitman map is fictional to the universe, so it could really be anything, but it does appear that it stimulates dreams. Perhaps relying on the inverse stimulates nightmares. The Thought Research Initiative then creates a video to send to subjects that can calibrate to each viewer on the spot using their television to sync with their Kleitman map. The video, whether intentional or not, causes the viewer to see faces everywhere around them, eventually making them repeat the same phrase, ""There are no faces,"" in an attempt to make themselves less scared. At the end of the day, the viewer cannot sleep as they are surrounded by the horrifying image of distorted faces around them. Now that we have the result of the video, let's consider what it's doing on public television. I believe that Philip Gerhardt, or someone who knows him, put the VHS into the broadcast manually. They infiltrated the station or perhaps already worked there and created a time slot where they physically put in the VHS for broadcast. Perhaps he became a lunatic hoping to convert more people. He put this on at 3:00 PM where he knew most people were still awake in order to get the most viewership. All viewers would hopefully be so scarred that they would be unable to sleep at night. Then, come night, the full moon rises and unable to rest the unlucky viewers of Real Sleep would walk around their house and look upon the moon, whether directly or through their mirrors. This is the most interesting thing though. Unlike previous manipulator attempts, this wasn't so direct. People would watch this rather than look away uncomfortably. You know who would watch it without worry? Local 58. Many workers would be watching the broadcast at the station to make sure that no interference was made and would obviously get the effects of the video. This is the major turning point. Local 58 workers can't sleep that night and thus become lunatics. Local 58 at this point on is run by the lunatics. **Weather Service:** It's 1:00 AM. Paid Programming is scheduled. We know this from events on ""You Are On The Fastest Available Route."" This is the first time that we are introduced to paid programming. For those of you who don't know, paid programming is basically 30 minute long infomercials aimed at selling a product. We are then interrupted by an Emergency Alert Broadcast issued by the county for a weather warning. Images of the moon interrupt throughout the broadcast. A message then states that there is a meteorological event and for everyone to remain indoors until sunrise tomorrow morning. Because of prior videos, we know that this meteorological event is the full moon. The broadcast is then interrupted by Local 58 itself that then states that 2:15 has been scheduled for Blood of the... Then the broadcast comes back up this time with a red background. This time rather than a Weather Warning, it is a Civil Danger Alert. It states that there is more information to follow. This isn't pre-made, this warning is happening on the spot, and it's something they weren't prepared for. Don't look at the night sky. Then it swaps, the meteorological event is deemed safe to view. The warning has been lifted. There is clearly some conflict between the officials and the manipulators. However, I don't believe it's the usual manipulators this time. Previously, the manipulators seemed to always have pre-made interruptions or at least had clean cuts. They were well planned. This time though, everything is happening on the spot. There is obvious conflict happening throughout the county. Action is happening. The manipulators are typing their messages, not just showing them. They typed the warning has been lifted, and they also typed go outside now. The manipulators have never typed before. This isn't some cut to their own videos, they are editing the actual broadcast themselves. They have access to the actual footage, not their own. The broadcast cuts out and we are shown the Local 58 logo. Then another message from the County Weather Service. No more cuts. No more fighting for control. But this isn't coming from the CWS. No. Black has been crudely drawn over the blue background that would show the message from the CWS. What we see next is coming from a manipulator. The light from the full moon got to him and now he wants to show it to us too. This was an amazing video. It was incredibly action packed yet only consisted of words. First, I want to talk about this new aspect of Local 58, paid programming. Paid programming is a very important part from this point on as it is also interrupted in YAOTFAR. The interesting thing is what this implies. As we saw in Real Sleep, Local 58 has become controlled by the lunatics and this only reinforces that theory. They set up a specific time slot for paid programming to advertise the moon. That is their infomercial. The channel is directly advertising the moon. This video marks the moment when the government lost control. The moon has everything set up, the local stations are under its control and through them they have access to the people. It took decades of constant battles with the American government and Local 58. It tried with Skywatching, but that didn't get its message across. It needed a way to guarantee people looking at the moon. And it did that through infiltrating Local 58 and showing Real Sleep. Now its final obstacle was the government. The government knew what was happening, they knew that the moon was getting the upper hand with Local 58 so they decided to wait no more. They couldn't do a move like Contingency, people weren't willing to die for their country anymore. So they released an emergency broadcast warning people. But to their horror, it failed. **You Are On The Fastest Available Route:** It's 1:55 AM. Paid Programming is scheduled. Paid Programming is then deleted, and we are shown a live dashcam video. It shows a driver following instructions from a GPS on a rainy night. The GPS claims that his destination is 2 hours and 28 minutes. It is exactly 1:58, let's see if that's true. There's just a lot of directions and driving at first, but the first strange thing to happen happens at the 1:20 mark. Instead of saying ""You are on the fastest available route,"" the GPS just says "" You are on the fastest route."" I think this is the point where the GPS is hijacked. By getting rid of the word available, the GPS is implying that there are multiple fastest routes. That's impossible for a car as there is usually only one fastest route, but for a person or thing, it can use as many routes as it wants. Again, at the 1:45 mark the GPS pauses after saying ""You will arrive at your destination in 14... minute."" It hesitates as it tries to calibrate where the destination is because, as we see later, it moves. At 2:05, the GPS says ""make a U-turn."" The destination has went from in front of him to behind him. In other words, the thing is circling his car. At 2:18, the GPS says the infamous line, ""follow signs for Do Not Enter."" Seeing as our driver is not in a park or state reserve, this can only mean he is entering private property. This also is evident by the fact that it is an unnamed road. And finally, the GPS tells the driver to turn off their headlights. Why the driver complies I have no idea. Then we hear distortion and as the driver turns on his headlights, we see a quick shot of a tall white creature in front of him. As the driver drives off, the GPS constantly says the destination is behind him and despite him running away, the destination gets closer and closer. We close at a shot of a destroyed car and the GPS stating that we have arrived. And so it has begun. The moon has begun its attack on the Earth. It's army is huge as it has gained followers throughout the decades. By manipulating our devices, the moon is capable of directing people to secluded areas where lunatics will capture or kill them. The white creature resembles the mangled corpse in A Show For Children. Somehow, these lunatics and perhaps the moon itself can manipulate satellite signals as they can manipulate both broadcasts and GPS. One thing is for certain though, You Are On The Fastest Available Route is the start of the moon's invasion. **Summary:** In the late 1960s the American government became aware of a paranormal event where upon those looking at a full moon would become crazy, eventually becoming dangerous individuals. Using the heat of the Cold War, they broadcast a message calling for the suicide of all American citizens. They also urged citizens to assume the Victory Position in order to spite the moon. This broadcast, however, was played off as a hoax by Local 58 and those who had not killed themselves already would remain at risk of the moon. In another attempt, the American government creates a cartoon disguised as a children's show to go under the manipulator's radar. This works as no interference is made, however few get the point and thus few commit suicide. A few years later a manipulator takes control of an astronomy documentary to show viewers a video of the full moon as well as its surface. We see a formation on the moon that is yet unknown, however it does resemble a walled settlement. The moon comes closer to the man and eventually causes the man to praise it. From this we know that the moon is mobile, can alter its visibility, and is possibly a throne to an all-powerful being. Then in the 2000s, a lunatic infiltrates Local 58 to show a video that is intended to keep the viewer from sleeping. He does this in the afternoon to reach as many viewers as possible. This works and even affects the Local 58 staff. With the sudden increase of lunatics, the government is again made aware of the paranormal phenomenon and attempt to sound a warning. Due to no longer being able to use the Cold War as a reason, they use the guise of a meteorological event to dissuade people from looking at the moon. This broadcast, however, fails as Local 58 directly alters it eventually convincing everyone that it is safe to go outside. With full control of the people of Mason County, the moon converts all lunatics into tall white creatures to hunt down all non-lunatics. The moon uses its power over satellites to mess with GPS and brings unsuspecting victims over to its minions. Whether the all-powerful being in the moon has escaped, we do not know. But all that is certain is that he now rules over Mason County. Rejoice. &#x200B; \-PheonicksRisingDown &#x200B; Hey reader, this took me a really long time to research and write so I hope you enjoy it.

732,"[MANGA SPOILERS] [NEW CHAPTER SPOILERS] How will at all go down? Will Isayama keep his original dark ending? Here’s my somewhat broad but probable theory addressing the major plot progression points we’ll see in this arc and its bittersweet conclusion. TLDR included.Skip forward to the section labeled as “ENDGAME THEORY” to skip optional preliminary/supporting evidence sections. PRELIMINARY (optional): This link further builds upon an analysis of Eren's character following the chapter where we first see him begin his most recent titanization prior to the rumbling. It's not necessary to read it to understand this post, but since I didn't go into great detail with Eren's portion in this write up, it may be worth reading to better understand where I'm coming from with this endgame prediction. Link below: https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/dx6rp9/manga_spoilers_as_the_story_begins_to_wrap_up/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf Continue on to section labeled “ENDGAME THEORY” to skip. (This paragraph is optional where I just explain my own history with the story) PRELIMINARY (optional): I've loved this story since the first episode of the anime gripped me and I went on to read the manga starting where the show left off. At the time, it was around the end of the RTS arc and I hated that I hate to wait month to month for the story. Eventually, I began to fill the time with discussion in the subreddit and deeper and deeper analysis of certain thematic aspects/character motivations and found this to be the part of the story that I enjoyed focusing on most. The action scenes are great, and second to few other shows, but the character depths and underlying thematic past experiences and driving emotions that influenced their decision-making is where the show really sets itself apart imo. As a result, I dove deep into attempting to understand and clarify the subtext and felt that I began to understand the thematic substructure and character personalities of the story on a level that enriched the story dramatically for me. So basically, since the RTS arc, I've been spending waaay too much time reading into the story since I had all that extra time on my hands between chapters and I couldn't stop thinking about this great show. It's led to some accurate and inaccurate predictions and some great and some not-great-whatsoever theories and character breakdowns. Those I feel I understand best are Eren, Reiner, Armin, Christa and Connie. Even when the plot takes a huge twist detour, predictions can be fairly accurate still when it comes to predicting how these few characters will react to situations and drive the story progression. Usually I don't focus in on what seems like the logical next step in the plot as much as I insert defining themes established from the past for a certain charter and assume the character in question will act in a similar manner as before or in a manner that shows growth/decline from a previous encounter that revealed their personality and a moment of struggle/sacrifice. .......... .......... ENDGAME THEORY (TLDR below) .......... That said, I think we can fairly broadly but accurately predict the ending by using what we already know about certain people. Rapid-fire preestablished thematic/consistent points to consider are these: (broken down by character) <<Eren>> Eren wants to rid the world of titans at any cost. He values his friends above all else (see the railroad sunset scene) and will do terrible things on their behalf for their betterment, despite collateral damage (see grim reminder 2.0, his civilian casualty count from the climatic season 1 fight with Annie's Titan in the city, and his killing of the slave traders to save Mikasa). Eren loves freedom, but hates more those that take it away from innocent others; Eren calls those that do such ""monsters"" that lack humanity, and he slaughters such people wholesale-especially if they interfere with people he cares for. Also recall the line so often repeated since season one, ""to fight/rise above monsters, one must abandon their humanity."" These are Eren's ""offerings of reckless courage"" which are referenced in the season one OP song. (Optional- Read the post linked at the top of this one to get a simple yet comprehensive breakdown of Eren’s most important character traits/trends as well as how these contributed to foreshadowing across the plot’s progression and why it will ultimately matter and influence this final arc) <<Mikasa>> Mikasa and Eren still need resolution and ever since his future-vision following the RTS arc, Eren probably feels that he is at least somewhat responsible for Mikasa's lack of personality and non-existent self-determination which he considers has its root cause in the ackerbond slave relationship they have. The final arc will likely culminate in Mikasa taking Armin's advice from the previous chapter to ""make decisions for herself for once."" In doing so, she will likely choose to metaphorically ""leave behind Eren's scarf"" and take independent actions that will be contrary (possibly lethal) to Eren's interests. This has been foreshadowed by her recent re-evalution of her memories of Eren and the scene where she left the scarf on the table several chapters ago. Eren has been wanting her to be independent of the slave-bond for two reasons: He wants to know that her relationship to him is voluntary, not coerced- which is why he asks her ""who am I to you?"" in a recent chapter. More importantly, he knows that her blind protectivism of him will get her killed by his rumbling plans if the ackerbond is not weakened/severed- which is why he was so strangely cruel at the meeting where he said that he always hated her (and probably himself too) for her being a slave. <<Reiner>> Reiner has been brainwashed into oblivion, but there is one broad personality trait that transcends his split personality; in both warrior and soldier mindset, he desperately wants to be well-liked, adopts the leadership/big brother role and WANTS TO BE A HERO more than anything else. All of this comes from his traumatic childhood where his father abandoned him and his unloving mother used him for strictly personal benefit. Reiner also cares deeply for his loved ones (such as the cadet kids and fellow warriors) and will gladly sacrifice himself for them if it means redeeming them.. (seen by moments where he got up after the grim reminder 2.0 explosion to save Porco, sacrificial offering of his nape to Falco for just before the titanized Falco inherited the jaw powers, intervention to save Connie in castle Utgard just before the rolled the cannon down the stairs- all these and more point to him being willing to sacrifice his own wellbeing for that of another.) Lastly, recall that flashback when Reiner first arrived at the shiganshina wall and busted the interior gate. His line was something expressing his desperation at not having things end yet where he still knew nothing and hadn't accomplished anything. Before he gives it all up, either by suicide, self-sacrifice, or battle injury, Reiner is desperate to have made a difference first and would prefer to be viewed as a Hero. This strongly foreshadows him as the new Helos. <<Armin>> Armin has always harbored insecurities about his abilities. His hesitation is a direct product of this and has often led to underperformance/harm being done to allies when he gave into it. An example of the many such times this recurring theme was highlighted was exhibited when he was put in charge during the beginning of the RTS arc where they searched the walls and also at the ensuing battle's midpoint where his plan to try negotiation with Bert resulted in Hange and company being blown away which directly contributed (at least in his mind) to Bert shifting and catching fire to the town. Here he want into a shell-shocked, frozen, panic and had to ask Jean to step in to make decisions. This insecurity is further amplified following the RTS arc by the fact that he was chosen as a wildcard over the safe, reliable, and seemingly obvious choice of Erwin. This theme echoes in the previous chapter where we see him again question his own ability and crack under the stress of the moment as well as compared himself to Erwin. Here he says that Erwin would have known what to do and he admits out loud that he should not have been chosen. Floch in serumbowl says that ""only a Devil"" was possibly capable of taking the necessary steps to lead the military and achieve victory. Remember also that Armin's character arc has led him on a progression of slowly falling from his ideals and embracing the necessities of devilish decisions where the ends justify the means- an ideology that he would never have held in the early chapters where he wouldn't even hit a bully back as a kid bc he was so adverse to resolving conflicts in this way saying something to the effect that acting so would cause him to ""lose."" Armin has since necessarily bent these lofty ideals in certain instances such as when he shot and killed the MP soldier that was about to kill Jean in the uprising arc and when he detonated his Titan bomb in the Marley harbor. We will see a payoff for this thematic groundwork where I believe Armin will again be called to save the day by difficult decision making and sacrifice of old ideals, but he ultimately will be reluctantly-willing and capable of playing a critical and uniquely-arminesque role in the final conflict. (""Song for the reluctant heroes"" intensities) This will solidify him as the proper and ""singularly-correct"" serumbowl choice and finally put an end to his competency self-doubts as he chooses a dark decision where the end justify the costly/painful means. Also recall that Armin’s voice actor narrates the beginning, and I think this is an indication that he will survive to tell the story of “The Legend Eren Yeager and Reiner Braun The Hero” (more on this below). <<TLDR>> So, with all this supporting evidence referenced, I feel that a safe bet for the resolution to this final arc is this... Isayama will give us a bittersweet ending still, though it will have a silver lining and not be as dark a conclusion as he had originally planned. Armin will devise a personally-difficult-to-execute plan. A plan that only Armin (not Erwin) could have pulled of due to personal connection with or memories of Eren and Eren will ultimately be fatally brought down by it. In the process, Eren will somehow cause the eradication of titanization ability- possibly by leaving the Paths realm vacant of a sand sculptor or by altering all Eldians just before his death from the sandy Path realm. The mysterious ice-burst stone plane will allow a certain one or a few of our characters to catch up to Eren by following the trail of destruction left in his wake. Here, some combination of Reiner/Armin/Mikasa will result in Eren being stopped. This circumstance is dependent upon the previous relationship building and trust established with Reiner during his 5 years undercover as a scout. Without this understanding between the characters, success would likely be impossible as only this uniquely rare path would combine to produce this scenario where Reiner (with relationship to EMA and a Hero complex), Armin (with Erwinesque Devil-like decision-making capabilities via insecurity and personal suspension of his ideals), and Mikasa (with a broken ackerbond resulting in independence of thought and a diminished protection impulse for Eren). Reiner will die a sacrificial death in the ensuing conflict. His death however will be worth it and satisfying since the story told to the public will embellish the historical details (a preestablished theme of the Helos myth which will return here) and represent Reiner as the eldian Hero that saved the world- resulting in a peace between paradis and the word and the establishment of the new age's Helos legend. Meanwhile, I predict that Eren has acted intentionally and precisely every step of the way following his ""historia hand kiss future memory vision"" in order to bring about and cause this specific path to come to pass. It is possible that this story has been in a timeloop of countless iterations of failure before this singularly unique path finally managed to be expressed into reality through trial and error and a continual resetting of the 2000year age of the titans. Finally, after so many attempts at achieving this path's ultimately-expressed reality the attack Titan with Eren will finally be able to break the cycle and regain its freedom. I also wouldn’t be surprised if this was all done for Eren’s soon-to-be-born child with historia that he saw through future memory paths. This narration given by Armin could be his retelling of Eren’s story to Eren’s child since Eren’s self-sacrifice may have been the only way/path for him to bring his child into a world that is free from titans and free to continue on into the future rather than looping infinitely to repeat the past. Considering Isayama's attention to detail and the reprisal of previously established themes as well as what we know of the motivations and habits of these key characters, I think we can assume that something similar to what I've touched on here will be how the story progresses from here and bittersweetly concludes.",
733,"The insane time commitment for children - wtf.TLDR at the the bottom. \------------------------ I was having a conversation with my partner a little while ago about the sheer time commitment that's involved in being 'in good standing' as a Witness. When I sat down to break down the amount of time spent for anyone; let alone for a child, is staggering. To give you guys a breakdown, here's what **ONE week** as a witness child looked like for me once I was able to read: * Weekday meeting: 2 hours (This was before it was shortened) * Bookstudy: 1 hour (plus the time spent getting our house ready since it happened in our home) * Family study: 1 hour * Sunday meeting: 2 hours * Personal study for all 3 meetings: 2-3 hours * Personal Bible reading: .5 hours * Personal reading (magazines, yearbook, etc.): 2 hours * Saturday Service: 2.5 hours **BONUS:** I joined the school was I was 9, so I got talks every other month or so, so that was a bonus 3+ hours a month when I was given one. \------------------------ That's **a minimum of 13 hours a week.** What the *actual* fuck. That's too much for me (a grown ass adult) to do after work. Are you kidding?? Then add on school (37.5 hours), plus homework (10-12 hours), plus you know, having to eat, sleep, bathe, and the chores I had to do. If I didn't do all of these required Witness things every single week, I would get grounded, not be allowed to spend time with friends, watch tv or play video games (and as a kid who wasn't allowed in any extra curricular activities, those things were my lifeline). \------------------------ I understand that the intention behind the inordinate amount of time spent is to make it so that way you don't have time to think about how much it doesn't make sense. I had BIG questions as young as 8 that I wasn't allowed to ask, and was frankly too exhausted to think about. I know it's not a helpful thought to ponder, but I do wonder what my life would have been like if I could have spent the extra 50+ hours a month on something I was passionate about... \------------------------ Looking at it now, it's no wonder I was suicidal by age 12. I was a child, had zero tools to deal with life, and was given nothing but mindless busy work, paired with the reasons I was going to be killed by god. I honestly forgot (repressed?) how much time I had to spend every week just to not be looked at with disdain by those around me, or be labelled as 'bad association'. I was raised by some über dubs in this, so I'm sure there's some variety for some others who were born in. But this was expected of me every. single. week. Was this experience similar or reminiscent of your own? \------------------------ TLDR; Raised as a witness, once I learned to read (age 7+), my average week was 13 hours spent on theocratic activities. Wtf. Was this experience similar to yours?",
734,"Eight Years Sober Today (Progress Pics and My Story)http://silverladder.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/8YearsSober.jpg Yes, that first one is a mugshot courtesy of the Maricopa County Detention Department. I hope this can encourage someone out there who may be struggling and wondering if they can get sober. If I can do it, I genuinely believe anyone can. Here's my full story. Hopefully it can help someone as well. I'm pasting it here because I seem to recall that when I tried to paste the link to the story on my blog a couple years ago, my post got deleted. I hope it's ok that I included the link to my pic (the subreddit wouldn't let me make an image post). I was awakened by the sound of someone screaming. I couldn’t make out the words, but I didn’t need to. The sound was unnerving enough without knowing what was being said. As I opened my eyes and adjusted to my surroundings, I was reminded once again where I was: jail. Suddenly, the sights, sounds, and yes, smells, came flooding back in to my head. With them came the cold reality of where I was, who I had become, and where my life had ended up. If being regularly jolted awake by the tormented screams of inmates in neighboring cells wasn’t bad enough, there was the fact that I was sharing a cell designed for a single inmate with three other people. We were crowded four deep in a tiny cell, and there was no escaping the smell. To call it unpleasant would be putting it lightly. It was overpowering. As my eyes adjusted to the light, I looked at the bottom of the bunk above me. On it was a hurricane of words… angry, unstable words, scratched into the metal bed frame by those who had been there before me. The words sounded a lot like the things that many of the people around me uttered every day. This was an insane place, and for the time being, it was home. In that moment, my mind jumped back once again to the decisions that had brought me here, and the people who had been hurt because of my choices. I said to myself, “You had so many loving people in your life, but this time you’ve lost them. You had every good thing that anyone could ask for, and you threw it all away because of your actions.” I thought about the person I had become and the downward spiral I had traveled for so long. I thought to myself, “How did I get here?” I got started down the road to substance abuse in middle school for a few reasons. I was a scared, awkward kid who desperately wanted to be liked, but didn’t quite fit the mold that everyone else was in. I was definitely different, and not always in a way that was seen as good. I wasn’t even remotely comfortable in my own skin. So I thought I’d win my peers’ approval and acceptance by drinking. In addition to that, I was curious to see what it was like. Finally, there were some people I looked up to who had substance abuse issues of their own, and they seemed completely happy and successful. So, while I had been told about the dangers of drugs and alcohol, what I had seen conveyed a very different message. The first time I drank, one of the worst things that could have possibly happened did happen: nothing. I don’t mean that the alcohol didn’t affect me. I mean that there weren’t any immediate consequences, at least that I could notice. After having been told what drugs and alcohol would do to me, I was anticipating some kind of instant lightning bolt of consequence. When nothing seemed to go wrong, I thought, “There’s no price to pay for this. I just did it and I’m fine. The world didn’t end. They lied to me about this.” I’ve since learned something very important about consequences. There is a consequence for every negative or unhealthy decision we make, but they don’t always happen immediately and we don’t always notice them right away. Sometimes they don’t become apparent until much later, and sometimes they chase you down the road years later. I noticed that when I drank, everything seemed to get better. My pain seemed to go away. I was dealing with bullying and feeling very out of place in junior high, and when I drank, I quit feeling the sadness from that. It seemed to allow me to finally be comfortable in my own skin. I didn’t realize that the feeling was a lie. When I got into high school, alcohol was a lot easier to get, and I started using it as a way to deal with my problems. My alcohol use became much more frequent and I started drinking larger quantities. I didn’t realize how much worse I was making things for myself. None of it seemed like a big deal at the time. Alcohol then gave way to marijuana, nitrous oxide (Whip-Its), and some initial experimentation with prescription drugs. By the time I was a freshman in college, I was using marijuana daily and drinking frequently. Later in college I got caught in the web of opiate painkillers after a friend with a prescription gave me some oxycodone. After I started on painkillers, the floodgates opened. The feeling from opiates was a step beyond alcohol in my quest to escape my pain, disintegrating relationship, and my growing dislike for myself. Somehow I miraculously made it through college with a decent GPA and managed to get my degree. I’m still not completely sure how I managed that. Shortly after college, I got into ecstasy and cocaine. I developed a huge cocaine habit that eventually led me to getting into meth, once the cocaine ceased being effective. Right around the same time, my painkiller addiction led to heroin after it became impossible to get legitimate prescriptions and expensive to buy illicit opiate pharmaceuticals. Alcohol was there all along, in ridiculously excessive quantities. Eventually, I became willing to use just about any substance that happened to cross my path. When someone asked what my drug of choice was, I laughingly quoted the Alice in Chains song “Junkhead.” “What’s my drug of choice? Well, what have you got?” My life was a mess. I lost jobs due to absenteeism, quit other jobs due to an inability to focus, and eventually stopped trying to get jobs. I drained a $10,000 bank account on my addiction. I had nothing to show for it but increasing health problems. There was alcohol poisoning. There were overdoses. There was one particular overdose involving a combination of cocaine, meth, alcohol, and fentanyl (a powerful synthetic opioid) that was absolutely hellish and insane. To this day, it surprises me that I made it through that one. My behavior was erratic and I became angry and unpredictable. At one point, coke and meth made me a 130lb skeleton. At a later point, alcohol made me a 215lb slug. This went on for years. I lost my 20’s and the better part of my 30’s. I wanted to stop but was so caught up in it all. I was making all kinds of bad decisions. I’m responsible for my own choices, but addiction and the damaged thinking that comes with it makes it a whole lot easier to make bad choices. Eventually I was no longer using to feel good, but to not feel horrible. I was drinking and using purely out of addiction and the need to avoid withdrawal. Guilt and shame kept me running back to drugs and alcohol, which led to behavior that caused me guilt and shame. It was an endless cycle. I ended up jobless for a long time, and thousands of dollars in debt. My thinking and brain chemistry were so overwhelmed by the substances to which I was a slave. I came to a point where I hated myself and said, “I’m never coming back from this. I’ve done too much damage. I’m going to ride this train until it crashes.” The last night I drank and used, I went on a rampage. I hurt people who didn’t deserve it, smashed up my own house, and eventually attempted to end my own life. I was arrested and charged with multiple felonies. If I had been convicted of everything I was charged with, I was looking at the possibility of a doing few years in the Arizona Department of Corrections. That’s what led to me serving time in Durango Jail, part of Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s notorious Maricopa County Jail system. While in jail, I went through hellish withdrawals. The extent of the jail’s acknowledgement of my withdrawal consisted of giving me a bottom bunk, so I would be less likely to get a concussion if my withdrawals led to a seizure that ended up with me falling out of bed. I suffered horrible insomnia and only managed to occasionally sleep for about 15 minutes at a time. It was less like sleeping and more like passing out. I genuinely felt like I was going insane. I went through a combination of the worst physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual pain I’ve ever felt. I genuinely believed that I had lost everyone and everything I loved and cared about. I found myself at a nearly unbearable low point. I became willing to do anything to repair the damage I had done, but wasn’t sure that such repair would even be possible. While in the midst of this, I somehow found a tiny bit of sanity, which allowed me to make myself a promise to make my faith, my family, and my sobriety my priorities. A fellow inmate named Troy gave me a Bible, which I started reading. It was a welcome escape and was the only thing that gave me any kind of hope in those moments. I latched on to that Higher Power and never let go. I eventually bailed out while my case was pending, and I moved into a place called the Phoenix Dream Center. It’s a live-in facility where people who have had substance abuse issues, people who have been in jail and prison, people who have been homeless, former gang members, and victims of human trafficking can move in and get their lives back together. A lot of good growth and healing started for me there, but it wasn’t easy. In a lot of ways, the Dream Center is harder than jail. Our days started at 4 a.m. and ended at 11 p.m. Every moment was scheduled for us and included intense morning workouts (run by a former pro rugby star), classes, janitorial work, maintenance work, labor, homeless outreach, church, etc. We were run ragged, but the discipline, structure, and purpose were what I (and the others there) needed as part of a successful recovery. While in the Dream Center, I poured myself back into my faith, which remains a key component of my recovery today. I started communicating again, instead of trying to run from my problems. I made exercise and nutrition a big part of my life. I started creating art and writing again. I started to laugh again. I gained back my self-respect and others’ trust. As a result of the changes that began there, I was able to restore my marriage; something I hoped would happen but didn’t know was possible. In court, the prosecutor was seeking 90 days of jail time for me, and the Probation Presentence Writer wanted me to do six months. I didn’t want either to happen, as they could delay the good work that had begun in my marriage, and in my growth as a person. I accepted a plea deal. Based on what I said and others said at my sentencing, the judge said that he didn’t see any benefit to me serving additional time. To this day, I am grateful he listened to me and to the others who spoke. I was sentenced to two years supervised probation. I was assigned 46 weeks of one type of counseling and 15 weeks of another. I was given a permanent (“designated”) felony and lost my rights as an American citizen. I paid thousands of dollars in court fines and fees. I was given a 10 p.m. curfew. I was randomly drug tested. Under really interesting circumstances, I ran into a guy who overheard part of my story and told me I should apply to be a substance abuse Peer Educator at a local prevention nonprofit called notMYkid. I did. In January of 2013, I started there as a part-time youth Peer Educator and worked as hard as I could. I spoke in schools across Arizona, sharing the experience and knowledge I learned during my journey with students in 6th through 12th grade. I decided to be as open and honest as I could about my past in order to help prevent others from taking the same path. I did everything I was asked to do and took on additional duties. I was relentless and determined in my efforts. Within the first three months, they made me full time. Four months later, I was given a staff position, and became the organization’s first Communications Coordinator. I was then promoted to Manager of Parent and Faculty Education for the organization and eventually became a Prevention Specialist. I research several behavioral health topics and create presentations for parents, school faculty members, after school program mentors, and camp counselors. I have also recruited, hired, trained, and managed several Parent and Faculty Educators, who are primarily behavioral health professionals and current or former law enforcement officers. I do student/youth presentations on substance abuse, bullying, and a combination topic of depression, self-injury, and suicide. I do parent and faculty presentations on substance abuse, bullying, depression/self-injury/suicide, and Internet safety. I also do TV, radio, web, and print interviews as the organization’s representative. I’ve done approximately 80 interviews in the last few years, including live TV appearances in New York, Boston, Dallas, Denver, and Kansas City. Those interviews have included the “Today” show, “Good Day New York,” “Kansas City Live,” NECN Boston, and WFAA Dallas. I currently travel around Arizona doing speaking engagements, sharing my personal story intertwined with teachable keys to behavioral health. I’ve had the opportunity to share my story with students and government officials in Boston, students and parents in California, and parents in Kansas City. I’ve spoken to groups as small as five people and as large as 1,000. I’ve done as many as seven one-hour presentations back-to-back. I’ve had the chance to address the Pinal County Drug Court, sharing my story and thoughts on the way government and the courts view addiction. I’ve presented at Grand Canyon University, Arizona State University, Paradise Valley Community College, and a number of corporations, Including American Express, Cox, Intel, and Insight. As of October 2019, I’ve done over 500 presentations to an audience of over 50,000 people at more than 200 different venues. Approximately half of my presentations have been given to youth, and the other half to adults. I also had the opportunity to do interviews for a historic documentary called “Hooked: Tracking Heroin’s Hold on Arizona,” which was simulcast on every TV station (and most radio stations) in Arizona on January 13th, 2015. Additionally, I was appointed to the Recovery and Response Subcommittee responsible for developing, staffing, and overseeing the crisis line phone bank taking calls during and after the airing of the documentary. I also served on the Recovery and Response Subcommittee tasked with overseeing the crisis line response for the sequel documentary called “Hooked Rx,” which aired in early 2017. In October of 2015, I had the chance to become an ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training) trainer. As a registered trainer, I now have the honor of facilitating two-day suicide intervention workshops, and teaching genuinely lifesaving intervention skills to people around the state of Arizona. It has allowed me to combine my personal experience with the topic, and my passion for helping others, with the well-designed material that has become the industry standard (crisis lines, military, fire departments, police departments) for suicide intervention. I have since used my experience and training to help multiple different people who were struggling with thoughts of suicide. The opportunity has been nothing short of a blessing. A couple years ago, I was made co-facilitator on an early intervention program for preteens and teens dealing with mild to moderate substance use issues. About a year into my time with the program, I was made lead facilitator. I now manage the program and continue to facilitate multiple monthly groups in Scottsdale and Tempe. It’s an incredibly positive, non-shaming, non-punitive, educational and inspirational program that has helped hundreds of local families not only get their teens back on a healthy path, but learn to communicate with one another in an intentional, proactive, and respectful way. I get to see families, who sometimes aren’t even speaking to one another at the beginning of the first session, reconnect with one another and rise above the issues that have been challenging them. Most importantly, sobriety has allowed me the opportunity to become the type of husband I should have been all along and has given me the chance to be a very good dad to an amazing daughter who was born shortly after my one-year sober date. I give thanks every day for the fact that I got clean and sober before having a child. I owe it to her and my wife to have my act together. Every moment with my daughter is a gift that I never thought I would get. If you had told me when I was in jail that my life would be like this right now, I wouldn’t have believed you though I would have desperately wanted to. I’m thankful for every chance I get to help other people, to let individuals who are struggling know that they’re not alone, and to destroy the stigma and stereotypes surrounding addiction and recovery. I take every opportunity I get to help people understand that addiction is not a failure of morality, but a behavioral health issue. If you are struggling, please speak up. Find a trusted, caring, non-judgmental, willing, and ready person and let them know what’s going on. Things can get better, but not until you make the choice to change and move forward. Get connected with local professional resources that can assist you in your recovery. If the situation calls for it, detox correctly and go through residential treatment. If not, consider an intensive outpatient program, or at least 12-step meetings. Find what works for you, and do it. Surround yourself with positive and caring people who are mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually healthy. Create a support network. Fill your phone with the phone numbers of those on whom you can call when you’re struggling– even if it’s two in the morning. Practice intentional and consistent self-care that includes healthy coping skills and positive outlets. It’s not enough to just NOT use drugs and alcohol, but it’s important to figure out what to replace them with. For me, that includes things like music, writing, art, exercise, hiking, serving others, laughter, meeting new people, and experiencing new things. Find your recipe for success and then make a point to put those pieces in place every single day. November 29th, 2019 marked eight years of sobriety for me. I’m grateful to even be alive and amazed at the wonderful opportunities I’ve been given. Every morning when I wake up, I give thanks for the tremendous amount of grace I’ve been shown. I’m astounded at how much my life has managed to change for the better in that short amount of time. It makes me excited to see what’s next. Thank you for taking the time to allow me to share my story with you. I hope it benefits you in some way. Shane",

Not handwritten. Royal archives, Ce Raedhil.) --- Gusje padded down the palace hallway, her leather sandals scraping over the worn wooden flooring. Even at midday it was dreary inside the hulking edifice - there were few windows to let in the light, and those only showed the diffuse grey that fought its way through the omnipresent clouds roofing the valley. The remainder and majority of the light in the palace came from a small fortune in glowering qim, kiln-charged for lack of sun and swinging in chains. She had never thought for a moment that she would long to feel the sun’s merciless rays on her skin, but the damp and dark had left her feeling sapped of something vital. Fortunately, the sun was not the only remedy available to her. She came to one of the mammoth exterior doors and pushed hard on the thick timber until it swung wide. The melancholy grey light spilled in, and Gusje practically ran out to meet it. Moss-slick pavers gave way to dewy grass spotted with white and blue flowers. She kicked off her sandals as she walked, making her way to a carved whitestone bench half-overgrown with grasping ivy. All around her vines crept sinuously over trellises or the odd arched pergola, hanging with flowers and fruit that twisted sweet aromatic tendrils into the cool morning air. In the middle of the swaddling green riot, Gusje sat and was calm. \--- “Look at her,” Arjun said wonderingly, craning his head out the window. “I’ve never seen her sit so still for so long.” Mark snorted, not looking up from the map he was studying. “She’s from the desert, she hasn’t ever seen anything like the palace grounds. Plants where she’s from are either ‘poisonous’, ‘dead’, or ‘actually a lizard.’ Even under the cerein it was never really lush like this.” “It’s true, this is nearly as strange for her as it is for us,” Arjun chuckled, shaking his head. “Albeit for different reasons. I think it’s good that she’s able to appreciate the beauty of it. She’s so young, to be in the middle of such conflict.” “Kids grow up fast in a warzone,” Mark said grimly. “I’ve seen younger running around with a rifle.” “...you say, yourself a wise old man of - what, twenty?”, Arjun said, only half-smiling. “You and Gusje are practically the same age, from my perspective.” “Twenty-two,” Mark retorted, waving away Arjun’s smirk at the correction. “And we don’t know how old anyone is, doc. You ever notice how they don’t have years? Months? They just count in days, and anything farther back than a few dozen of those they start talking about ‘when so-and-so had his first child’ or ‘when the cerein was young.’” He tossed his hands in the air frustratedly. “Tesvaji could be my age and we’d have no idea.” “A fair point,” Arjun conceded. “Something to ask Tasja about, perhaps. Whatever her age in our terms, Gusje strikes me as someone in the process of growing up quickly. The only home she’s ever known is threatened, both she and her family were attacked, and now she’s playing interpreter for the likes of us.” He craned his neck to look back down at her. “I can’t help but feel some regret, for our part.” Mark sighed, setting aside the map. “Don’t,” he advised. “Shit was coming down the pipe for them whether we were here or not. Without us she’d be with Mosidhu’s son.” He stood up and joined Arjun at the garden window, resting his shoulder against the cold stone of the wall. “Stuff like this, it’s too big. You can never stop all the bad from happening, but you can sometimes pick where or how. Even then, you’re not gonna be perfect.” “Very few people have ever accused me of that,” Arjun said wryly. “Still, that strikes me as a healthy attitude to take in unhealthy times, and advice I should consider following.” “Even if it does come from a wise old man of twenty-two?”, Mark said, raising an eyebrow. Arjun raised his hands, conceding the point. “I surrendered the moral high ground when I brought your age into it, I admit,” he laughed. “You and Mr. Gibson have valuable specialist knowledge. You’re more used to the rules of this particular scenario. If it had been only we two bumbling scientists Vimodi would probably have us wrapped around his finger by now.” “Yeah, well,” Mark sighed. “We’re not out of the woods yet. I figure we only have another day before a report from Tizhodhu ends up on Vimodi’s desk. I can’t say what’s in it, but I’m almost certain we’ll be under increased scrutiny after it arrives.” “Do you want to leave tonight, then?”, Arjun asked. “Slip out in the dark?” Mark shook his head. “Tasja gave us our next destination but we still need to take care of aid for the Cereinem here. I think after last night we’ve got... well, call it ninety percent of our Plan B worked out, as well as an idea of how he’ll probably try to come after us. The trick is getting Vimodi to commit to supporting the Cereinem without any formal agreement from us to hand the truck over, then getting proof of the agreement to someone like Tizhodhu or this city council. Preferably both. Seems like they’re very big on ‘letter of the law’ over here, and his rivals in the council would love to find him breaking an agreement he’s signed.” “I assume the remaining ten percent involves the role you have in mind for Tasja?”, Arjun said. “We do need someone with inside knowledge of Sjan Saal, and he’s the best choice so far.” Mark nodded. “I don’t want to rely on him too much, he’s still an unknown quantity. He’ll have limits to what he’ll do for us and we can’t guarantee what he knows won’t leak to Vimodi. Implied threats only get us so far.” “He’s been helpful enough getting us maps,” Arjun pointed out. “Showing us the *vacata* devices-” “Plate-pairs, I think,” Mark said. “Something along those lines. Yeah, those were good to know about. Explains how Tizhodhu could call ahead but still had to send a courier. I think the navy used to use a codebook system as well, in the early days of radio.” He leaned back against the wall, ruffling his hair through his fingers. “I’m not denying the kid’s been helpful, but he’s just a kid. Hell, he’s basically doing an internship from what I can tell. From the way he jumped at showing Jesse and Jackie the library I think most of the reason he’s helping us is that his day-to-day duties have him bored out of his skull.” “He’s certainly had his mind on things other than the broader situation,” Arjun said with a grin, glancing out the window. “The poor boy seems to bring the conversation back around to Gusje every five minutes without even noticing. He-” Arjun stopped short, the smile dropping from his face. “Mark,” he said abruptly. “Did you see Gusje leave?” Mark spun to look out the window, seeing only a stone bench amid the greenery. “Fuck, I wasn’t looking,” he spat. He stalked back to the table quickly to grab his backpack, then collected his rifle from against the wall. “Stay here,” he told Arjun. “Brace the door with a chair after I leave, don’t open up again unless someone asks in English.” Arjun nodded mutely, and Mark stormed out of the room. \--- The soft rustle of Tasja’s robes trailed after him like a chorus of whispers as he hurried down the darkened hallway. Inwardly, he cursed the moment he had ever considered his post uninteresting; tedium was preferable to having Vimodi popping out from behind corners every moment of his day with another urgent errand, task or message. Even the sanctuary of the archives, the traditional redoubt of clerks and scribes, could no longer offer protection from the governor’s whims now that the visitors from Gadhun Draat had kicked everyone into a frenzy. He had been forced to leave Jesse and Jackie in the scriptorium to attend to Vimodi in person only to be summarily dismissed with a command to summon Gusje to the governor’s office. His last interaction with the stone-faced Cereinem girl had not filled him with confidence. Still, she had sought him out specifically that night. He recalled the old groundskeeper at the foundhome lamenting the strange and unknowable ways of women, and at the time he had put it down to the old man being an ugly drunkard. Now, confronted with the strange and unknowable, he found himself wondering if he had judged the old man unfairly. The din of raised voices from ahead jolted him out of his introspection. Sound carried well in the old stone corridors of the palace despite the wood paneling, so he was able to clearly discern Gusje’s irritated tones well before he was in sight of her. “-tell you whenever I want to take a walk,” she fumed. “Don’t forget where you are,” Mark’s voice echoed back, causing Tasja’s step to hitch a bit. “It isn’t safe to wander off on your own. If you’d just let us know-” “I’m not a *child*,” Gusje hissed furiously. “I’m here as the representative of my family, my people. My father trusted me enough for that, but you don’t trust me to walk into the garden on my own?” Mark let out an irritated grunt. “It’s not about trust, Gusje, it’s about safety. Things are coming to a head, Vimodi will try to-” Tasja rounded the corner and Mark fell silent, immediately turning to fix him with a cold stare as his hand dropped to rest atop a black object strapped to his hip. Tasja would not have thought himself capable of overlooking Gusje’s supremely irritated mien, but Mark’s pale-eyed stare had him transfixed with sudden, overwhelming fear. The large man had none of the amiability and casual cheer that he had displayed the previous night. Tasja felt his own death breathing frostily over the exposed skin of his throat, hovering only heartbeats away- And then it was over, Mark straightening up wearily while Tasja’s heart thudded against his ribs with unpleasant vigor. “Tasja,” he said. “Didn’t hear you coming up. You need something?” “Ah,” he managed. “Vimodi Ma wants to meet. With Gusje Mas.” His voice trembled and cracked, but he was still too terrified to be embarrassed. Mark’s glare had left him with an uncomfortable awareness of his own fragile mortality. “Figured he would eventually,” Mark sighed, missing another venomous look from Gusje. “Well, lead on.” “Ah,” Tasja stammered again. “I’m sorry, Mark Rys, but Vimodi Ma gave no instructions about bringing you as well. I was under the impression he wanted a private…” He trailed off, words dying in his throat as Mark’s eyes narrowed. The pressure returned, and he became uncomfortably aware of his blood pulsing under his thin, vulnerable skin. Gusje snorted and pushed past Mark to stand next to Tasja. “It’s fine,” she said coolly. “You’re the one that wanted to bring me along to speak for you, so *let me*.” Mark’s eyes flicked to Gusje. “Tasja,” he said lightly. “Could you give us a moment?” Tasja hurriedly excused himself and stood some distance away while Mark and Gusje exchanged furious whispers. Their conversation grew increasingly animated until Mark flung his hands into the air with wordless exasperation. He took a dark, boxy object from his belt and pressed it into Gusje’s hands, muttering insistently. She rolled her eyes, but eventually stowed the object in a pouch at her waist before turning sharply from Mark to walk towards Tasja once more. “Let’s go,” she said, her tone not inviting a response. Tasja mutely led the way from the room, feeling Mark’s eyes on the back of his neck even after they turned the corner. They walked in silence the whole distance to Vimodi’s office, Gusje a stalking whirlwind of indignation behind his hurried steps. When they reached the heavy doors to Vimodi’s receiving room he flung them open with a palpable sense of relief. Vimodi was sitting at his desk, his lips splitting into a fleshy, unctuous smile when he saw Gusje arrive. “Ah, Gusje Mas,” he rumbled. “Do come in and sit.” His eyes flitted over to Tasja and narrowed. “Tasja, get us water and find some paper. I’ll need you here for this.” Tasja’s fleeting hope of escape vanished like fog in the high desert as he shuffled to carry out Vimodi’s commands. The governor turned to where Gusje was sitting lazily in one of his ornate wooden chairs, her hand idly stroking the visage of a snarling esemadhe carved into the armrest. “Gusje Mas,” he began. “It grieves me to hear of the threat to your people. Although you are the first to visit in my tenure here, we have enjoyed good relations with the venerable Cereinem and Ademen Tacen from the time of my fathers and theirs before them.” He folded his hands in front of him, leaning forward. “I hope we can continue this tradition of mutual benefit even in the face of our current crisis.” “Vimodi Ma,” she replied, her voice steady. Tasja noted, however, that one of her hands was fidgeting nervously in her waist pouch, her foot tapping a nervous tattoo on the floor. He realized he was staring at her leg and shifted his eyes hurriedly back to his paper. “I was sent by my father to secure aid in protecting the cerein of my people, and others that may yet be saved. Will you send men to help us?” The governor sighed, his face looking very tired for a moment. “I will be blunt,” he said wearily. “The king’s own forces are powerless to stem the advance of the Emperor in the Vidim Vai. I have read the reports, and they all agree on one thing - resisting the blight on an open field is suicide. Outside the walls of Idran Saal, the only city they have not yielded is the fortified port of Sjatel - and that, I fear, is only because the enemy has yet to seriously contest it.” “My men must stay at the wall,” he continued solemnly. “I am sorry, Gusje Mas, but if the *draam je qaraivat* fall then the desert is lost to us.” Tasja saw her composure crack for a moment, an anguished flash passing over her face before it returned to grim focus. “If there is no aid to be had, then I agree,” she said, each word sounding like it cost her blood rather than breath. “My people must travel to Sun’s Rest.” “And they will find refuge in our valley,” Vimodi promised solemnly. Tasja caught the particular tone of voice he used when he was offering terms and began to scratch down Vimodi’s words on the page in front of him. “The gates will open to them and we will shelter them behind our walls.” “I thank you, Vimodi Ma,” Gusje said. “My people will be glad to know they have refuge here. However…” She hesitated, although even Tasja could spot it as theatrics. “I worry for their safety on the journey to your borders, as well as their livelihood. The cerein and its lands are our lifeblood, and those who flee will arrive with nothing.” A flash of annoyance crossed Vimodi’s face, but only for a moment. It was, Tasja realized, a concession he had anticipated. “For any Cereinem who shelter here we will provide food, animals and land to work,” he said evenly. “I will also send men and carts to help hasten their journey.” Gusje looked at Vimodi for a long moment before nodding. “You are generous, Vimodi Ma,” she said, although her tone was carefully neutral. “I wonder if we will ever be able to repay such a gift.” Vimodi fluttered a hand at her magnanimously, shaking his head. “Nonsense, it is the least we can do in the face of such evil,” he murmured. “The council will begrudge me the loss of that land, covetous as they are, but their complaining means little. However, if you were inclined to think of the greater welfare of the valley, in the interest of reciprocity…” He trailed off, and as his eyes came to rest on Gusje there was a hard glint to them. “I fear for our safety when the blight reaches our walls, Gusje Mas,” he lamented. “And I do believe it is only a matter of time, not of chance. Though we have rich lands we are not wealthy, and we have much territory to protect. During a time of war I could not say that our carts and messengers would be adequate to coordinate movements and logistics along the span of the wall, much less throughout the valley.” He leaned forward, steepling his fingers and looking at Gusje intently. “We need a means of fast, reliable travel.” Gusje did not react to his words visibly but Tasja saw her arm twist as she clenched the fist she held hidden in her pouch. “And in the interest of the valley, you would like to have the chariot,” she said dully. “I understand, Vimodi Ma, but it is not mine to give.” “Oh, my child, do not mistake me,” Vimodi said soothingly. “I know it belongs to your companions from far Gadhun Draat, and I would never want to suggest otherwise. However, time is our enemy and we must make every day count if,” he said softly, his voice dropping to a murmur, “we are to ensure the safety of *all* those in the valley. I know your companions would gladly agree to help if they could see the severity of our need. I only fear that given their… difficulties in speaking, such understanding will cost us precious time - time we cannot afford.” Gusje looked at the governor with a pained expression, her hand clenching tightly enough that the tendons were standing out on her wrist. “What would you have me do?”, she asked quietly. “Chariots usually have an activation sigil,” Vimodi explained, unable to keep the excitement from his expression. “Used to set them in motion. They also have sigils locking the doors. If you could obtain these for me we could make use of the chariot immediately. Your companions will be treated as honored guests, and I hope that in time they will come to understand the correctness of our actions. Surely they, too, would like to see your people safe.” Gusje hesitated for a long moment, and Tasja could read furious thoughts in the small movements of her face. Vimodi simply smiled, watching, and after an extended silence Gusje sighed and bowed her head. “Their chariot does not use an activation sigil,” she said, her voice small and quiet. “You simply push a plate to activate it.” Vimodi’s smile grew. “And the locks?”, he prompted her eagerly. Gusje sagged further. “A small metal key, attached to a larger object so it does not become lost. They keep it in the drawer of the wooden table in the corner of our room.” She looked up at the governor’s beaming face, a hint of defiance creeping into her eyes. “Will you also ask that I take it from them?” “There is no need for you to go that far,” Vimodi assured her. “I will arrange for the… request to be made. Tasja, you have the terms?” “Food, animals and land for the Cereinem upon their arrival,” Tasja said shakily, reading his paper. “Assistance for their evacuation to be delivered immediately.” He glanced up at Gusje before reading the next section and found her eyes cold and hard. “Fair treatment and guest right for the Gadhun Draatim travelers, all in return for information about the operation of the Gadhun Draatim chariot and the location of its sigil.” He took the paper from his slate and held it out to Vimodi. Vimodi snatched the proffered paper and scanned over it, then tore it cleanly in two. Gusje and Tasja gaped, but Vimodi held up the paper to show that it now only contained the declaration of support for the Cereinem. “No need to make your end of the agreement too public, since you’ve already upheld it,” the governor said, winking. “We’ll keep that a private matter.” He grabbed an ornate seal from its resting place on his desk. “Oh, one more thing, my dear,” he said casually. “I will not add it to the terms as written, since we have trust between us - but I will need you to stay in new quarters this evening. They are more fitting for one of your station, regardless.” She gave him a lingering, evaluating look before nodding slowly. “Wonderful,” Vimodi said brightly, flourishing the seal. He pressed it to an inkpad, then to the paper. “There, my dear,” he said, sliding the paper over to her with the crest of Sjan Saal still glistening wetly upon it. “If you have no seal you can use your thumbprint as a mark,” he added. Gusje shot him a look, a flash of annoyance bleeding through her defeated slouch. “I am a daughter of the Madi,” she said stiffly. “Of course I have a seal.” She withdrew her hand from the bag and slipped her bracelet off her wrist to reveal a small saon drai tucked into the braided cordage. She pressed it firmly into the inkpad, then once more onto the paper. “What an interesting trinket,” Vimodi murmured, his eyes locking on to it. Tasja couldn’t resist stealing a look at the inked impression of the coin, his eyes tracing over two seven-pointed stars and a reversed curve of flowing script arcing from a stylized *jehan* flower. In the middle was written *ruud* in ornate aejha glyphs. “That’s…”, he choked, his eyes widening. “Maja’s grace, an *asolan*?” Vimodi’s eyes were alight, staring in naked greed as Gusje tucked the coin back against her ink-smudged wrist. “You’re full of surprises, Gusje Mas,” he said smoothly. “Before this I had heard only rumors about the treasures of the Cereinem.” Gusje looked up at him with dull, sunken eyes. “There is no treasure that compares to the cerein,” she said quietly. “If there is nothing else, I would grieve for it now.” “Of course, Gusje Mas,” he said unctuously, inclining his head to her and tapping two fingers to an inconspicuous saon drai affixed to his collar. A low tone sounded from outside and two guards entered, looking at Gusje expressionlessly. Vimodi handed Tasja the signed paper and inclined his head towards the door. “Tasja, please show her to the royal apartments.” Tasja goggled at the governor, who gave him an irritated jerk of his head that sent him scurrying to Gusje’s side. “Come on,” he whispered, hovering anxiously at her side. “I’ll take you upstairs.” She followed him out of the office, hunched and shuffling as they walked down the long corridor towards the stairs. It was evening, and the interiors were pitch-black save for the fiery light of qim from above. Two guards tailed them discreetly in the shadows, content to give them the veneer of privacy as long as they did not deviate from their proper course. “Vimodi Ma will keep to his agreement,” Tasja said, trying to sound reassuring. “He’s… well, he is who he is, but once he uses the seal it’s law.” “I’m counting on it,” Gusje said grimly. Tasja looked back and was shocked to find her standing tall and walking with easy strides beside him. In her hand, now freed from the pouch, she held a black, boxy object. “You,” Tasja stammered. “You did something.” “I made an agreement with Vimodi,” she said lightly. “You were there. I *told* Mark I’d be fine on my own.” “Wait, but you-”, Tasja said, his mind spinning. He peered at her suspiciously, pointing at the object in her hand. “What does that thing do?”, he hissed. “You wouldn’t believe me if I told you,” she said quietly, smirking and replacing it in the pouch. “I might surprise you,” he retorted. “I don’t travel much, but I know a lot. I recognized your asolan right away, didn’t I?” “You did,” Gusje admitted grudgingly. “Although you lost any favor that gained you by telling Vimodi about it.” Tasja winced, and Gusje elbowed him roughly in the side. “Showoff,” she teased him. “I’m not making fun of you, Tasja, I’ve never met anyone half as well-read as you.” “But?”, Tasja retorted, sulking but inwardly ablaze from the compliment. She smirked at him again. “But there’s no book that would tell you what a *radio* is.” \--- *“...in the drawer of the wooden table in the corner of our room,”* the radio hissed. Mark blinked, patting the keychain in his pocket and glancing at the end-table in question. Sure enough, there was a small drawer in its side. “Do we have anything in that drawer?”, he whispered. Jackie got up to check while Tasja hesitantly read the terms of the agreement. “Nope,” she replied. “Empty.” *“...more fitting for one of your station, regardless,”* Vimodi oozed, the delight in his voice apparent even over the radio. “Cocksucker,” Mark observed sourly. “He’s keeping her under guard until he’s got the key in hand. So much for Plan B.” “She did lie to him,” Jesse pointed out. “It’s a reasonable precaution.” Jackie smacked him on the shoulder. “He’s trying to steal our ride,” she said crossly. “He’s fair game.” “I should have gone with her,” Mark muttered, shaking his head. Arjun shrugged. “If you had, he wouldn’t have offered terms. There was never any hope of Gusje extracting a promise from him with us on her side, he would have just demanded that we hand over the keys right then and there. As it stands, he’s just given us a concession for something he was going to do anyway. At least now we have advance warning.” “Ugh,” Mark grunted, burying his face in his hands. “My fucking head. You know, if there had been anywhere else to go I’d say coming here was a mistake.” “It’s not so bad,” Jackie said optimistically. “I mean, Gusje got what she needed and we know where we need to go next. We got a lot of good info from Tasja and Jesse has a mysterious stalker girlfriend. All we need to do now is quietly get the hell out of Dodge.” She smiled and spread her hands wide, ignoring Jesse’s pained look. “First things first, Jack,” Mark said, sitting back upright. “I figure Vimodi is a fan of instant gratification, so we’re going to have company sooner rather than later.” “We should move, then,” Jackie said, grabbing her pack. “Get Gusje out and leave, we need to be gone before they get here.” Jesse shook his head. “No,” he said quietly. “Vimodi needs to find us here, otherwise he’ll know Gusje set him up. He’ll back out of the agreement before it’s public knowledge. He needs to think he’s won at least long enough that his rivals in the council get a copy of the document.” “So, what, we’re just supposed to let him steal our truck?”, Jackie asked, exasperated. “He needs to think he has a chance, at any rate,” Arjun mused. “I don’t suppose anyone has any ideas?” “You think I’d give Gusje the OK to sell us out without a Plan C?”, Mark chuckled. “I figure this will be easy enough, he’s operating under the assumption that we’re pushover nobles and he holds all the cards. He won’t want to use violence, but he’ll try to threaten us with it. We’ll just stand firm, flex a bit and call his bluff. There’s a pretty good chance he won’t try and force the issue on the first try and we can stall him until the agreement with Gusje can’t be reversed.” “I think we underestimate his greed at our peril,” Arjun said. “Wasn’t it you that said the only thing standing between him and everything he’s dreamed of is us?” Jackie nodded emphatically. “Arjun’s right,” she said. “You’re counting on him acting smart or at least cautious, but people do stupid shit when they get greedy.” “Yeah, you’re not wrong,” Mark admitted. “Not saying we shouldn’t have a contingency for him trying to flat-out rob us, just that we should try not to escalate if we can help it. If someone gets seriously hurt our chances of helping the Cereinem go way down.” “So, what?”, Jackie asked. “I don’t think Vimodi would mind hurting *us* if he could get away with it.” Mark thought for a moment, then chuckled and looked over at Jesse. “I just had a terrible idea,” he said merrily. “Remember when Correia nearly got himself busted down to E-1 last year?” Jesse blinked. “When he rigged the - oh. Mark, no. You just said we shouldn’t escalate.” Mark flashed his teeth in a predatory grin. “And we won’t. We’ll just give ourselves some options for… proportional response.” “You paused before you said that,” Jackie noted. “That makes me think it will be a bit disproportionate.” There was a pause. “Maybe a bit,” Mark admitted. \--- [Jackie - Page 20](https://i.imgur.com/Ff23Peg.jpg) [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/ezcicw/inheritors_of_eschaton_part_11_plan_d/) Happy Wednesday, folks!

736,"I think it's time I tell my story too.Okay everyone, I think it's about time I write out my story & share it with you all. Be prepared for a long read. This has taken up the last 6 years of my life. But before a lot of it will make sense & the choices, some stupid, that I made, I will have to start at the beginning, a long long time ago when my PA & I were just kids. So forgive me if I am all over the place with this. I have never written this out in full before. It all started when I was 13 years old in the 8th grade in 2002. One of my elective classes was located at the nearby High School about a mile up the road. It was 3/4ths of the way through the school year & a new student had arrived in our class. I couldn't get my eyes off him. He looked lonely, kinda sad, & in need of a friend. I so badly wanted to be that friend but I was too scared to even talk to him. So I didnt. I instead took the creepy approach & just stared at him practically everyday until the school year was over. When the year ended, I highly regretted not introducing myself but I was also thankful I didnt because I knew he was in High School & I was just another loser middle school kid. Prior to being 13, I was an outcast to say the least. When I turned 13, my father left my mom. It was the first time I had ever been free to be myself. So I got contacts, upgraded my wardrobe & people actually started noticing me. So I never used to give myself credit for what I was worth. When the 9th grade started, I had that kid still on my mind. Mind you, I didnt even know his name. The class was a language class & in that class we were to choose a new name to be called by; A name from that language. We had never properly met much less spoken to eachother. Hell, I assumed he didnt even know I existed. I got my first boyfriend in the 9th grade & I was not ready for what dating entailed. It lasted a month & I called it quits. I felt too pressured. I was then mocked for my ""prudeness"" which was actually inexperience. I was scared to say the least. Then a senior wanted me to be his girlfriend. He was 17 & I 14. we rode the same bus, sat next to eachother in science and even lived one street over from eachother. It had bad news written all over it. Soon after, I was being pressured for sex. I turned him down at first because I wasnt ready. I knew I wasnt ready. But then, words were spreading & I felt that pressure again. I gave in & it was a nightmare I will never forget. I was scared, embarrassed, humiliated & felt used. ""But I was dating a senior"" I kept telling myself. ""I cant lose this opportunity"" I kept repeating. ""I dont want to be a loser anymore"" I'd say while crying in the mirror. He dumped me after 5 months. It was for the best. Then one day at the practical end of the school year, a friend asked me to come hang out over with their group & so I did. I'm sitting on the ground & to my surprise, the kid is sitting right behind me. I start sweating in anxiety. My friend looks me dead in the eyes and says ""hey have you met (name)?"" & walked off. If any of you have seen 'How I Met Your Mother', she basically pulled the ""Have you met Ted?"" wingman move on me. All I could say was ""yeah we had class together once last year"" & then he spoke. He said ""arent you dating that one guy with the slipknot hoodie?"" I said not anymore. He smirked & said ""thats cool"". About a few days later we were walking together down the hall when he said ""so hey, um, I like you.....like how people like people...."" I chuckled in giddyness & said me too. About a day later he asked ""soooo are we like, boyfriend and girlfriend or something like that?"" I remember being so excited nervous & scare that all I could say was ""sure"". SURE??? Wow, real enthusiastic Foreverinfinate. LOL From that day on, I was madly in love with him. So infatuated I could hardly breath. This was it. He was the one. I couldnt get him off my mind & he was so amazingly perfect. The most sweetest boy I could have ever dreamed of. He was so polite, caring, gentle, curtious, giving, etc. He was everything I ever dreamed a boyfriend to be at that age. Then it happened. at this point I was 15 he 17. I knew what he wanted. I knew he would soon go for it & he did. He was starting to run down the bases before I stopped him & said ""I'm on my period"". I lied. I was scared. A few weeks had passed & he tried again. I lied again. I was still too scared. Shortly thereafter, I was raped by a fellow classmate that had bullied me all throughout middle school. He asked to be FWB & I turned him down. He didnt like that. He came to my house, & when I went to answer the door, he shoved me down, dragged me to my room & did his deed & left. I was raised in an abusive household & learned from a very very early age to NOT fight your abuser or you'll have your ass handed to you. So I just laid there, motionless, crying my eyes out in disbelief. I told no one. I was clearly not acting myself & my BF had noticed. He asked me what was wrong. So I told him. We stood in silence for what seemed like 10000 years & right as the bell rang to go to class, he broke up with me. It lasted 2 days before he begged for me back, but it was different. Though he loved me & I knew it, he didnt know how to deal with the emotions he was feeling towards what happened to me. we didnt see eachother for 3 weeks. He was avoiding me like the plague so I eventually had a friend breakup with him for me because he wouldnt even take my calls. I cried for what felt like forever. It wouldnt be until 10 years later that I finally was told the reason for why he went MIA on me. After we broke up is when I met my oldest sons father. The first boy to break my heart by using other women & their bodies against me. He cheated on me so many times over the 4 years we were together, I havnt been the same since. Throw in being a teen parent at 17 & you have one hell of a destroyed perception of yourself. It was the first time I had truly hated my body. It was the first time I saw myself in a negative light. I hated the way I looked, the stretch marks from childbirth, the loose skin, etc. I cried & cried and wished to have my old BF back. The sweet one I felt was my fault for losing for not putting up a fight with my rapist. After he skipped out on us, I met someone so manipulative & abusive I didnt stand a chance & we too had a child together. Some unfortunate things happened & we had to move to separate states for a bit. But he held our child hostage & only let me take the one that wasnt his with me, so I had no choice but to come back to him. While I was gone I had gotten a Facebook message. We are now in 2010. SURPRISE! It was my HS love. Heart racing, hands sweating, I replied to him. I saw his picture & every feeling I had ever felt for this guy came flooding back like I was 13 all over again, seeing him for the first time. We spent 6 hours on the phone that night. Thats when I learned he too had a child & a wife. I was crushed. A wife? I thought to myself. I lost my shot. I cried. But we kept talking every single day for hours at a time. Come to find out, they were getting a divorce soon. His wife had lost her job for sleeping with her boss in his office. We would spend hours talking about our previous relationship turmoils, the people who did us wrong, etc. I felt like we were one, on the same page. When I got back to my home state, we continued to talk. I was told the ""my ex is crazy"" story. Such a bunch of bullshit is what it was but I ate it up & felt sorry for him. He came to my house & we finally slept together for the first time. Then I never heard from him again. For an entire year. I didnt understand. I felt so used. I hated him. Then he told me, his wife & he were trying to reconcile for their daughter. I tucked my tail between my legs, lowered my head & tried to move on. But I couldnt. I was addicted & he was my drug. But, they couldnt make it. She filde for divorce & they went separate ways. We werent talking at this point. Until another random message on Facebook. We were still friends on there but never spok. Out of nowhere he commented on a post of mine. Then another. Then another. We started texting shortly soon after. I asked where he was staying at these days & lo and behold, he was living literally down the road from me. I was shocked. I had spent the last 10 years begging to have this man back through every dream, 11:11, birthday wish, shooting star, you name it, I wished upon it to have him again. We agreed to meet up for the first time since he ditched me after sex. I was sooo hooked on him I completely looked past the huge slap in the face from before. I made exuses. I was naive in the name of love. It was 2012 by now. I was just as in love with him as I was the day I first saw him. After that we were glued to eachother. It had only been a couple months but things werent adding up. One day he told me if I heard someone knocking on his door, it was probably this ""crazy"" girl that was obsessed with him. She turned out to be his FWB & also his youngest brothers GF. those rose colored glasses had me looking past it. I took a look at his FB profile again & noticed, hes only friends with girls & they are throwing themselves at him all over the place. He essentially had become a player I realized. It was almost new years when he asked me to be his date to a NYE party he was invited to. I was thrilled but nervous due to social anxiety. that night went horribly wrong. Alcohol & sports dont mix people. I made mistake. He got insanely mad. I later found him in the house owners closet butt naked with another girl moments away from having sex with her. I told her date & he ripped them both out of the closet. I took his stuff out of my car, gave him some shitty words to think about & threw his house keys right at the other girls face.. But, I was in love so I forgave him. I blamed myself & my drunk actions for pushing him into someone elses arms. I was naive. Truth is, he has no self control. He sought revenge. Something he had gotten used to doing in his previous marriage. We talked a couple days later & I told him my feelings & he had expressed his for me. I told him I was finally moving out of my abusive ex's house & that I wanted to be with him but only if he wanted to be with me. We made a commitment to stop all other interactions with other potential partners. The girl he tried to sleep with that night, tried to talk him out of it. Tried to say I was leading him on. He told her ""I have been waiting for her for 10 years. I cant fuck this up again"" When I saw that, I told myself I needed to trust him for now and not his past. Bad Idea. I was naive. I moved into my new place & I was the happiest woman to ever live. I hadnt been that happy since the day he asked me to be his GF all those years ago in High School. I was living a dream, or so I thought. A few months in I thought I'd surprise him by making a picture of me to be his phone background. I take said picture with his phone, go to his gallery to select the picture & there it is. Tons of homemade porn with his FWB/little brothers GF. What I thought I had known, was finally confirmed for the first time. I was devastated. The dates on the pictures made me realize he was sleeping with her sometimes right after sleeping with me. I wanted to die. I confronted him 3 days later when I gained enough courage to. He explained it all away as shame. He lied because shame. I tried to understand so badly until I eventually blocked it out. I made him delete everything. But i had bigger problems to deal with regarding him. He was an alcoholic. Through losing his daughter from divorce, he chose to wash the pain away with alcohol. He drank a bottle of vodka a night. My father was a raging abusive alcoholic & I swore I'd never ever be with a man like him. Yet here I was. He came to my house one night drunker than a dog. Arguing with me, yelling at me & then he called me his exwifes name. I died inside & kicked him out & broke up with him. I was free & I shoulda ran. But I was in love. I was naive. I told him no more liquor, I cant be around it, I dont even drink myself. To my surprise, he put it down. He now only drinks 2 beers on Fridays & Saturdays. I can live with that. So I took him back. again. Told him this was his last shot & to never ever lie to me ever again. He agreed. Of course he agreed. The rest of that year wasnt so bad. It was then 2014 & money wasnt adding up correctly. He had moved in with me at the end of 2013 & he seemed to never have his half of bills. After some digging & looking at paystubs, I came to find out he had a $2000 dollar unpaid loan & thats where his checks were going. I was PISSED! A couple weeks later he leaves his FB logged in on my computer. I start to remember that he used FB to cheat on his ex all the time. Always talking inappropriatey to other women. So I took a peak. Not only did I find he was ogling my FB friends pictures but also has a very inappropriate convo with a ""childhood BFF"". A girl I had known since I was 11. I confronted him about her AND the loan. He was like a deer in headlights. He told me why he took out the loan. He felt like less of a man for not being able to afford a bang up Christmas prior & didnt want to disappoint me or his daughter. However, I am the least materialistic person I have ever met. I shit you not, right now I am wearing a jacket I have had since I was 12. I sat back & decided, ""ok. I can see why he took out the loan. I dont know what it feels like to be a man or the man of a house, so I will take him at his word"". With the FB girl, he tried to get one over on me. He explained it was all a joke. He didnt mean it when he said he loved her or wanted to run away with her too. He was just appeasing her. So I told him how rotten of a person that makes him either way. I told him if it was just a joke on your side, get on FB & tell her the truth or I will. so he did & then I blocked her. He stopped using Facebook shortly after that. I thought our troubles were over. I knew he watched porn. Every guy did is what I told myself. It was normal I told myself. But after being betrayed with the loan & the other girl took all trust in him I had. I didnt feel special anymore. I didnt feel anything but sadness. We got into an argument again about the girl & I remember going back over his past throwing it in his face. He defended himself & screamed ""I havent cheated on you with anyone! I watch porn but I havnt cheated!"" there it was. My confirmation. After that fight I came to him & expressed how I was feeling. How down upon myself I had gotten due to his messages with that girl. I felt cheap. A dime a dozen. I asked him if he would either cut down on his usage of porn or stop completely until I could figure out why for the first time in my life, I was threatened by other women. He agreed. Too easily. I remember him telling me he didnt need it. He didnt view regularly. Just something he did while single & got used to. I remember thinking, cool, hes on my side & willing to help me through this confusion. 3 weeks later he asks me to watch Percy Jackson with him. I had never seen it before. I said sure! We watched it & after I fell asleep, he spent hours googling the main actress nude. When I went to google takeout the next day on his phone is when I saw it. My heart sank. He lied to me. He tricked me. He deceived me. I wanted to die. I confronted him crying my eyes out. ""why, why did you lie to me!"" I shouted. All he could do was hang his head low, say im sorry & then play The scientist by Cold Play. He ruined one of my favorite songs by tainting it with memories of betrayal. He said he would stop, he didnt understand the seriousness I expressed before. blah blah bullshit. 3 weeks later, it happened again. the same patterned repeated. Only this time I called him every name in the book. Told him all I want is honesty & that if you dont want to stop just say that but dont make a false promise then lie to me. I remembered in that moment that he had given me his google password months prior to remember for him because he sucks at that. So i got on his account & I wanted to throw up. Day after day, hour after hour, lie after lie. For 3 months I watched that account without his knowing. 3 months I watched him lie to my face, until one day I got fed up. I asked him why he hadnt called me yet like he said he would. I said ""too busy staring at some other chicks boobs to remember my existence?"" and he came back defensive as hell. Calling me crazy, the whole 9 yards. So I sent him a screen shot of his youtube history. He quickly says back ""I didnt do that"" so I asked who did then? He says someone else must have taken his phone. I said ""oh. so someone took your phone, guessed your passlock and watched porn just to break us up? you might wanna beat thier ass before I do then"" he went silent. He was busted. He came home that night & tried to sooth me with bullshit hes tried before. I wasnt having any of it. I didnt care. I didnt want to hear the excuses. But he gave them anyways. I kept that password though & had even changed it so he couldnt. A month goes by & I see it again. One video watched 27 times. Wow, this lady must be amazing. It was a video of this woman jumping up & down naked. Now, to understand my threat you would first have to know, I am small chested. Having children at such a young age destroyed my development. So to go from hearing ""youre perfect for me"" to seeing a video of a woman doing something you physically cant, hurts worse than getting hit by car. It destroys your soul. I confronted him about it. The same charade happens. ""sorry sorry I wont do it again, please dont leave me, I love you, I am nothing without you."" I ate it up. I kept that password. I started feeling insane & started asking people about my situation. I was told I was being extreme. I closed up & never spoke about this to anyone again. I used to work fairly close to our house & would come home to see him & our kids on the weekends for lunch. I came home for lunch, hung out with them & then had to go back. I wasnt even in the car for 2 seconds when I logged into his account & see he had JUST watched that ladies video AGAIN. I barely just left! our children were RIGHT THERE! WHAT THE FUCK! I confronted him & he plays dumb. I show him his account & he takes my phone & changes the password to lock me out. Big fight ensues. Later that night, I ""hack"" his account by clicking forgot password & changing it again. Locking him out & giving me the truth he wouldnt let me have.For 2 months he thought I didnt have access. I let him believe that. His history was so gross. While i was waiting for his daily call, he was late because he was watching porn. While we would talk on the phone, he put me on speaker so he could watch porn. While i was sleeping next to him, porn. While eating dinner, porn. Shitting, porn. Taking out the trash, porn. His use of porn was going further & deeper. I was dying & had no one to tell or talk to. I was suicidal for the first time in my life. Regardless of my children, I wanted to die. In late 2014 he got into a car accident that nearly killed him. He spent 3 weeks on bedrest. He would cry every day & say how much I mean to him, how this changed his whole life, how he saw everything differently now, etc. I believed him & he was serious. But once he healed, those thoughts didnt matter anymore outside that moment. The new year came& so did new problems. By that time i was asking if he was looking at stuff almost daily. I was wanting to talk about it all the time. I had no where to vent to but in journals. I wanted to understand why so badly that I couldnt let it go. I guess that pissed him off & at the tail end of January, he did it again on purpose just to hurt me. He would even type sentences into google search knowing I was watching his account. I was so hurt. He purposely hurt me, he purposely betrayed me, my dreams of this man came crashing down all in that moment. Everything I dreamed him to be & dreamed to accomplish with him for over a decade were gone. just like that. I became a robot. I didnt want to feel anymore. We kept doing this dance of ""no more porn or im gone"" ""watches porn and im still here"". It was exhausting. In march 2015 he vowed to stop the pain. I chose to trust him. I dont know why to be honest. One night while we were laying in bed & I was crying & comparing myself to the women in his porn he stupidly try to tell me actresses he had crushes on that were of similar body type as me. Like a way to try and prove to me that my small body frame was what he desired IRL. One of the names he mentioned just so happens to be the main character in my most favorite movie series of all time. Resident Evil. He ruined my favorite game series. He ruined something I had loved since I was 8 years old. I died inside. That sobriety lasted a good 6 months until his brother bought him a new phone. I panicked. I had the other one completely locked down. Sure enough he went right back to the same old shit. The same old lies only I was angrier at this point. I was out for blood. When I discovered he had finally figured out what incognito was, I set my target on him. I called him every nasty thing you can think of. I used every insult anyone ever gave him, I took things out of context on purpose just to hurt him, I called him a womanizer, a pig, a manipulative excuse for a man, etc. I figured if I could hurt him just as bad as he hurt me, he'd finally realize what that felt like and stop. No. It only got worse from there. By 2016 he had 13 relapses under his belt. we both hated eachother but loved eachother too much to walk away. Sounds stupid until you live it. In let february we were on the internet trying to find me a birthday present from him. I mentioned Resident Evil stuff. So we get on ebay & start looking at things. I dunno what happened but my intuition kicked in. I asked for his phone that he seemed to be staring too intently at. I go to google & there it was. A picture of the Resident Evil actress nude. I screamed & screamed. He swore up & down he didnt click on it & then went on a whole spiel about how he accidentally clicks on things all the time. liar. Were supposed to be looking for a birthday present for me & all he can think about is is beloved actress naked. Again he ruined my favorite series. Again he reminded me that the one obsession I have, is now tainted in porn. By may 2016 the abuse intensified. We were going back & forth between me stealing his password & changing it & him finding out & changing it back. He would start staying at work late just to avoid me. When we were together, the space was so large it was sickening. By July 2016 the abuse got physical. He started shoving me on the ground & against walls. He'd get in my face & poke me hard in the chest with one finger. He may be small, but he is strong as hell. Size means nothing in terms of strength. Anytime I brought porn up it got physical. In late 2016 I was in an accident. I fractured my sternum. I spent almost 2 months in screaming agony. I wanted to die and all I could think about was who he was looking at now that i was out of commission. I was consumed with what he was doing. In december that year, he put his hands around my neck for the 1st time. I barely struggled against him. I was in such a dark place I honestly thought about letting him kill me. That would show him now wouldnt it. Its scary the things you think when you are in so much emotional & mental pain. My kids never even crossed my mind. In january 2017 his alcoholic mother was supposed to temporarily stay with us. A couple days turned into a couple weeks then a couple months. And he was using her to fuel his narcissism. I understood then how he got to be so manipuative. She was an expert at it, he learned well. I got fed up & kicked her out against her & his will. He watched porn again just to hurt me. That day I became a bigger abuser. I saw his google history & walked straight up to him & clean clocked him right in the jaw. He spun around so fast & pinned me to the floor spitting in my face choking me. I screamed & screamed until he eventually let up & I finally came clean to my mom about everthing. But what was she gonna do? What wise words would she offer living that same life herself? She had nothing to offer but a listening ear. I felt helpless & so alone. By summer of 2017 physical fights were all too regular. It was a monthly occurrence. I told no one. I spent mass amounts of time trying to protect people from finding out. In december of that year, we had another blow out fight. I finally broke up with him. I was done. I was so emotionally dead inside I didnt care about anything. Not myself not even my kids. Nothing. I just wanted the pain to end & fast. The new year came & a knock was on the door. It was his brothers. The youngests wife had ran off with their child due to his abuse. His oldest just got out of prison for punching his ex in the face. They were all abusers. Then I remembered their childhood. Their abusive dad. The way their mom just took it. They were repeating the cycle. They stuck around our place for a few months. My SIL & myself would spend hours comparing the two brothers we were with & how abusive & similar they were. How our lives were oddly the same in many ways. I spent a lot of time telling her things that I would later come to find out she told my spouse about. Her spouse would abuse her into telling him everything we would talk about. He then would tell his brother naturally. His little brother then says hes going to give his old phone to my spouse. This was January 2018. I told him no he wasnt. He gave it to him behind my back. For 3 weeks my spouse hid that phone under our couch only using it after i went to bed. On to february & he starts acting strange. Everytime his older brother is talking & I would look at him, my spouse would stand between us blocking my view. Because I had been telling him what a godsend he was for literally cleaning my house top to bottom & being the only person here helping me with chores & maintaining my sanity. My spouse got jealous & worried. He even accused me of wanting to sleep with him. The fuck? Im not you, I dont sleep with my spouses siblings. He started getting really insecure then. I fucking loved every damn bit of it. I was happy he was insecure. I was happy he was jealous. For once through all this goddamn pain, he gave some shred that he was afraid to lose me. I didnt care though. After many hours I got him to agree to sell it. I wake up in the middle of the night & find him setting it up. Now, mind you I am blind. Vision so bad without contacts I am legally blind. I jumped up off that couch snatched the phone & ran. He chased after me pinning me up against our back door, then choking me so badly I almost passed out & hit the floor. I hit my back on something & started screaming. He thought he broke my neck & started panicking saying sorry sorry & as soon as I sat up he got mean again. He wrestled the phone from my hands. I jumped on his back to get it back and he threw me on the ground. The phone was in his back pocket. I reach for it & put both my hands around it. I was NOT letting go. Neither was he. So I mustered all the strength I could & squeezed the phone so hard i broke it in half & shattered everywhere. He then took my phone so I couldnt call for help & them punched me in the face with it. I dont remember how I got it back but I did & I called my mom. She couldnt help me. She lived too far away. Her plan to move back didnt work out. I was stuck here all by myself. I was scared. I was robot again. Late February on a weekend alone, we start getting frisky in the kitchen. I was drunk for the first time since I was 14. I dont drink remember? But I did that day. We were almost at the point of sex when he goes to change the laundry over. He was taking forever. I went to go see what was taking so long and when I come up on him & flinches & shuts his phone off. I knew. I knew what was happening. I felt it. I told him unlock it. He didnt even fight me. He unlocked it & showed me everything he was looking at. He couldnt wait! He couldnt wait for me! we were JUST about to have sex & he chose a video of some other woman masturbating!? I was dead inside more than I had ever been. That was the first time he outright rejected me for someone else to my face. That night, I texted his exwife. I spilled the beans. his exwife semi took his daughter away. That only lasted 3 months. I also told his brothers about everything in which they then turned around and made fun of him. Life was crashing down upon him at a quick rate. that same week he almost lost his job from being caught smoking weed on the clock. Life was kicking him further than the ground could catch him. He hit total rock bottom. That night he & I had the calmest conversation we have ever had the entirety of our relationship. We talked for 6 hours I think it was about porn. It was probably the most open talk we have ever had about it. I think he finally understood. He finally saw the path of damage behind him. That night he vowed he was done with all of it. He was done seeking revenge, he was done watching porn to hurt me, he was done being the one thing he always promised me he wouldnt be. I had no faith. But something felt different this time. Something was just working. I dunno. I chose to trust him. One last time. I had become the abuser too. A person I hated. I wanted my life back. I dove head first into journaling everyday not just when I was mad. I dove head first into self help books. How to let anger go. How to not give a fuck. Then I stumbled upon Mark Manson & The Subtle Art of Not Giving A Fuck. I subscribed so his website. He was the first ""self help"" person that I could actually relate to. That talked like I did, that made me see things differently. I was healing. When I felt uneasy, I would go to my spouse & talk. Id ask questions that I needed answers to, I ask if hed looked at anything & he would open his phone & let me look through it. He would actually start talking to me, not belittling me. He would answer questions that were difficult to be honest about. He started laying his cards on the table. I was in disbelief & nervous it was all another trick. 2018 was a nerve racking year. We made it through 2018 pretty good. By christmas, we hadnt fought about it in months. Not a single physical fight broke out. We argued, but we saw our breaking points & started walking away instead throwing punches. It was strange. I wasnt used to this. By 2019, things were going well. Almost too well. In February for valentines, he made me a steel key he carved & grinded himself. I collect keys. I was dumbfounded. He hadnt done shit for valentines or our anniversary since the 1st year. I was shocked & for the first time ever in my life, I cried at recieving a gift. But I was proud. We still talked regularly about his use or lack thereof should I say. Anytime I had doubt, hed open his phone & show me. he's the least tech savvy person. If I questioned something, he'd explain it to me. Hed reassure me. Something he has never done. I was healing well. But I was still checking. By February 2019 he was 1 year clean. Nothing was ever found. not a single shred of anything being out of sorts. So I vowed to stop obsessing over his google history. Not only was I viewing his account & reading all his texts, I was also tracking his location. He felt smothered. Like he was being watched 24/7 because he was. I decided that if hes going to actually do this, than so will I. I needed to kick my addiction to finding things. I was checking upwards to 50 times a day. I honestly dont know how I ever got shit done or my job done as obsessed as I was but I did. I made him passlock his phone with a code I didnt know & started working on myself even more. I realized through the millions of quotes i save off facebook that I cant force him to change. He couldnt force me to change. We had to change all on our own. By this time, I was doing well in my healing. I had let all the hate from the past few years go. I forgave myself for becoming a monster & him for being one too. You cant move forward if youre always stuck in the past. A few months into 2019 & I found this sub. My god do you know what a sanity relief it is to FINALLY find people who think like you? That relate to you? Feeling alone in this was one of the biggest factors driving me to suicide. Making it all too easy to think I really was crazy. No I wasnt. I was made to appear crazy by the very man who drove me there. When I found this sub, things for me changed so quickly. Healing became easier. I was able to let go a lot of hate & anger by reading people stories here. Realizing so much. Understanding so much. Learning so much. I spent most my time on RA & askmen. Always trying to find the male perspective. Always trying to understand them yeah it helped a bit, but finding a group of people just like me was the key to my healing. Him & I have spent this past year trying to get back what we should have years ago. We started ""dating""again. Flirting with eachother, taking the quick peak of the others nakedness, slapping asses & just enjoying eachothers company. So much for us has changed. Our sex life isnt as crazy as it was in the beginning. The hour long ""can we get this over with already"" sessions didnt happen. Were down to about 20 min now which is perfect. He actually spends time pleasing me before even thinking of going straight into sex. Its more passionate & less porny. I broke out of my awkward sexual shell & for once finally felt comfortable to freely express who I am sexually. I finally felt safe for the first time in my entire life during intercourse. It has made our sex life insanely enjoyable. We had one issue last year, but it wasnt about porn. It was a big fight but never got physical or abusive. I was impressed by the both of us. a little more than half way through the year & I had finally looked at his google account for the first time in a long time. I found nothing. That story is in my post history on this sub. My trust grew even bigger that day. Now here we are in 2020 & its as if nothing has happened. I look back on the past few years & they dont seem real. Like I watched a movie & it wasnt my life. How did we get here? By choosing not to be monsters anymore. But the ultimate key is, WE chose, because change cannot be forced. I am now a mod of this sub & offer advice where i can & support where I can. People often ask how I got here. I got here by willpower, determination to succeed & not leave my children motherless. I chose to be a better me. There is no one way to heal or change. You just have to want it bad enough. Damn. That was longer than I expected & a lot was left out cause of max letters used. but This is my story. Feel free to ask questions & I'll answer them when i get back on here. My hands hurt. LOL",
737,"Return Of The Parasite - ex, over and over againaloha, after mere 2h of sleep i feel like dying - again. although iam not suicidal, my life feels not simply useless, but hopeless, as if every (future) moment will be a repetition of a past, i thought i already had mastered sovereignly.in this past of 8 years relationship, she meant everything to me, but after i discovered by accident her second relationship (the classic, had the other boyfriend on her phone), there was exclusivly one consequence to respect - to ~~respect~~ love myself and grow free of her abuse of my time, my life and my future.in these past 8 years, i have been there for her everytime, never turned her down, always understanding, always caring, always loving. she needed me, cuz i felt for her, i felt responsible for her, cuz it was me, discovering her childhood trauma of sexual abuse (she was ca. 5). this realisation was a harder time for her, but also for me. often she rejected me (not sexually, but overall), grew contextually hostile, questioned my love, our future, everything. a common accusation was cheating, she didnt trust me, she blamed me for everything wrong in her live to a point, where i was held responsible for her unability to found a family. she also disappeared for 6 months, was gone without notice to the Netherlands, but (unfortunately) returned. she was happy for a few months, moved back in (my place), took a underpaid job (i asked her not to, cuz exploitation, she accused me of not being supportive) and pushed for kids and family. i didnt refuse, but felt overtaxed, as i needed some time to adapt to the restored relationsship, as her escape (to Netherlands) had been emotionally devastating for me. also i needed to build a foundation for a family, i simply could not have kids without any income perspective. so i re-evaluated my perspective to the decision of literature, cuz i dont wanted to repeat the mistakes of my (violently) abusive parents (which jobs made them mad, i suffered from violence almost every day until my exit at the age of 17). and i almost made it, my style, my volumes grew brilliant over the next years (dont want to sound arrogant, but i have read almost everything from Aasimov to Zola (all-time favorite is Kafka), at least my development satisfied my need for reliable future perspective), but she distanced continuously until i found a break-up note and the keys (to my appartment) in my Mail-Box - she claimed to be in love with someone else, she met in her job (i asked her not take, due to exploitative wage). i didnt, couldnt just give up yet, not after all we suffered through. so i wrote her a book, (the german title denk-mal has a double meaning: monument and just-think), a suspense of every memory i had to remind her of what (esp. our and overall) love means. she returned, but refused this topic. i was suspicious, but the result of my reflection of our issues was to unconditionally trust, as i wanted to take any deficite attitude (on my side) out of the ""game"", to live an example of love for her to hold on to. i wanted to show her that she could trust me, cuz i was still there after she run-away, broke-up, hurt me with her former psychoterror, to threat me with leaving.we moved on, were happy in those following 2 years, i finalised my collection of short stories, poems and almost my novel, while she realised her lifelong dream of a Travel agency - with my money. she simply informed me of the purchase of the Travel agency with my money. and i wasnt even angry or suspicious (cuz i decided to unconditionally trust), but almost proud of my support for her. of course i demanded a clear promise of payback conditions (as i never have money issues, cuz i always care for my money). in these 2 years we grew happy again, and i finally opened up again emotionally and tried to re-integrate myself into her family and friends, although she hadnt moved back in, rarely called late-nite (as she was usually) and was gone some weekends. of course i questioned her disappearance, but her excuse was always work and family and i dont wanted to Big-Brother, but to trust (see above). but my call for her 35. birthday was answered by another guy, who claimed to have (not simply a sexual) relation with her for 2 years. devastated i ended the call wordless and seeked her out (at the travel agency), her excuse was a development out of her control, she had felt sorry for this guy, who lost his appartment and moved in to her mothers house. she described him as ignorant to her feelings and her trauma, almost annoying. the realisation of her fraud took me some weeks, until i forced a decision from her, as i wasnt able to break up, i simply couldnt (but should have for my self-respect). then the terror of reclaiming my money started, her hate-mails, her anger, her ignorance showed me a hidden side of her, i never realised. via a letter to her mother i forced her to respect the payback conditions - it was over. the next 4,5 years i suffered (had suffocation nightmares), and was diagnosed a bi-polar personality disorder. but my endurance historically is epic, since my childhood i never gave up (i never really was suicidal, although death sometimes felt like a relief, but a FAKE and cowardish exit), i developed, i fought, i won and i lived - my resumee still is to have experienced true love for myself. i did not simply treated her as equal, but as a (loved) responsibility, i have to answer all my decisions. she had been not simply a, but the factor in everything.i never missed her, as i am not emotionally masochistic, although i missed those times of happyness, but i also know, those were based on an abusive lie.during those 4,5 years isolation became standard, as i already broke up with the rest of my family before and my daily work-out shedule (of 7-11h) did not allow for friendship (or social) activities, literature or any future perspective. although many women (still) try to connect, i couldnt open up, i got critically used to my rejection of (sometimes multiple daily) contact offers (in the beginning i hated myself for being unable to connect, to allow someone else in my live). but i did not give up, as i cant imagine what giving up should mean in practice, i simply lived on as a fitness-junkie, who plays WoW for 1-4 hours after workout for recreation (i exclusively play solo, although pug (group content) on a high level). and i worked hard on my expectations, my emotional needs, the isolation and my future perspective until my emotional condition changed - i became maybe not happy, but at least somewhat satisfied with my development again. still i havent returned to writing, i never gave up this very exclusive purpose of my existence (cuz i experience life as a political mandate), but i felt the potential of allowing someone new in my life, i felt like i was about to (emotionally) open up again. the weekend before christmas she returned in tears looking 10 years older. she had been diagnosed a few months before with Morbus Basedow. and although my resolution of this my prognosis (i knew she would return, cuz no one ever loved her my way) was to spit her in her lying face and close the door - i couldnt, cuz thats not who i am. i allowed her to re-enter to some extent, my intent was to re-evaluate, as i still could not hurt her, but feared any rejection would. as she had been suicidal prior to the diagnosis and as it turned out over the next week to her abusive marriage (with the guy mentioned above).i was shocked, i felt like losing her again, although i knew, i already had lost her forever. i dont feel love, i felt sick, stuck and helpless. i was happy if she didnt call. but then iam still bi-polar and sometimes talking helps to push me beyond the depression back into (a light) version of mania (iam not speed-talking without breaks, iam always aware of my dialogue partners need, its a healthy give-and-take). she is forcing the divorce, working 11-15h a day, while trying to recover from the sickness. apparently she reaped, what she sow - an ignorant guy, exploiting her like she did to me. although i dont feel satisfied or compensated, my (unreveiled to her) opinion is, that she got, what she deserved, i also dont feel guilty or sad. but sick because of this emotional attraction, which is not sexual or love.i waited for an apology, but her explanation was simple - a development out of her control, she wanted a child, a family, a life. she reached a point in her excuses where she was trying to position her as selfless, reliable and morally good person, who cant understand how people could lie or what egoism means. i intervened pointing at her fraud, at her abuse of me after all the years i always was there for her. which exclusive effect was a reduction of her voice\`s volume and then she went on to the next topic. so my resolution was to simply break up, as i felt anger, but i couldnt. i almost had a physical breakdown, after she called and i knew i wasnt able to respect my resolution. i fought myself, this sick feelings for hours until i gave in (not up) to the phyiscal pressure - my psyche was forcing me to find another perspective.i tried, tried again to be a rolemodel, to teach what it means to care, honesty, reciprocity, involvement - what love should mean, how love is to be live to be worthy of being called love.but her ignorance of my needs is sickening me, this gone month was escalating emotional chaos to this actual break-down into depression again. i strained my back by progressing my work-out shedule to much (so i cant work-out, which is the apocalypse to me), and after the last phone call yesterday i cant sleep longer than 2 hours, i feel despair, also somewhat contempt, as she is an ignorant bitch, who will never care about my needs.and then, maybe in a few days, she ll call again, and maybe iam back on track (my work-out shedule), having survived another depression, but still feel like i wont be able to cancel her forever - i dont want this person in my life. i want to be free again from her emotional exploitation, from her abuse of my solitude, she feasts upon. one of my last remaining friends (we telephone 2-3x month) told me, i should have spit her in her face for my self-respect, but such is an (unworhty) act of violence, which opposes everything i stand for, but i dont see any constructive or at least healthy exit for me, as she still reigns supreme. i dont love her, but i love being called late-nite, her voice, her stories, i like to care, to listen, to support. but not at this cost of my self-respect, of my future. i want her to **apologize credibly**, i want her to **show insight**, to **regret** and to again **believe in love** or at least me - or get the fuck out of my life.so i think the optimal solution to regain my self-respect is to tell her this (last sentence) face-to-face, to finally (and physically) realise she is an ignorant bitch, and to be a last time a constructive rolemodel via this honesty. super - iam really not looking forward to tell such to anyone. but iam looking forward to the prognosed relief, to open up again sometimes, to return to literature.today i ll recover, the next days will be rough with hostile (physical) loads, but in the end stabilize me (as my work-out always does), will be psychecally demanding, but i never gave up life, existence and future, i never gave up myself. thank you for reading, i dont know if i will be allowed to reply, as online dialogue usually feels hostile, toxic (on a subconscious level) to me, but this (public) opening has a deeper meaning to me and a stabilizing effect. i feel somewhat understood by myself, like iam regaining control. the (conscious) re-evaluation of this relationship over the gone month finalized in this very conclusion above. it was an opportunity to prove my development, to again prove my attitude, to be a better person - maybe it still isnt over, maybe it never will be, but every sickness has to end. i want, i need to feel loved and maybe the confrontation will take a few tries, but in the end, i will be free again to love (at least myself). a classic though, the reproduction of former parental abuse in a relationsship, a self-fulfilling prophecy at its worst and still - i refuse to give up.",
738,"r/popheads Album of the Decade #3: My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy - Kanye West Artist: [Kanye West](https://imgur.com/r/kanyewest/BBEC90Q) Album: [My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantsy](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f0/My_Beautiful_Dark_Twisted_Fantasy.jpg) Released: November 22, 2010 Label: Def Jam & Roc-a-Fella Listen: [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/20r762YmB5HeofjMCiPMLv?si=x00gjH7VRZKEhZUHW7E-_Q) / [Youtube](https://youtu.be/UTH1VNHLjng) \-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kanye West has had an eventful decade. Outside of a handful of elite few there aren't many artists that continue to be such a force of personality that everyone has an opinion of him. Controversy after controversy, scandal after scandal, Kanye West has persevered and stayed in the public consciousness. Even going back to when he first started out, ""George Bush doesn't care about black people"" feels like such a distant memory simply because of the various other ways Kanye has gone and stuck his foot in his own mouth time and time again especially when it comes to album roll-outs. Just when we thought Kanye's album roll-outs couldn't get any more crazy than releasing The Life of Pablo twice as well as the infamous ""I made that bitch famous"" saga with long time feud Taylor Swift, during the roll-out for his 8th studio album Ye Kanye showed vocal support for Donald Trump, even going so far as to don a MAGA hat in public. Even so with the amount of hate that has accumulated for Kanye over the years, his career was never on as thin ice as it was in 2010. Right now is the only other time that comes close to the amount of scrutiny he was under at the beginning of the decade, and even so Kanye is way too much of an established public figure right now to ever truly go away. He could release an inane gospel record where he compares God to Chick-Fil-A and his career probably wouldn't suffer (ahem). But that wasn't entirely true 10 years ago. He had 4 albums under his belt, all of which did well and are influential in their own right, but people were ready to let him go. Looking back to the lead up to the release of his 2010 album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is strange and looking back at the album itself now is even stranger. Despite his levels of public hatred being comparable to today, the album is very specific to a certain time in Kanye's career that requires context. For the next few paragraphs I'd like to go into detail about the years leading up to My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy's release. If you want to just get to the album itself, feel free to make like Jay-Z's Monster verse and skip this part. I'll get to the album soon I promise. &#x200B; Let's start in 2008 with the release of Kanye's previous album, 808's and Heartbreak. 808's and heartbreak was a stark departure Kanye West at the time. A lack of rapping and a heavy dependence on autotune was jarring to many people who were coming off the trilogy of College Dropout, Late Registration, and Graduation, however the tonal change had incredibly strong significance to Kanye's personal life as months earlier due to complications after a plastic surgery which Kanye himself payed for. Never one to shy away from work he turned his grief into 808's and Heartbreak, however the personal struggles in his life didn't stop there. Long term girlfriend at the time Alexis Phifer called off their engagement before the release, pushing Kanye even deeper into his work. By this time in 2008 he was releasing one album a year for the past four years, all of which were written and produced by Kanye. During this time he was also producing for other artists, touring extensively, and launched the fashion line Pastelle. There was virtually zero downtime since he began working on his debut album The College Dropout in 2003. Kanye would later describe this 2008 period as the most emotionally taxing period of his life. Kanye has always made references to his own inability to deal with his own emotions in positive ways, however drowning himself in his work in order to not have to inwardly deal with his 2008 personal issues proved to be incredibly volatile as even for Kanye standards. Obviously he was never one for thinking about the long-term ramifications of his actions, however 2008 was Kanye at his most self destructive. Most of Kanye's other controversies come from a stronger place of genuine emotion(at least to himself), where as his behavior from this period tends to be more him lashing out at the world due to an inability to cope with his own personal struggles. This brings us to 2009, and arguably the biggest scandal of Kanye's career. The night Kanye made that bitch famous. &#x200B; # 2009, the night of the VMAs We all know what happened on that day and if you don't then how on earth did you even get to this subreddit? I'm impressed. If there was one true catalyst for My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy's existence, it's the fallout from him interrupting Taylor Swift as she was accepting the award for video of the year. It became such a cultural milestone that current president at the time [Barack Obama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76p9x0-2rJY) actually called him a Jackass. Shortly after that his co-headlining tour with Lady Gaga was cancelled and for what seemed like the rest of the year, I'ma let you finish jokes were a guaranteed laugh. All of this pressure continuously mounting over the course of the past few years had blown up on national TV, making him public enemy number one. Shortly Kanye appeared on [The Tonight Show with Jay Leno](https://youtu.be/CrHAb6ynStE?t=114) to apologize, however during his apology Leno asked a question that clearly shakes him. He asks what would his mom do if she were still here to see what he did at the VMAs. It takes Kanye a bit to begin speaking but he eventually says that she would be disappointing in him, and that he thinks it's time for him to take a break for a bit. For a year he isolated himself from the world. No tabloids, no distractions, no antics. Kanye would later say that he was considering all options for his life direction, even contemplating stopping music entirely. This would be the first and last break of Kanye West's career. Over the next year he would take the time to contemplate his own fame, his ego, his success, and his own self destructive tendencies, only in the later months attempting to turn all those conflicting emotions into art. The result of this which was... \------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ # My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was released November 22, 2010. People didn't know what to expect. People weren't ready to welcome Kanye back with open arms, yet they were interested in how he'd respond to a years worth of ridicule from the likes of SNL, South Park, and every other mainstream news outlet on the planet. So now that we've set the scene, let's get into the album proper. # Dark Fantasy The album starts off with an opening poem from Nicki Minaj. The poem is based off of [Roald Dahl's](https://youtu.be/dLmNG5EbHvc?t=42) (yes that Roald Dahl) retelling of Cinderella. This serves as a metaphor for his career as how romantic and wonderful it starts out, when the clock struck twelve, it all came crashing down around him. The borrowing of the poem also starts off one of the key themes of the album. Roald Dahl loved retelling traditional fairytales, but gave them morbid and unexpected endings. Throughout the album, Kanye delivers lyrics of sharp contrast. A duality of enticing aesthetics with horrors lurking just bellow the surface. Just as a traditional fairytale can hide a morbid and unexpected. The level of fame that Kanye West achieved has shown unexpected side effects to his own mental health and his outlook on life. Later in the song, Kanye talks of seeing the devil in a Chrysler LeBaron; another example of beautiful imagery with a twisted shadow being cast over it. The phrase ""Can we get much higher?"" repeats throughout the song. Displaying how far Kanye has come in his career. He feels like he is as high as he can be, both as a celebrity and as an artist. This track comes off as the most boastful on the album; Looking out and flaunting his achievements, only beginning to see the hollowness of it all for a glimpse during the final bridge. Kanye's vocals are mixed with Justin Vernon of Bon Iver in order to give the song a slightly ghostly ending. As the success and glamour begins to wear off, Kanye is forced to look at his life in it's barest terms. Delivering a premonition of not everything being as wonderful as it's coming off, and foreshadowing his eventual fall. The chorus repeats one more time before the song ends, essentially putting those feelings in the back of his mind. Moving on to enjoy his successes. # Gorgeous Gorgeous is the song that shows how important fame is to Kanye as a symbol. Visible proof of his years of hard work despite the obstacles he's had to overcome. He compares himself to a pimp on Mount Olympus, an obviously out of place figure that's made it to the top against all odds. Both his open brashness and his race come into play as obstacles he's had to overcome. Lyrics such as ""What's a black Beatle anyway? A fucking Roach. I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach."" and the ever iconic line ""Cause the same people that tried to black ball me, forgot about two things my black balls."" show how Kanye views his blunt aggression as powerful display of pushing against barriers set up against him. Kid Cudi sings the hook to this track. >Ain't no question if I want it, I need it > >I can feel it slowly drifting away from me > >I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying > >I will never ever let you live this down, down, down In the hook we can see the anxiety starting to creep in. We can see how scared he is of losing everything he's worked for up until that point, even changing the lyrics of the final two lines on the last chorus to ""No more chances if you blow this, you bogus, I will never ever let you live this down, down, down,"" Showing that this symbol of hard work and overcoming racial prejudice is fickle. It isn't given, it's earned. And even if you're enjoying yourself and overlooking all of your accomplishments, in the back of your mind you know with one mistake it can all be taken away from you. # Power Power was the first single from the album, and with good reason. Arguably the song that has all of the themes of the album rolled into one bombastic statement of intent. Listening to the song without the rest of the album is a worthwhile endeavor as shown by how it was quickly absorbed by sporting events. It's also one of the biggest turning points on the album. The moment when the fame, and success becomes too much and it's about to implode. During the chorus Kanye states ""No one man should have all that power"" one of the most iconic lines in all of Kanye's discography. The power of fame has gotten to him, and he's beginning to lose himself to it. The lyrics >I just needed time alone with my own thoughts > >Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault > >My childlike creativity, purity and honesty > >Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts > >Reality is catching up with me > >Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody > >With these responsibilities that they entrusted me > >As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece sum up his feelings at this point perfectly. He feels like he's losing himself to this new world that he's been given. All this power and fame have clouded his mind to the point where he's not acting like himself anymore. Even when he manages to get a hold of himself he looks down at his jewelry as a reminder of his fame and his mind becomes corrupted again. The third verse shows Kanye at his most reckless. Totally aware of the hedonistic nature that he's given into, not caring about the long-term ramifications of his actions. The verse ends with the phrase ""so exciting"" being repeated, however the way that it's repeated over the instrumentation makes the phrase sound like the word ""suicide."" This combined with the outro saying ""Now this will be a beautiful death, I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go"" has a double meaning. One, Kanye is not only aware that he has lost himself but he is okay with that. He has become so corrupted by his fame that killing off the person that he once was in order to maintain it has become an easy decision for him. And two, that Kanye has since openly admitted to contemplating suicide during his 2009 low point. The burdens of fame and the curses that came with it bared such a burden on him that he began to dwell on death more frequently. The song is anchored by a sample of the song ""21st Century Schizoid Man"" by King Crimson. The 21st Century Schizoid Man in the song is someone who's morals contradict each other, once again playing into the theme of opposing forces tugging at Kanye in all directions. The bombast and propulsive chants of the song allow it to be one of the strongest bangers on the album. Exploding out in all directions the conflicting thoughts in his mind. Knowing of the cost but aware going headfirst into the darkness anyways. # All Of the Lights All of the Lights is the most successful single off of the album by Billboard's standards. It actually begins with a piano and strings interlude beforehand, easing its way into one of the best produced songs in Kanye's career. Now would be a good time to talk about the production. For the most part in this analysis I've just touched on the lyrical themes and the way they are connected to Kanye's personal internal struggle as I'm much better at talking about that than how songs actually sound like. I've also decided to wait until now to gush over the production because All of the Lights is just that well produced that I feel like it deserves it's on internal analysis. First of all, the feature spot that is only given to Rihanna is actually 14 different artists blended into one voice. Those artists include Alicia Keys, John Legend, The-Dream, Drake, Fergie, Charlie Wilson, La Roux, Alvin Fields, Ken Lewis, Tony Williams, Kid Cudi, Ryan Leslie, and ELTON FUCKING JOHN who also played piano on the track. There is a million different things happening at once in this song. Trumpets blasting off around every corner, the rattling drum machine, strings playing off the central melody, and everything being amplified times ten when the chorus hits. The chorus sung by Rihanna is echoed by the synthetic blend of the fourteen artists I listed before leading to a bombastic energy filled banger to echo the sentiments of the story being told. The production is phenomenal during the entire run of the album but if I had to pick one track to truly display Kanye's talents as a producer, not just on this album but on his entire discography, it would be this one. All of the Lights is one of the few songs on the album that is not about himself, at least not explicitly. The song is about a wife abusing con that comes back and finds that another man took his place while he was in prison. The main character of the story mostly cares about his daughter, and how he worries that he will never truly be able to be there for her as his mistakes has cost him that bond. The chorus of the song hits you like a truck, with the horns and the drums turned up to 11. All of the Lights feels like your surrounded, almost being blinded in all directions as the song swallows you whole. This song and the two songs that surround it give are probably the most propulsive songs on the record. # Monster ^(Monster is song that blah blah blah blah... something something Rick Ross... Something something Jay Z...) \*ahem\* >Pull up in the monster, automobile gangsta > >With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka > >Yeah I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka > >You could be the king but watch the queen conquer > >Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains > >Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs' > >Cause that's what a motherfucking monster do > >Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do > >Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe > >Young Money is the roster and a monster crew > >And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face > >And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't > >So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie? > >But my features and my shows ten times your pay? > >50K for a verse, no album out > >Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it > >Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent > >Tony Matterhorn, ""Dutty Wine"" it, wylin' > >Nicki on them titties when I sign it > >That's how these niggas so one-track-minded > >But really, really I don't give a F-U-C-K > >""Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki 'cause she's fake"" > >""She on a diet,"" but my pockets eating cheesecake > >And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's Child's Play > >Just killed another career, it's a mild day > >Besides, 'Ye, they can't stand besides me > >I think me, you, and Am should ménage Friday > >Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash > >I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast > >Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for > >Aaaah, I'm a motherfucking monster! # NICKI DID THAT It starts at 3:35 and we all know it. This is the verse that MADE Nicki one of the biggest superstars on the planet who would go on to conquer the next decade in style. I have nothing else to add. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDjFPlZ-Pbc) is Adele singing it. Next song. # So Appalled First off let's take a look at the line of Kanye's first verse. >I'm so appalled, Spalding ball > >Balding Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all That ones wild in hindsight huh? Anyways So Appalled plays a pivotal role in the entire album. This is the first song that really here to show how absurd how Kanye's life has become. Yes he's set the table talking about his own fame and what it means to him as well as how destructive it can be, but So Appalled lists many extravagant circumstances over a darker and hopeless beat. Every feature on the song describes the situation as ridiculous as they flaunt their ""five star dishes"" and ""thirty white bitches"". It plays on the album similar to songs like Swimming Pools by Kendrick Lamar or as I Took a Pill in Ibiza by Mike Posner. The longer it goes on the more empty the achievements sound, and the more sad the boasting becomes. The opening refrain of, >One hand in the air if you don't really care > >Two hands in the air if you don't really care > >It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous > >It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous > >One hand in the air if you don't really care > >Middle finger in the air if you don't really care > >It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous > >Life can be sometimes ridiculous comes off less as a joyous good time, and more as a group of empty people giving into their most hedonistic tendencies. The song sets the course for the next few songs in the album where not only has Kanye been subjected to a world of meaningless success that only serves to swallows him whole, he's up to his neck in tar and about to drown. # Devil in a New Dress Devil in a New Dress is one of the most obvious metaphors for the temptations of fame that Kanye plays for us during the course of the album. The song has a more romantic and seductive sound to it, playing upon the Smokey Robinson song Will You Love Me Tomorrow. This is the closest we probably get to classic Ye throughout the entire album. The lush strings playing off the soulful chorus sounds like anything that could be found on Late Registration. In the song Kanye is being tempted by a woman who he is willing to look past all possible red flags in order to have a night with her. I feel like many of the parallels to his own life are quite obvious here but what really sets the track apart from the rest of the album is the production. This is also the first song on the album where Kanye begins to become very aware of how he's been swallowed up by this temptress. This soulful, slow paced number is the perfect set up before the centerpiece of the album. # Runaway Here we are. The big climax of the album. In the journey through the album, we have seen Kanye at his highest, give in to his desires and worst tendencies, and lose himself to his ego. Now at the albums high point, we see Kanye at his lowest. Kanye has crashed and burned, and his selfish tendencies are not only affecting himself, but they are affecting other people now. It starts with a twinkling piano that carries the song into a heartfelt look at his on mistakes. Kanye goes on to give a toast to the person he's become. >And I always find, yeah, I always find > >Yeah I always find something wrong > >You been putting up with my shit just way too long > >I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most > >So I think it's time for us to have a toast > >Let's have a toast for the douchebags > >Let's have a toast for the assholes > >Let's have a toast for the scumbags > >Every one of them that I know > >Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs > >That'll never take work off > >Baby, I got a plan > >Run away fast as you can The last line in particular shows the conclusion that Kanye has come to after a year of isolation. While the song is talking about a girl, obviously we can use the context of the album to see that for the first time through all the haze and overindulgent behavior, Kanye is taking responsibility for the person that he has become. Even more than that, he is telling us the listener, that we can leave him if we want to. If as a result of his actions he loses everything he worked for, he understands. He goes on to list how bad he is when it comes to treating people right, with the only conclusion that we need to leave. We need to runaway as fast a we can from this self absorbed asshole that can never find the balance right on his own. Pusha T's verse is from the place of Kanye's ego. When Push was writing his verse for the song apparently he was being too soft. He kept bringing back verses and Kanye would respond with, ""More asshole. You need to be more of an asshole."" Once again going back to the theme of two forces being in conflict at each other, Pusha T plays in stark contrast to the regretful and humiliated Kanye as if to say this man is still in me. This is the man I've become. The self-centered narcissist with no redeemable qualities. This is Kanye at his most self aware, his most mournful, and his most humble. It's nine minutes long and you feel how ashamed Kanye West is at himself with every delicately played piano note. Runaway seems to be the song most people remember from My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and with good reason. I love looking at year end and decade end lists, and I don't think I've come across a single decade end list that didn't have Runaway close to the top. While its greatness has been well documented, I think its most impressive feat is rarely talked about. During the recording sessions for My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Kanye heard the fundamentals of the beat for four minutes, and then recorded the majority of the song completely off the top of his head. Almost none of this nine minute epic was written down, and I think all of us can feel it. It feels like a genuine eruption of emotion from the heart of someone who knows how afraid and scared he is. The three minute autotune solo at the end just adds to the feelings of despair and regret dripped all over the track. If I had to recommend one song from the album to listen to, it would be Runaway # Hell of a Life Hell of a Life can be seen as the culmination of the hedonistic lifestyle that corrupted Kanye to begin with. It takes its shape in the form of a one night stand with a porn star. The song is built around a sample from Black Sabbath's Iron Man. >Have you lost your mind? > >Tell me when you think we crossed the line > >No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need > >Grab my hand and baby we’ll live a hell of a life The first line of the chorus is ""Have you lost your mind?"" which we know by this point the answer is yes. The song is one of the most abrasive on the album, almost sounding like something that he would create five years later on Yeezus. Honestly I always found this transition to be kind of jarring. From the sweet and delicate piano work on Runaway to the heavy guitars and drums on Hell of a Life, it can definitely give you a bit of whiplash on first listen. However on repeated listens it actually feels as if that mood swing was intentional. Runaway works as a vision of humble clarity drowning in a cocktail of pills and booze, and I don't think it would truly feel that way if it wasn't for the sharp damning transition to the peak of self indulgence. # Blame Game Blame Game is a weird one. The song can be looked at through two lenses, literal and figurative. The song works both as a metaphor for his relationship with fame (obviously at this point) and his relationship with then girlfriend Amber Rose. John Legend sings the chorus here and absolutely nails the feeling of a relationship that you don't know what to do with. >Let's play the blame game, I love you more > >Let's play the blame game for sure > >Let's call out names, names, I hate you more > >Let's call out names, names for sure One of the elements that stands out the most on this track is how the vocals are pitched up and down, giving the entire album a very hazy and confusing feel to it. The song goes back and forth from anger to denial as the blame is tossed around for the relationship falling apart. Outside of the vocal distortion it's actually one of the more understated songs on the album. That would be until the ending, when a phone call with Chris Rock seemingly comes out of nowhere and starts talking about how how great it is to be having sex with a girl. It's Kanye West, he really doesn't do understated. Every time he asks her how did she get so good at what she does, the girl responds with one of the most iconic lines on the album, ""Yeezy taught me."" Here is an example. &#x200B; >Look at you, motherfucking butt-ass-naked... > >With them motherfucking Jimmy Choos on... > >Who taught you how to put some motherfucking Jimmy Choos on? > >(*Yeezy taught me*) and >This motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted! > >Even with the bezel! This is the motherfucker I wanted! > >I saw this shit, I saw it, Twista had this shit on in *The Source*! > >I remember, Twista had this motherfucker on in *The Source*! > >That's right, that's right! Yo yo babe, yo yo this is the best birthday ever! > >Where'd you learn to treat a nigga like this? > >(*Yeezy taught me*) It is a singular entity during the album that never really gets fully explained either. The most common theory of why Kanye felt so compelled to insert this weird bit of dialogue goes back to the major theme of the album of conflicting forces. Kanye didn't have it in him to make a simple song about a couple fighting. The simple somber song had to be undercut with a three minute long Chris Rock skit and honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way. # Lost in the World/Who Will Survive in America The album ends with Lost in the World and Who Will Survive in America. Both these songs go together so I'm going to tackle both of them right here. This is the closer of the album and it certainly feels like it. It's not exactly triumphant but it is optimistic despite it's dour lyrics about not knowing your place in the world. Justin Vernon returns here and gives one of the best performances of his career. The mix of lyrics such as, ""I'm lost in the world, I'm down on my mind. I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind."" gives a feeling of escape. A feeling of trying to break free from his own demons that have been dragging him down. It feels like an ascension. A turning of the page in Kanye's life into something new. The song gracefully shifts into Who Will Survive in America, which is simply the Lost in the World instrumental played under a Gil Scott-Heron poem about many of the themes brought up in the album. The poem paints a bleak outlook for Kanye’s future all while asking is all the decadence of fame and fortune worth it? What do we lose in the process? And does it really make a difference in the end? It's haunting, scared and open ended enough to make an impact on you long after finishing the album. It doesn't claim to have all the answers to the question it asks. It's merely here to project an image of where Kanye West was at this point of his life. An image of a man being smothered in a house which he willingly built himself; desperately wanting rescue but would probably decline help if someone showed up to help. And nearly ten years later, we find ourselves almost back in the same place. \------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- # Overview My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was almost immediately hailed as a masterpiece and one of the most deep and introspective journeys into the mind of a megastar this century. Unless something comes out in the next month, it will be the only album to receive a perfect 10/10 by Pitchfork this entire decade. Rolling Stone Magazine just named it their best album of the decade, and not many other decade end lists have it outside of the top 10. It's almost haunting looking back to this album now; knowing that if anything this album made him a bigger megastar than ever. This album is the turning point for a lot of people. The moment where the old Kanye became the new Kanye. It's safe to say that his career survived the scandal and that his place as an A list celebrity was secure. He would go on to make many more albums, and make an ass out of himself many more times. Love him or hate him My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy continues to be his most self reflective work. I know many people who can't stand the man but will give him this one album out of his whole discography. It's my personal favorite album of his and my personal favorite album of the decade. Looking back on it now makes me kind of sad, seeing as he's still obviously dealing with many of the issues that haunted him ten years ago. But for one moment in time his ego was able to collide with his humility, and give us something truly special. # Discussion Questions 1. How does listening to this album now compare to when it was released in 2010? Has his current wave of controversies made this album hit differently to you? 2. How do you think of the way the features were used on the album? 3. What other personal and introspective albums does My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy remind you of? How are they similar? 4. Do you agree with the amount of lofty praise this album has received? Or do you think it's closer to a 6/10? 5. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was not nominated for album of the year at the 54th Grammy awards despite winning rap album of the year. The nominees were Loud by Rihanna, Doo-Wops and Hooligans by Bruno Mars, Born this Way by Lady Gaga, Wasting Light by the Foo Fighters, and 21 by Adele. Do you agree with this decision? Or do you think it was wrongfully snubbed.",
739,"Growing painsNew here & to Kundalini, have only in the past few weeks starting looking into this in earnest. After going through the wiki and FAQs feeling like I should put it all out there so there’s a clear timeline of my spiritual evolution that’s led me to look into Kundalini now. My Background: I’ve struggled with “mental health” issues since childhood- depression, anxiety, ADD. That along with social & religious conditioning basically forced me on a path to heal myself out of desperation for relief & to fit in. I went the western way first, started with meds as an easy fix. That started a cycle of small breakdowns over 5 years that got more frequent & intense- Psych ward stints, being extremely over medicated & little to no therapy. Often Changing diagnoses including adding bipolar, mood disorder & borderline personality disorder as the final diagnosis. I started listening to guided meditations & binaural beats and dipping my toe into yoga and flotation sessions halfway through those 5 years to improve my performance in college. I’m convinced this did more good than beyond my original intention. After 3 nearly back to back acute psych ward stints summer 2017, desperate for a deep spirituality and fulfillment through Christianity at the time since it was all I knew, darkness was closing in on me. After that last diagnosis wherein I was harshly told what I thought I had been fighting for years was not a “chemical imbalance/illness” but a personality disorder I could no longer keep it together. My flight response took over. I quit my second college attempt, my job, left my apt without telling the complex a thing and left the hometown I had previously been so hesitant but yearning to get out of. Spent a month out of state visiting with my sister’s family. after nearly 10 years on my own went back to live with my parents even though I was already aware my traumas were directly linked to them. Looking back I can see now how important that flight response really was for me. My parents were in year 4 of immigrating to Canada and had just moved to what I consider a slice of heaven or officially the Okanagan. It was not long before those initial childhood traumas started resurfacing. I went to a trauma workshop led by a darling being who has now been my holistic counselor for the last year & a half. After seeing my intense open mindedness at this point in my self work she encouraged me to get involved with several likeminded groups and circles she was a part of. This coincided with a newfound love for nature & the outdoors that I’d never had before. I had never met such lovely people like this back in South Texas. Not to say they were perfect or anyone back home was terrible but the contrast opened up a whole new space in my healing vortex to really start releasing trauma and integrating my shadows. Reliving the invalidation and toxic home life I worked so hard to separate from along with my first ever toxic job was wearing me down. Hearing my 10 year old sister say things like homosexual people go to hell & hearing a taped sermon on the living room tv from my bedroom spouting horrific things about homosexuality was too much for this still closeted bisexual to bear. That along with working on trauma release caused one last breakdown. my first suicide attempt when previously I would check myself in before trying anything. I purposely overdosed on my mood stabilizer/antipsychotic med after a trivial argument with my father. Compared to US psych wards, the Canadian ward was horrific for me. I was in and out of it the whole time. Once stabilized enough to move to a room it wasn’t long before I managed to let them release me. I hardly remember those 2 days, I wasn’t even fully sober from the overdose when I left. That experience made me no longer fear death nor a legalistic Christian God. The fact I failed at death created a new appreciation for life and authenticity. I traded pharmaceuticals for cannabis opened doors of awareness and joy I had no clue where possible. I stopped letting my mother’s narcissistic codependency cloud my judgement. got my own place with awesome roommates in a gorgeous home minutes from the beautiful beach up there. I finally started getting into the spiritual practices I was drawn to as a child, specifically witchcraft as well as embracing eastern spiritual concepts and ideas. I did a few cold plunges, started joining my counselor in group sits, going to moon gatherings, spending time outdoors marveling at it’s beauty. It took 30 years before I got to experience what joy, peace, bliss and sincere gratitude felt like. It’s a little over a year now, I’ve moved back to my hometown. I’ve starting actively manifesting my dreams. I joined a lovely group of diverse and eclectic witches, living in a van after 3 years of wishing for it, taking up space and showing up for myself. Now for the PRESENT; I never did & still don’t have any disciplined practice in anything. I’ve continue to enjoy guided meditations & have started trying out ones to reach spirit guides, higher self and higher purpose for more insight. I mainly use YouTube & I have used a few kundalini awakening meditations & binaural tracks without knowing anything about it. The past few weeks I’ve been noticing unexpected spiritual & physical changes. My lucid dreams have been wild, when I drive around in the evenings I frequently see lights flickering like spirit is trying to say something. I’ll occasionally feel like I’m floating when walking & not fully in the physical realm. Sometimes I feel like I’m in a simulation- finding the same characters show up, unsure whether I truly believe in certain spiritual ideas or if I’m more a Jungian & it’s all just archetypes or psychological constructs. Now this spiritual questioning in and of itself isn’t disconcerting to me, What is getting to me is the physical symptoms- sleep and eating needs out of whack, emotional instability at a much more intense level, increased desire to drop everything and follow a spiritual path. I’ve mediated on all this, I feel I’m being called to shamanism but I’ve also been advised to consider kundalini awakening from my witch group and I’ve noticed many similarities between the two. So now my curiosity is peaked. Can I be going through both? Does this tell all lean more to one than the other that I’m not seeing myself? Am I just confused and simply need to remain patient for the answers to come when it’s time? I started using visualization techniques of the serpent rising to integrate & activate my chakras. Finding too much imbalance in my chakras to continue in addition to realizing this is a much more complex endeavor than I had anticipated due to lack of proper research. I’m slightly concerned I may have started a kundalini awakening though as a recovering anxiety sufferer I am not always confident in myself. I’ve started struggling with overwhelm at work from moving up a department in addition to whatever the heck I’m going through right now. I’m either feeling manic & like people are drawn to me or intimidated by me (which doesn’t help that those thoughts have been confirmed by a coworker - though even at that I’m weary to trust because he could be projecting) to easily getting drained, being emotional liable with my interpersonal relationships and having to call in to work because I refuse to numb and want to listen and experience the pain to see what it has to teach me. I’m learning a lot and when the roller coaster straightens out I can get in touch with gratitude and bliss it’s just maybe not the best timing along with a mentally challenging promotion for job I’m now not even sure I want anymore... To all those that made it to the end thank you, I love you dearly. And to anyone who has advice or input to share my gratitude goes out to you for taking the time to respond. 💜",

741,"Sort of an update. Sort of a rant.Some of you may recall me posting before about my sister that I had been raising. I believe I also posted under a different but similar username. The child has been with her mother for over 90 days now. I'm holding it together but slowly cracking. I've seen her briefly once. The mother has now cut off all contact with me because I reported to the Gaurdian Ad Litem concerns that our grandmother shared with me. Essentially the mother has been bringing my sister to our grandma's house on weekends. She's unable to get along with the people she lives with, her cousin, and is having financial difficulties. The GAL told the mother I was the one who raised these concerns. She's blocked me on social media. I've already wrote a strongly worded letter to the GAL and her supervisor and the listed supervisor for the district. Not only for her breach of confidentiality but also because no one cares. She stated what I told her wasn't technically abuse therefore she cant really do anything about it. I went ahead and made a detailed report last night. So, whenever you're feeling like a shit mom, remember that DCF apperently feels it's completely okay for a 5yo to have to live in one bedroom of a home and only eat meals at school and the restaurant mom works at part time. It's okay that reunified with the mother after a rigorous home study that now is falling apart. Mom had two jobs when she did the home study, and the family got along great. It's okay that mom cant afford rent or clothes for the coming winter. Its okay to completely isolate the child from her support structure. The case is still open by the way... As for me, I'm holding it together under a shell poorly. She was so engrained in our life. I haven't touched her room. Its still a bit messy with toys not put away. My now fiance proposed two months before she was returned. Now she won't be in our wedding. I dont even want to have a wedding now. I want to get married. We still have Disney passes. I can't bring myself to go. My fiance got Disney plus so we could watch the Mandalorian. It makes me want to sob. A few of my closest friend were mothers as well, I can't stand to hangout with them because their children just remind me of her. I wanted to have a baby. But now I know the other mother told my sister I was going to have a baby. Before I had said anything about intent. Like I'm going to just replace her. Like I was the one who just casted her aside. I can't even think about that now because I could never let her think that. She doesnt understand because she's 5. Worse, I've started isolating myself. From my friends. From my family. From my partner. I didn't tell him about what Grandma said, because I wanted him to be spared the pain. He has terrible anxiety. I'm maxed out on my antidepressant. Next is going to be adding more drugs. More side effects. I've thought about ketamine infusions. I also dont want to get on anymore medication that I would then have to wean off if I ever did pursue pregnancy. I don't talk to him about how broken I am. It's like I have some fucked up emotional version of the Madonna Whore Conplex. I tell strangers on the internet. Not just here, but my online circle of friends. People I've never met but engrossed myself with daily, sometimes for 10+ hours, in video games so I dont have to face reality. My house is in a state of disarray. Laundry, clean, piled sky high on the couch. Just mess and clutter everywhere. I've ordered from uber eats almost every day of the last month. I did order groceries one day. The refridgerator broke about 5 days later. Our landlord is shit and hadnt responded after 72 hours. I fixed it myself with a 20 dollar part on Amazon. But all my food ruined. All I do is sleep, go to work, play video games. Suicidal thoughts, really just intrusive thoughts, have started popping up. Nothing planned or serious, but simple, "" I wish I was dead, Things would be better off for everyone if I killed myself. "" I didn't have a sunny childhood myself, and I think I developed this underlying fear of showing emotions and being vulnerable because that turned into ammunition where I grew up. I recall coming home from school, walking from the bus stops dragging my feet as slow as possible yet being hurried by the Florida sun. Worrying about what fight I was going to come home to today. My wedding is in 4 months. I have a venue. I have a dress. I have plane tickets to Japan, our dream, but I bought them super early to get a great price. And that's all I have. I know my friends are planning an exquisite bachelorette party. I dread dealing with my family. I'm probably uninviting my sister and I's biological father. I dont have invitations. I did send out save the dates. If it wasn't for the plane tickets being being extremely expensive to cancel, and they were a gift from his mother, I would be postponing until further notice. I know everyone would understand. Even if I paid her back for the plane tickets, I would feel stupid taking off that much time from work for a regular vacation. I'd probably be miserable because I'd think about the wedding I cancelled. So yeah. If you've read this far, thanks. Sincerely. I just have to get it all out and this is the safest place for me right now. My friend said she spoke with her therapist, psychologist, about getting me an appointment asap. I guess I'm going to make that phone call now. Edit: I wanted to add, incase my partner find this post, which if he came across it, between the username and the specifica situation he would undeniably recognize me. My partner is the best thing in my life right other than my cats. He has and continues to put up with so much. He's pretty much the only reason there is clean laundry and cat food and clean litter boxes. I wish I could just marry him and run off far away and leave all my shitty life behind, aka all my family and their drama that has literally dragged me down my entire life. Edit #2 I also forgot to mention Frozen 2 is killing me. Frozen was her favorite movie. The advertising is everywhere.",
742,"Turning your Life Around (while living with Depression, Anxiety & Trauma)Hey TAR, I'm writing on here because every other subreddit I've found is full of bootstrappers, trolls and angsty teenagers. I'm not a concise writer so I've bolded important bits :) Thank you to anyone who takes a read and feel free to remove my post if this is the wrong place for this. **I'm looking for advice from other intelligent, highly sensitive or anxious folks who have overcome childhood/teen trauma and learned to live their lives with gratitude and intention.** Going into 2020, I see my life slowly going downhill and I desperately want to change. I have been suicidal in the past and am no longer suicidal. I have, however, lost the desire to live because I can't see a way forward. I desperately want to want to live and desperately want to be more ambitious. **I am hoping that some of you might share your stories of overcoming bad habits, disabilities, lethargy, hopelessness or trauma on your path to a better life.** &#x200B; **A little (a lot) about me:** I'm a 36-year-old man. My friends describe me as funny, thoughtful, charismatic, playful, emotionally intelligent, highly sensitive and a great critical thinker. **When my brain is working, I can be very engaging, dynamic and wonderful to be around. When it is not, it is hard to be present in the most basic way**. I feel physically and mentally exhausted and foggy. Sometimes the most basic task can spiral me into a disassociative state and I nearly pass out. *Challenges -* I have struggled with **ADHD, depression, and anxiety for most of my life**, especially in the last ten years. I am a recovering video-game addict (i used to play for upwards of 12hrs+ a day for over 6 years. I am a child to immigrant parents who moved around a lot which messed with my social skills and general ability to connect with people. I faced and witnessed a lot of subtle, and not so subtle, abuse in my family growing up. I have been working on my deeply seeded insecurities and abandonment issues for over ten years. I lash out at people, fear losing them regularly and struggle to maintain friendships. I have undergone probably 100+ hours of therapy at this point with varying degrees of success. *Strengths -* I am also **proud to have overcome my greatest fears**. I used to think I was just a stupid highschool dropout and my greatest fear was school. This year, I finished a degree in Anthropology with the highest GPA in my faculty. I used to be terrified of water and can now swim fairly comfortably in the ocean. I am terrified of being the centre of attention. I have taken many workshops and now have facilitated workshops and even performed in front of a (small) group of people. I know a good deal about facilitation, collaboration, and organizing events. I am deeply knowledgeable about issues related to (toxic) masculinity, immigration, and know a decent amount about various healing modalities (somatics, CBT, emotion-centred therapy, yoga, meditation, qi gong). *Challenges (career) -* **I have never worked a job that has required me to use my brain, and I desperately want to**. For most of my life, I have worked as a landscaper, general labourer, or driver. I struggle a great deal with organizing my time and task prioritization. **I often get over-focused on the wrong thing, or can barely focus at all and feel really checked out when there's a mentally difficult task in front of me**. I was able to succeed in academia because most of the work happens on your own timeline (and I was fortunate to both have flexible teachers and be a bright student). I have ADHD medication I can take but because I am so highly sensitive medication tends to take me on emotional rollercoasters, so I try not to take it. Anti-depressants are not an option. I have tried three kinds with horrible results. **Where I am now and what I want help with:** Starting in the new year I will need to find new work. Over the past six months, I have been getting increasingly and more severely depressed. My head is a total mess. The things that help me feel less hopeless are: \- keeping my room clean \- meditating (really hard for me bcz of the ADHD but helps a lot) \- eating well (i'm pretty good with this) \- recording positive affirmations and listening to them in the morning \- spending time with friends (rather than self-isolating, giving into negative thinking and pushing people away) \- taking time to look at jobs (rather than watching tv for hours and feeling ashamed) I have considered taking up boxing or taekwando or joining a class for drawing. Just something to get myself feeling productive and moving my body and less lethargic. Career-wise, I have no idea where to start. **I feel so capable. I think that if I actually got a job that helps people and maybe requires some critical thinking I would thrive (after a while) and the joy of the work would actually decrease my anxiety/depression a lot. But how do you get there when you are as severely depressed and anxious as I have been for most of the last year?** If anyone has actually made it through all of this, thank you so much for taking the time to read through where I'm at in my life. It really means a lot.",
743,"100 years ago, two women, both aspiring performers, were murdered within a year of each other in New York City. Who killed these two flappers?Link to full video: [https://youtu.be/iFnqey6fxrA](https://youtu.be/iFnqey6fxrA) (recommended if you want to see pictures of the victims and suspects in addition to archival footage from the time.) &#x200B; **The Broadway Butterfly Murders** In the 1920s, few lights in the world burned brighter than those that lit the Great White Way. From dancers to comedians, pianists to models to playwrights, Broadway was the dream destination of almost every type of entertainer. Unfortunately, making it to the stage did not come with a great deal of security. There were no guarantees of success or safety. This week on Out of the Past: Dorothy King and Louise Lawson: The Broadway Butterfly Murders. Louise Lawson was born at the turn of the twentieth century in Walnut Springs, Texas. Even as a child, she wowed locals with her many talents. Lou, as she preferred to be called, was considered a piano prodigy, playing virtuosic level pieces by the time she was twelve. Her singing voice was also revered in Walnut Springs, and she sang with her church choir every Sunday until she turned 18. After that she left her family and supporters in Texas behind, with hopes of making it in New York City. She planned to study music and pursue her dream of making it to Broadway. Unfortunately, being a big fish in a tiny pond doesn’t always ensure success when that fish migrates to the Big Apple. Not to say that Lou was a failure; she simply didn’t achieve the level of stardom she was seeking. Her biggest break came in early 1921 when she was cast in Florenz Ziegfeld’s Follies. It had been six years since she moved to New York, and she had finally made it to the Broadway stage, earning a living wage. I can’t find much information about what exactly Lou’s role in the production entailed. I assume she was a chorus girl, as I think sources would mention if she performed any sort of solo routine. Keep in mind the Broadway musical was a very different art form a hundred years ago. This was still the age of Vaudeville, and Broadway shows took the form of what we might consider variety shows today. The Ziegfeld Follies productions were famous for their beautiful women. Ziegfeld Girls were the supermodels of their time. So Lou made it to Broadway, but not the way she intended. She wasn’t singing solos or playing the piano. For all intents and purposes, she was a model—part of the background. She also appeared in a D.W. Griffith movie, *Way Down East*, in 1920. She was only an extra, but is clearly visible in the film. The show biz gig didn’t actually last long for Lou, primarily because she soon figured out that she could make a far better living using talents other than the ones that brought her to the city in the first place. After opting to perform in more “private” settings, her life changed dramatically. Keeping the company of wealthy men, many of whom were involved in bootlegging operations, boosted her income from $75 a week to more than $500. Her striking good looks and Texan charm became very popular among crowds of big spenders. As a result, she lived a lavish lifestyle. Friends described her as dripping with jewels and always having cash on hand. Her newfound wealth was no secret in the society she associated with, and in all likelihood was probably something her assailant or assailants would have known about. On the eighth of February, 1924, Louise Lawson was found dead in her own West 77th Street apartment. Lou’s maid discovered her with her arms tied to the corners of her bed with her dog’s leash. She was wearing very little clothing, and was gagged elaborately with towels and tape. Texie, her dog, was found shut up in another room. Texie had apparently always been a very vocal dog, but none of the neighbors reported hearing barking on the night of Lou’s death. The maid called for help, but Lou was already dead upon the doctor’s arrival. The physician on the site was easily able to classify the manner of death as homicide, but I’ve seen conflicting information about the actual cause. Some sources report that she suffocated on her elaborate gag, while others claim she was strangled. One detail that remains consistent, however, is that there was ample evidence of a struggle. Lou fought back. Police concluded that nearly $20,000 worth of jewelry had been stolen from the apartment. The place was in shambles, and authorities could only describe it as “ransacked.” There was a coded message written on her front door. Authorities deciphered the message: “Louise Lawson is alone so long.” Neither this message nor any other forensic clues law enforcement picked up at the scene helped them to solve this grisly murder. In fact, the case went cold almost immediately. Authorities seemed to give up and blame the murder on her lifestyle. They did this with full knowledge that another woman, a former Broadway performer and popular figure in the same crowds Lou ran with, had been murdered just eleven months prior. The two victims had a lot in common, especially when it came to the circumstances around their deaths. Dorothy “Dot” King, real name Dorothy Keenan, hadn’t migrated to the big city like Louise. She was born in Harlem in 1894, but she set her sights on Broadway at an early age. To be more precise, she set her sights on the upper west side of Manhattan and the lifestyle that went with it. Dot began her career as a model. Just like Broadway, modeling was very different a hundred years ago. Dot didn’t strut down a runway in the latest fashions, but rather wore outfits around actual haute couture shops so customers could see what the clothing looked like on a real human body. The job demanded that the employee conform to a set of beauty standards, but they were, of course, different from today’s. She wasn’t a six-foot-tall gazelle. Dot was petite and buxom, and she quickly became one of the most admired beauties in the wealthy cliques of Manhattan. She associated with very powerful men—men who didn’t always have the best intentions. Men who valued money more than human life. With such associations, it was easy for Dot King to leave her Broadway aspirations behind. She was soon drowning in more money than she could ever have imagined as a child in Harlem. She was an unmarried woman living a life of luxury. Dot was New York City’s eminent flapper. With her short blond bob and blue eyes the size of saucers, she was always extravagant in some way. It was people like Dot and the company she kept that kept the twenties roaring. Prohibition and the wild lifestyle fostered by the bootleggers who defied it made her nightlife experiences exciting and sometimes dangerous. Bootlegging brought in great money, and it attracted some of the most apathetic, sociopathic, and dangerous figures of the generation. These men made the most money, so obviously, Dot wanted to run in that crowd. She had a number of beaus, including the son of President Harding, reportedly. Dot King was a prime example of a flapper, but that’s not the only 20s vocabulary she’s associated with. The term “sugar daddy” was coined by Daily News columnist Julia Harpman during this time, possibly in direct reference to Dot’s case. Dot’s favorite daddy was a man she would only ever refer to as “Mr Marshall.” Mr Marshall put her up in a nice apartment on 57th Street: the top floor of a brownstone. This was where her maid, Billy Bradford, discovered her body sprawled across the bed in a filmy nightie on March 15, 1923. Bradford didn’t even realize she was dead at first. Dot was a nightly partier, so Bradford simply assumed she had passed out from another long evening at the local speakeasies. Bradford went along with her business, tidying up the room, until she accidentally brushed Dot’s foot. It was like ice. Before contacting the authorities, Bradford tampered with the crime scene extensively. The window was open when she arrived, and she closed it, in all likelihood to make herself more comfortable in the apartment. There had been record-breaking low temperatures the previous night. What I can’t think of a way to explain is why Bradford cleaned so much before authorities arrived. She washed drinking glasses with fingerprints on them. She also found a pair of men’s pajamas and stashed them underneath the couch. Some suggest that she did this to protect Dot’s reputation, but we don’t know for sure. Friends and neighbors traipsed around the apartment for hours before authorities had a chance to survey it for evidence. Of course, forensic sciences were in their infancy at the time. Even if it had been perfectly preserved, it’s unlikely that the prosecution would have found their suspects using forensic evidence from the crime scene. Murder wasn’t the first conclusion that people jumped to. The first doctor who arrived at the scene thought it was an accidental overdose or a suicide. Chloroform was used as a recreational drug back then, and a bottle was found beside her. Dot wouldn’t have been the first party girl to have used chloroform to take her own life. It wasn’t until another professional examined the body that authorities learned that it was absolutely a homicide. Dr. Charles Casassa pointed out that Dot’s arm had been bent into an unnatural position behind her back. The back side of her body was also covered in bruises. There were marks around her neck, like she’d been strangled. He notified the chief medical examiner, Dr. Charles Norris, who didn’t arrive until 6PM. (Norris’ autopsy determined that there was no alcohol in Dot’s system, and that she had not engaged in sexual activity.) Detectives arrived even later. Law enforcement seemed to be dragging their feet for some reason. The apartment had been burglarized and ransacked. Authorities estimated that she was missing about $15,000 in jewelry. This is one of the many details that have been used to connect Dot’s and Lou’s murders. They were both women living in fancy apartments alone, who were in possession of a fortune’s worth of jewels. They ran with similar crowds: the crowds that could afford this kind of jewelry, obviously, and many wealthy people in the 1920s did not come into their money through ethical means. The only person who had observed anything unusual during the time Dot would have been assaulted was a downstairs neighbor who reported hearing noises above them and smelling a terrible odor coming from the dumbwaiter. Could this dumbwaiter have been used as a way to get to the apartment? Was the smell the chloroform that was used on Dot? There was also very likely a roof garden above Dot’s room, which might have provided access as well. Another significant piece of potential evidence uncovered at the site was Dot’s will, found on a table. It began “I, Dorothy Keenan, believing that something unforeseen might happen to me, hereby bequeath all my worldly possessions to my mother.” I don’t think the murders of Lou and Dot are linked by a single killer, but I do think it’s important to talk about them together because their life circumstances were so similar, and people used their circumstances in order to prey on these young women. Whereas Louise Lawson’s murder went cold pretty quickly, several suspects stood out in the Dorothy King case. One of these suspects was the mysterious figure at first known only as “Mr. Marshall”—probably even by Dot herself. Mr. Marshall, as I’ve said, was Dot’s main squeeze, her “sugar daddy.” He was the one who supposedly paid for her living expenses, including the apartment in which she was murdered. He was extravagantly wealthy, and chose to shower Dot with that wealth in the form of jewelry, flowers, champagne, and savings bonds. He was also the owner of the pajamas that Dot’s maid had stashed under the sofa. Mr. Marshall would always arrive at Dot’s apartment with his associate, “Mr Wilson.” Mr Wilson appears to have served as a lookout. After checking to see if the coast was clear, he would escort Mr. Marshall to the elevator where he would tip the operator (a man from the West Indies named John Thomas) for his discretion. Keeping his relationship with Dot a secret was clearly a priority for Mr. Marshall. Mr. Marshall had taken Dot out to dinner on the last night of her life, and they dined as a trio with Mr. Wilson. (Some sources claim that Dot and Mr. Wilson were closer than they let on. If they were having an affair with each other, this could have provided a motive for Mr. Marshall—or, conceivably, for Mr. Wilson.) A short time after the murder, law enforcement received an anonymous phone call from a woman stating that she was in possession of a love letter sent to Dot by one of her many admirers. “Darling Dottie, only two more days and I will be in your arms. I want to see you. O so much, and to kiss your pretty toes,” it said. The anonymous caller told the police that the man who wrote it was one of the most powerful men in the country. When the author of the letter came forward, investigators finally learned the identity of the mysterious Mr. Marshall. He was actually Philadelphia businessman John Kearsley Mitchell, the son-in-law of E. T. Stotesbury, who was a close associate of J.P. Morgan. “Mr. Wilson” was Mitchell’s lawyer friend John H. Jackson. Investigators began to pursue Mitchell as a person of interest. Some conjectured that Dot had tried to blackmail him in some way, so he’d had her taken care of. But Mitchell, though he admitted to penning the letter, and to having dinner with Dot before she was murdered, denied having a romantic relationship with her. He claimed he was happily married, and his wife was always there to confirm that. Of course, it seems like a fair question to ask why Mitchell was so eager to kiss the toes of someone with whom he was “just good friends.” And then there are the pajamas! At any rate, Dot’s mother, Kate Keenan, didn’t think the “Mr. Marshall” path was the right one to follow. She didn’t think Mr. Marshall would hurt a soul. She wanted the police to look into another one of her daughter’s boyfriends, a gigolo named Albert Guimares. Guimares was an all-around bad guy. He swindled innocent people into investing in bogus stocks. He was known to run with the mob and there were warrants out for his arrest. The evidence also indicates that Dot was complicit in his fraudulent investment schemes: she had a list of “suckers” in her apartment. Most damningly, he had allegedly beaten Dot up just a few nights before her death. Dot’s mother was certain he was the killer, but he had an alibi that could be corroborated by several witnesses, including someone the media simply referred to as “an attractive blond.” The case sat open for years, and law enforcement kept an eye on Guimares. Years later, the identity of the “attractive blond” surfaced, and along with it new information to investigate. There had been two witnesses that alibied Guimares in the original investigation: Guimares’ best friend Edmund McBrien, and this blond, whose identity was finally revealed as McBrien’s girlfriend, Aurelia Fischer. Six years later, as the decade was coming to an end, Fischer and McBrien attended a posh party in Washington D.C. At one point during the night, Fischer took to the balcony for some fresh air. She never came back inside. She either jumped or was pushed. It was revealed soon afterward that she had recently confessed to family members: “I perjured myself in the Dot King murder.” Some wonder whether O’Brien pushed her to her death in order to prevent her from disclosing Guimares’ role—or his own—in Dot’s murder. One surprising suspect law enforcement looked into was Draper Daugherty, the son of the nation’s Attorney General. He was nowhere near Manhattan at the time of the crime, but the media took quite an interest in this famous, married suspect. It made for good headlines. Another person of interest was up-and-coming Broadway performer Hilda Ferguson, who had been Dot’s roommate until just a few weeks before the murder. They were close, even sharing a bed when they lived together. Dot took Hilda to all her usual clubs and speakeasies and introduced her to rich, powerful men. Soon, Hilda was arm candy to Willie McCabe, one of mob giant Arnold Rothstein’s cronies. (Hilda was supposedly in Central Park the night Rothstein was slain.) As Hilda gained notoriety, she became more successful professionally, making it to Broadway as a Ziegfeld girl. (She didn’t get to enjoy her success for long, though. She died at the end of the twenties at the age of 30.) Hilda eventually moved out of the apartment, claiming that Dot’s partying and drinking was too much for her. According to a lot of other people, however, Hilda’s lifestyle was if anything even wilder than Dot’s. Just days before the murder, there was a report of an altercation between Dot and an unidentified woman on the street. A blogger named Brooks Peters has speculated that this might have been Hilda, who had moved to a building not far away. It’s not clear why Hilda would have been angry enough at Dot to attack her, let alone kill her, but there is at least a slight possibility that their falling out could have been bitter enough to cause bad blood. Other suspects some have proposed are Dot’s older brother John, who often slutshamed her and didn’t approve of her flapper lifestyle, and her ex-husband Eugene Oppel, whom she referred to as “a big bum.” There is no real evidence that either of them was involved in her death, however. Brooks Peters proposes on his blog An Open Book that the answer to Dot’s mystery could actually lie in the history of the brownstone in which she was murdered. I’ve gotten a great deal of my information about Dot from Peters’ research, which is extensive and fascinating. It’s also overwhelming and at times bewildering. His findings involve several decades’ worth of real estate purchases and development plans, with a huge cast of characters ranging from the obscure to the rich and famous. How any of it relates to Dot or her murder is pretty vague, but it’s definitely interesting and worth checking out. The most striking thing Peters comes across is a strange coincidence that seems too weird to be accidental. Two of Dot’s neighbors in her building, in two different apartments, were named Frances Stoddard and Robert Sanborn. Dot and Guimares were known to have been involved in some pyramid schemes together wherein they duped investors out of large amounts of cash. According to one news article, they even had an office in the Giske Building downtown with a fake name that they used as a cover. The name was “Stoddard & Sandborn.” The most likely explanation is that when they were trying to come up with a name for their front, Dot or Guimares just thought of these names because they were handy: maybe they were printed on mailboxes in the lobby of the building, for example. But if the real Stoddard and Sanborn were somehow caught up in their shenanigans, say as investors or partners, this could have provided one or both of them with a motive for violence when they discovered they’d been tricked. It wouldn’t be the first time such a thing had happened: about a year earlier, another of Dot’s and Guimares’ “suckers” had accosted her in a club. So these are two mysteries that will probably never be solved. In my opinion, these cases are not connected by an assailant, but rather by a lifestyle that attracted predators. In the Lawson case, there are several questions that leave me guessing. If you have any theories, please leave a comment below. 1. What did the coded writing on the door mean? Was it supposed to be “Louise Lawson is alone. So long”? If not, how do we explain the grammar of the sentence? In either case, how do we determine its meaning? And how reliable was the method used to decipher it? 2. Did Lou have a particular sugar daddy who was able to deflect interest off of himself? It seems the apartment she was living in was even fancier than Dot’s. Could he have had a key? 3. The tying and the gagging make me wonder if this could be the work of a serial killer. It seems ritualistic and rehearsed, but the house was also more burglarized than many serial killer crime scenes. Remember, whoever did it made off with more than $20,000 in jewelry. It could have been someone Lou knew, or an unknown/possible serial intruder. We don’t have enough information to rule either one out. As for Dot King’s case, other questions bother me. * Why is there so much misinformation out there? It seems like many of the details that are commonly reported are completely made up. We don’t even know that Dot was ever on Broadway, for there was another Dorothy King trying to make it at the same time. Some hold she never made it to the Great White Way. * Why did police think that they could accurately survey the apartment for stolen valuables after so many people had rummaged through the house already? It is rumored that Dot had much less than 15K in jewels stolen, and that some of her family members actually came in and took things they considered to be theirs now. * What was going on with Dot’s will, which was found at the scene of the murder? What sort of “unforeseen” thing could she have had in mind? Did she know someone wanted her dead? And why? Why was it just sitting out in plain sight and not filed away? Is it possible that Dot’s own mother forged it and planted it? And if so, to what further degree might she have been involved in the whole thing? * Why were they able to pin so many other crimes on Guimares, but not this one? Why wasn’t he arrested after the deathbed confession of Aurelia? They call them Broadway butterflies because they’re young women so transfixed by the lights of Broadway, they must move toward them, like moths to lightbulbs. But these women were no moths. They were so beautiful and extravagant, we have to change the analogy to butterfly. Dot and Lou flew so close to the lights that they took on their glow themselves. The lights burned so bright in these women that they couldn’t be blown out completely. That’s why I’m still telling their stories a hundred years later. Regardless of their own involvement in various crimes, what happened to them was wrong, and they deserved better.These were strong, talented women who could have contributed so much more to society if their lives weren’t cut short. Everyone always said Dot King could make your day with a smile. Why would someone want to take that smile away? &#x200B; Link to [blog post](https://brookemicheller.wixsite.com/mysite/post/the-broadway-butterfly-murders) [Brooks Peter's blog](http://brookspeters.blogspot.com/2012/02/death-of-flapper-dot-king-scandal.html), if you want to jump even farther down the rabbit hole. &#x200B; Thanks for reading!",
744,"No, seriously, what do you do when you realise your parent tried to kill you cold-blooded?It was some 10 years ago. Fair enough, I was saved by a very compasionate gypsy family who called me an ambulance. I never understood why they were always so happy to see me alive after that. I didn't realize that she had tried to kill me with that haloperidol overdose she put in my food. That she intentionally left me alone on the street after that. She left me for dead. Then she pretended I had tried to commit suicide. I didn't acknowledge her intentions for more than 10 years. I remembered everything clearly, but somehow didn't try to put myself in her shoes to understand what she really wanted: the mentally ill, disgraceful daughter dead. Now I don't know what to do with myself. It hurts, I am nauseated and angry, I don't even know what else. Please help. I know not many people have lived through something like this, I know it sounds incredible, stuff of nightmares or made up, but this is where I am and I need any kind of support. I now understand why I would've needed a therapist on my way to healing. Memories will turn against you when you didn't process them. The closer you are to healing, the heavier realisations you are able to have. How to deal with them and still function? That's the stuff no one actually told me. Edit: just to clarify: this happened when I was in Uni, which is more than 10 years ago. I was not a child, I was a young woman visiting her family after a semestre of study. Sorry for having been unclear there.",
745,"Severe abuse broke me, but I am recoveringMy father is a sober man, but for all intents and purposes he was always drunk on his ego. A rampant narcissist and borderline psychopath, my father is responsible for most of my suffering in life. Certainly, I take responsibility for my fair share of personal shortcomings, but we live in a world of cause and effect relationships. The roots of child abuse run deep, and they form a tangled web in my psyche that has led to me being a homeless recovering addict with a colorful spectrum of mental health problems. One of my first memories is being thrown across the room when I was four. I don’t remember why I was tossed like a ragdoll, but I distinctly remember sipping my juice box while my mom talked with the police officer at the front door. I feel obligated to share the strength of this memory, because my father would later deny these events ever happened. Gas-lighting is common for him - he routinely chooses his ego over family, which was apparent as I tried to bridge the gap between us on my spiral down to the streets.I’ve decided to go no contact with him after recent outreach attempts have returned the same condescending, compassionless responses. When I asked for fatherly advice while feeling desperate and suicidal, he had little more to say than “don’t kill yourself,” and “get your shit together.” It is that lack of loving care that I desperately wanted my whole life, without ever realizing that it was his approval I needed more than anything. Instead, I lived for vengeance, as I saw my father as the personification of pure evil. In the beginning stages of my schizoaffective symptoms (though I wouldn’t know anything was wrong until later), I created and believed a whole mythology of how I was a god who was tormented by my deity of a father for being imperfect - a perfect mirror to what was going on in my real life. After my mother died when I was nine, I was left with my father who began dating again. I remember my life was divided into sagas, where each new person he brought into my life waxed and waned, as he could only keep up the appearance of being a saintly widower caring for his son/daughter (I’m mtf trans but didn’t know until much later in life) for so long. His mood would reflect the state of his relationships, and his abuse, both physical and emotional, would ramp up to extreme levels when things weren’t going right for him. For instance, when I was ten, his second major relationship was starting to turn rocky. During this time, the water line burst in our basement. While he was hauling the water up, he asked if I had done my homework. As it was a Saturday, I hadn’t. I had no idea why he asked outside of giving him an excuse to pummel me. You see, after berating me for being lazy, he got furious with me and soon we were on the floor. He was over me, smashing my head into the linoleum of the kitchen floor. This happened several times as afterwards I had to help get the door for him while doing my homework. Naturally, my hands were shaking and I slammed the door open trying to be as efficient as he wanted me to do. Soon after all the water was drained, his girlfriend called and he was calm again. We went out to dinner with her sons that night like nothing ever happened. When I was eleven, his future ex-wife left for a darts tournament. I suspect something was amiss around this time, because my father was in a really sour mood. I tried to avoid him by playing video games, but this just pissed him off more. During this time, I eventually forgot to take out the trash from the kitchen, which led to him dragging my by the leg to my room, punching it and making me think he was going to break it. He didn’t, but he picked me up, shook me, and began smashing my head into the back of my door, breaking that instead. After throwing me to the ground and telling me to lay there like a dog, he proceeded to clear out my shelves - which contained everything my mom had ever made me - in two rabid sweeps of him arms. I laid there, completely frozen in shock, as he cleaned up the mess he made. When he finished and was about to go to the dump, he made me stand. I would continue standing perfectly still for the remainder of the day until I passed out some 8-10 hours later. During this time, he would come to me and ask if I had anything to say. I tried coming up with an apology for being selfish and not thinking of his needs during this time, but nothing I said was good enough. Near the end of the day, he would begin lecturing me and insinuate I was a horrible human being for choosing to play video games when my mom was close to death. That sort of psychological torture was common. In high school, I would become bulimic because I was not good enough for him in track, despite owning half of our school’s record board and competing on a national level. There was a time when I was practicing three times a day, once in the morning, and then twice back to back in the evening. He was living vicariously through me, as self-evident by the fact that he still has all the rewards I earned plastered on the walls of his living room. When I failed, he failed, and that was not tolerated. He wasn’t mad, he was livid, a fact he repeated many times as he shit in my soul for nights at a time. On top of this, everything I did was criticized and I was belittled for the smallest things. Once I cut my hair the way I wanted, which really wasn’t that different than how it was before, and I didn’t hear the end of it for weeks. He still stalks me on social media, but while I still lived in his house, most anything I posted was met with a sarcastic comment or at least something letting me know he was watching everything I was doing. That sort of hyper-obsessive and vile watching eye is what led to me living in denial of my identity for so long. In fact, for the longest time, It has felt like I had a dead limb attached to my psyche, there but unable to be interacted with. Now, it feels like my masculine and feminine energies are like oil and water. I’m still healing and mending who I am, so eventually this may change, but right now I’m stuck in a nonbinary state that is ever-changing. Additionally, I live in a slipstream of synchronicities. I like to say being schizoaffective is like being bipolar, but the aliens are constantly abducting me in order to protect me from the CIA, who is creating a reality TV show around my life. Every day it feels like the universe is sending me messages, most of which revolve around me not being good enough and that I need to improve. It’s not hard to see how my psyche was molded over time to perpetually trap me in a reality built of the quicksands of negative self-image. Still, I’m in an infinitely better place than where I once was. I’ve been sober for a few months now, and while there are moments of weakness where I feel I may use again, I have a greater sense of a mission on this planet that is guiding me toward brighter futures. I may be homeless, but the experiences I’ve had on the streets have been the most radically transformative of my life. I feel infinitely more independent than I once was. My core philosophy is that free will is a skill - if we walk down a new road every day eventually we will be able to navigate to any destination. If we are regularly pushing our boundaries, we cannot help but step outside our comfort zone and expand as a person. Having no stability has forced me to recondition myself, opening new doors and avenues for myself moving forward. I’m so much more calm and present than I once was. Even though my emotions are still a roller coaster, it feels more like a kids ride now, and at the very least I have stopped self-harming since being on this new concoction of medications. I am hopeful for the future. More importantly, I am grateful for the present. Being grateful changes everything in our perspective; it is like wearing glasses to see the world through a different lens. I may have traveled through some harsh roads growing up, but if I didn’t I would not be who I am right now. Every experience is a blessing, and we are all here to enjoy the ride of our lives. The highs would be meaningless without the lows, and there are so many small moments of joy to be found in every day. There is only up from here, and I want to bring some of the light I have found into others’ lives. I hope you found something meaningful in my story, and I hope you have many bright days ahead of you.",
746,"Cryopod Refresh 207: Rosalia's DesireHaving lived on Tarus II for a few weeks now, I've come to regard it with the utmost suspicion. Who can blame me? Before I came here, I never liked humans. I always thought they were smelly, weak, and, most importantly, _rude_. Now, I can say with the utmost confidence that humans are a thousand times worse than I ever imagined! It's no wonder we demons wouldn't let them become more civilized. Look at all the weird things they build! As I walk down the 'street' of a human city, I raise my eyes toward one of the many similarly-designed buildings within view, one that does not look cute at all. If I had to describe it, I'd say it was a giant square and nothing more! Unlike the beautiful houses and mansions at Hell Harbor, each with an architect's artistry touching them, the capital of humanity's military is instead filled with ugly and crude structures, designed for function over aesthetics. Weird. That's how I've come to describe humans. Upon my arrival, they immediately assigned me a job, and I had no say in it! Who takes a look at such a fair and beautiful demoness as me and decides I should be a cleaner of bedpans? Who gazes upon me, Rosalia, Beelzebub's former bed-warmer, and concludes I should assist that damned traitorous Second Emperor in sticking thermometers in mouths? Hmph! I hate living among humans. Whenever I walk past a male, he will, without fail, gaze at me with eyes-wide-open, as if he cannot believe such a gorgeous specimen would occupy the same space as he! His lecherous gaze strips me from head to toe. His tongue lolls out of his mouth, and his eyes water, likely from imagining how one night with me would change his life forever. But no! I won't accept any man in my life besides Mister Beelzebub! He's the only man for me. After I break the mind control of that damned floozy, that worthless Ose, I'll have him for myself! Finally, he'll have no choice but to accept the perfection that is me! I'll make him beg for forgiveness. When he next 'fires' me, he'll do so with the utmost passion! He'll- Ah! What the Devil is that?! My heart skips a beat as I stop and stare at a bright-red object embedded in the 'sidewalk.' The object's shape immediately reminds me of several indecent 'tools' I once spotted in a succubus hovel. However, given its size of nearly two feet in height, I can only begin to imagine what sort of gigantic creature would use it to pleasure themselves! Perhaps a minotaur? A gate-troll? A flame wyrm?! Seven Hells! How could someone leave such an inappropriate object on a random street corner? It befuddles the mind! Is this the level of vulgarity the humans have begun teaching to their monster and demon slaves? How dreadful! My cheeks flare up slightly as I imagine what would happen if Mister Beelzebub were to use such a predatory implement upon me. Oh, how helpless I would be! He would ravage me, bend me over his knee, and- ""Ma'am? Ma'am? Are yew alright? You're lookin' at that there water-spitter real weird..."" A voice jars me out of my thoughts. I whirl around to spot a kobold standing next to the sexual torture device. He scratches his head and stares at me in a manner most lewd, causing my cheeks to flush- _Wait,_ what did he say? ""I'm... I'm fine! What did you call this.. this _implement_?"" The kobold raises an eyebrow. ""It's a water-spitter, ma'am. We use it to put out fires. Yew alright? Yew ain't suff'rin heatstroke, are yuh?"" My blood runs cold. ""...To put out fires? That's what this... this lewd object does?"" The kobold nods politely. ""Yes'm. That, it sure does. Did yew need water t'cool off?"" ""Uhm... no. I'm fine. Thank you for your concern, kobold."" The kobold shrugs. ""Suit yerself, missy. It's awful hot this time-o-year. Keep cool now, y'hear?"" The kobold shuffles away, leaving me alone with my thoughts. Immediately, I turn to stare at the so-called 'water-spitter.' ""Hehe. I see. The humans truly are crafty little rats."" A _water-spitter._ Who could believe such a lie? How is this conspicuous red implement supposed to deliver water to something which has caught fire? There are no lakes in the area, nor are there any rivers or oceans. Anyone with half a brain knows the best way to put out a fire is by using water magic! Since humans have no magic at their disposal, they must be deluding the monsters here by claiming they can summon water from thin air! Only someone of high intelligence, such as I, can see through the lies of these vile, disgusting humans. Without a doubt, my initial guess was only slightly off the mark, for this object may not be a water-spitter, but it surely exists to make someone _wet._ Humans cannot fool me with their trickery! I quickly walk past the bright red object, pushing it to the back of my mind. Hopefully, I'll never do anything to incur the humans' wrath, for I shudder to think of all the vile positions they'll make me assume to satisfy their debased desires! Having removed the human's invention from my sight, I turn my gaze westward, toward Hero City's border. There, at the edge of a cliff, the 'General Hospital' stands, all ten stories of it. Just like every other structure, it's nothing more than a big square mashup of brick and stone, held together by whatever sloppy methods the humans use for construction. I never feel even slightly impressed by anything I see on Tarus II since everything human in origin mystifies me with its obtuseness. I work at the hospital. Not willingly, but if I intend to follow Mister Gressil's orders, I have to blend in and act natural amongst all these filthy fleshbags. If that means debasing myself by working as a servant of fleshbags, then so be it! Someday I'll break free and find Mister Beelzebub again. **Hehe. You don't have to follow the flow. You can carve your own path. Isn't that what you want? To become someone incredible, worthy of Beelzebub's interest?** I frown as a familiar female voice speaks within me. Ever since Mister Gressil put his hand against my face and shoved that disgusting, wriggling _thing_ inside my stomach, the entity's voice has spoken to me whenever I start feeling self-doubt. _Desire? What do you want? You always pop up at the worst moments._ I named my inner voice 'Desire,' because she usually talks about what I want. However, her requests always rub me the wrong way. **I don't want anything, Rosalia. I'm a part of you. I merely wish to help you achieve your dreams. Your wishes are my wishes. Is that such a hard concept to understand?** _No, it's not hard to understand... but I don't see why Mister Gressil would put you inside of me. Why would he care what I want?_ **Silly girl. I am a means to an end. Master Gressil has chosen you to be one of his pawns. This is a rare opportunity for you, since someday, Master Gressil will rule the cosmos. He doesn't know it yet, and perhaps he doesn't even wish for such a fate, but his ascension is inevitable. What use has the ruler of all creation for weak, useless creatures like you? You must ascend if you are to serve him properly.** I lower my eyes to stare at the ground. _I'm... I'm not useless. Mister Beelzebub always loved how hard I worked-_ **Fool! Just look at you. It is no wonder Beelzebub cast you away. Why would anyone wish to have a fat, bumbling oaf like you standing at their side? You have to leave behind your weakness and your dependence on others. Only by doing so will you transform into someone worthy of Beelzebub's respect.** A sigh escapes my lips. _But, what you want me to do... is..._ **It's not that difficult. You already hate humans. You loathe them, despise them, and wish for all of them to drop dead. I'm simply offering you the chance to expedite that process. What's the matter? Are you afraid of dirtying your hands?** _No... I'm- I'm not..._ Desire's tone turns haughty. **Bingo. You don't mind if other demons bathe in human blood, but you think yourself above all the 'riff-raff.' You're too good to follow my lead. Very well. I'll stay quiet for a while. Go ahead and play 'House' in Hero City. See what happens when you don't do what I say.** After a moment, Desire fades away, causing me to stumble as I arrive at the entrance to Hero City's hospital. My chest hurts. My eyes sting. I... I've never acted like other demons. When I was an imp, I obtained human souls through manual labor. I sucked up to any Lords I could find and begged them for scraps. The day I earned my hundredth soul and became a grunt, I lucked out by being assigned to Mister Beelzebub. After that, I served him for hundreds of years. Never once did I try to earn any additional souls. I was content to follow in Mister Beelzebub's footsteps. I thought I would always be by his side. But once he became a Duke, Ose seduced him. She forced him to abandon me. Why else would he leave me, his most loyal servant, behind? I can't do what Desire wants. I'm not a killer. I'm not capable of hurting others for my own benefit! I'm a beautiful, shining star. I won't let someone change that part of me. With a belated sigh, I walk up to the doors of the general hospital. They slide open automatically, all thanks to the electrical magic the humans use to power their bizarre inventions. I step inside and turn to the right, where a reception desk stands mere feet away. Seated behind it, a short little goblin, dressed in a pinstriped suit, glances at me. ""Ah, Nurse Rosalia. I trust you enjoyed your lunch break?"" ""Yeah... sort of, Grima."" ""Wonderful. You need to check on rooms three through fifteen in the next twenty minutes, then resume your usual rounds. After that, feel free to use your discretion for the rest of the workday. Doctor Fathy should arrive around noon to assist you."" Grima, the goblin receptionist, smiles at me before returning his attention to a small stack of papers resting on his desk. Unlike other goblins, he's a well-spoken fellow, far more interesting than any stinky human. ""Um... say, Grima... do you think Doctor Fathy has any experience dealing with... with parasites?"" Grima continues reading his notes without looking at me. ""Undoubtedly. Among harpies, she is considered an especially knowledgeable healer. Even Bahamut herself relied on Doctor Fathy's knowledge. Why? Has one of our patients contracted a viral contagion?"" ""Um, no! Nope, not at all. I was just curious, that's all."" Grima flicks his eyes to me for a moment, then returns his gaze to one of the many medical reports on his desk. ""I see. Feel free to ask Doctor Fathy yourself when she arrives. As a new arrival to our facility, you might be a little suspicious of the doctor's medical talents, but I assure you, even the best demon healers find themselves in awe of a Harpie's medical expertise. Now, if you'll excuse me, I do have several forms I need to finish sorting before I may return home."" ""O-okay! Sorry to bother you, Mister Grima, sir."" Feeling slightly embarrassed, I duck away from the goblin, walk over to a wardrobe station, and close the door behind me. It only takes me a few minutes to don my white nurse outfit, one in which I never quite feel comfortable. Why must they make the size so form-fitting? I'm no succubus! I'm supposed to dress like a professional, like I always did for Mister Beelzebub. ... Ten minutes pass. Twenty. Thirty. I wander from room to room, checking on each patient one by one, always grumbling underneath my breath when I have to clean a bedpan or roll over the less lucid patients to get their blood flowing properly. Ever since Belial fell unconscious a few weeks ago, when both of the Wordsmiths left the Core, we haven't had any magical doctors on hand — certainly nobody capable of healing injuries with a flourish of their hands. I had barely even joined the Core before the Wordsmiths ended up leaving. What timing! Mister Gressil probably wanted me to do some secret spy work and keep my eye on one of the Heroes, but they both disappeared! That's my lot in life. I've always been a poor, unlucky idiot. My world is filled with coffee tables, and I can't stop tripping over them. ""Room thirteen, done. Room fourteen..."" I mumble to myself as I leave Old Hallister's room and move on to the second-to-last of my assigned charges, the room belonging to Miss Belial herself. The moment I arrive at the doorway, I fall silent. As always, Miss Belial's demonic energy chokes me with a mixture of excitement and worry. Unascended demons like myself have difficulty fighting our superiors, given the monstrous power they control within themselves. As the Second Emperor of demonkind, Miss Belial is the strongest of us all. Before coming to Tarus II, I'd never once met her in all my life. I only knew her name thanks to rumors passed from imp to imp. Belial is a shapeshifter, one who also possesses incredible healing magic. If that isn't enough, she can also bend and deform her body, almost as if she doesn't have any bones beneath her skin. Her strength surpasses even Mister Bael's, allowing her to crush mountains with a single punch. She's incredible. _She's scary._ I only managed to speak to Miss Belial a few times before the Hydra put her into a coma. She didn't seem mean or vicious, especially compared to that skank, Ose, or Mister Gressil. Still, Miss Belial is an Emperor, and that means if I ever made her angry, she could kill me in the blink of an eye. I've heard that anyone who dares to insult Mister Satan in her presence will suffer immensely. She even beat Mister Bael within an inch of his life, some twenty thousand years ago! That's why I always tread lightly when tending to her needs. Miss Belial might be in a coma, but I can't take any chances. If she wakes up in the future after hearing me say anything _uncouth_... Let's just say I won't be able to see Mister Beelzebub anymore. He'll have to peel me off the side of a mountain! With a heavy heart, I swallow my anxiety, push aside the curtain to the Second Emperor's hospital room, and step inside. Immediately, I freeze in my tracks. Phoebe and Daisy Hiro, the wife and daughter of humanity's commander, stand beside Miss Belial's bed. Phoebe runs her fingers through Miss Belial's hair, while Daisy hops up and down on her feet. Both of them stand with their backs to me. Maybe I can slip out of the room unnoticed. I dread the idea of having to talk to these two disgusting fleshbags. Before I can retreat, Phoebe turns her head slightly and spots me. ""Oh! Rosalia, you're here. I've already taken care of Sammy's needs for today. Daisy helped me give her a sponge-bath, so now you don't have to!"" I swallow my urge to vomit. ""Y-yes. Um, okay! Thanks, I guess."" I quickly turn to leave, only to freeze in my tracks as Phoebe speaks again. ""Hey, now, I made sure to leave you some work. Why don't you water the plants by the windowsill?"" My vision turns red. _Filthy human! How dare she order me around! Argh!!_ However, I take a moment to exhale and breathe out my anger, then turn around and flash a cute, cheerful smile at her. ""Oh, sorry! I misunderstood and thought you'd taken care of everything here! Give me a minute, and I'll get those flowers watered in a jiffy!"" I force my grin to widen even further while hoping the human isn't intelligent enough to notice my eyebrows twitching in rage. If I were only dealing with Phoebe, I wouldn't care, but it's patently _obvious_ the Second Emperor fancies the Hero's spouse. When Phoebe isn't around, Miss Belial always talks about her with stars in her eyes. It takes all of my willpower not to vomit! How can a demon fall for a human? Such a concept sickens me. Miss Belial might pretend her intentions toward Phoebe are platonic, but _nobody_ talks about a mere friend with such revolting, dopey-eyed reverence. Barf! I walk across the room, grab a glass cup, and fill it with water. Within moments, I arrive at the first of six plants lining the edges of each of the room's three windows. ""So, how have you been enjoying your stay in Hero City?"" Phoebe asks. I keep my back to the human so that she won't see me gritting my teeth. ""Oh, you _know_, it's a new experience... haha..."" Even a light chuckle directed at the Hero's Whore makes my entire body tense up. Not only is she a filthy human, but she's the spouse of demonkind's greatest enemy! If I weren't forced into servitude by Mister Gressil, I wouldn't let myself get caught dead within a hundred miles of her! ""Oh, yes, I imagine so,"" Phoebe replies, keeping up the small talk. ""Samantha mentioned you before. She said other demons bullied you because of your looks. I hope you know that we always try to treat everyone equally in Hero City. Jason doesn't like bullies and jerks, after all. Feel free to tell me if anyone hurts you or insults you, alright? I'll straighten them out, lickety-split!"" My eyebrow starts twitching again. _How dare Emperor Belial tell this stupid human the information I relayed to her in confidence?! Besides, nobody ever bullied me! I made all those stories up! Everyone loves me! They can't get enough of my rapturous good looks!_ I turn my head and force myself to smile at Phoebe. ""Y-yes. I'll make sure to do that."" As I look at Phoebe, a movement at her side catches my attention. I can't help but notice Daisy, her daughter, staring at me with a look of absolute concentration. ""Hey! You're lying! Mommy says lying is bad!"" My heart skips a beat. ""What? I beg your pardon!"" Phoebe's polite smile vanishes. She turns to scowl at her daughter. ""Daisy! That's not nice to say. You can't just call someone a liar. Apologize."" Daisy crosses her arms. ""No! She's lying, mommy! The fat lady thinks you're a big meanie!"" Phoebe turns to face her daughter, and her expression turns nasty. ""Daisy Miranda Hiro! That is enough out of you, young lady! Apologize to Nurse Rosalia at once! We do _not_ insult other people's looks in this household!"" Finally, Daisy realizes her mother isn't kidding around. The little girl casts a fearful glance upward and nods her head. ""Uh, uhm... okay..."" She fidgets for a moment before turning back to me. However, she casts her eyes downward, unable to meet my gaze. ""...I'm sorry, Miss Rosie. I shouldn't have called you a fat liar."" ""Daisy!"" Phoebe yells, hissing her words through gritted teeth. ""Even when you apologize, you still can't help but insult her!"" ""I'm sorry! I'm sorry..."" Daisy whispers. She starts shaking and rubbing her eyes. ""I'm sorry, mommy... I... I didn't mean to be rude... I'm sorry..."" Finally, Phoebe calms down. She glances at me and shrugs. ""My apologies, Nurse Rosalia. My daughter sometimes says the rudest things. Kids, you know? Haha... you can leave the plants alone. I'll take over from here."" I nod along to Phoebe's words. ""...Alright. Do what you want. I have other patients who need my help."" Without another word, I set my half-filled cup of water on a tray beside Miss Belial's bed and head out of the room, leaving behind the nasty humans who dared to insult me. However, as I exit, a strange uneasiness settles upon my skin. _That little girl... something about the way she spoke to me... how did she know I was lying? Do human children possess incredible powers of perception? Was she able to notice the signs of my anger when even her mother couldn't?_ Hm. I'll have to keep an eye on her. Somehow, I don't think she's merely a smart little girl. ... It doesn't take long for me to finish my walk and complete my rounds. With all of my charges cleaned up and inspected, I eventually find myself drifting around the hallways, looking up at clocks on the walls. _11:13 AM. I still have 47 minutes before Doctor Fathy arrives. What am I supposed to do until then? Clean? Ugh. I loved cleaning for Mister Beelzebub, but tidying up after humans isn't any fun!_ Out of sheer boredom, I decide to make my rounds once again. This time, I only peek into the various patient rooms, checking to see if anything has changed in the last thirty minutes. As expected, nothing has. Old Hallister continues snoring soundly, his sleep apnea continuing to give him trouble breathing. I sometimes find myself surprised at how long the remarkably fragile humans can live, even with crippling illnesses ailing them. Why are humans mortal while demons and the vast majority of monsters aren't? Even the orcs, who eventually die of old age, still live to be several thousand years old. Naturally, most orcs die young, in battle. If they weren't constantly killing each other, they might eventually overpower all the other monsters with their sheer numbers! Not even we demons can compare to an orc's reproduction speed! Mister Beelzebub's wise words appear in my mind. He once brought up humans out of the blue, a few thousand years, and his counsel always stuck with me. _Master Agares says humans are not as weak and useless as they appear. Their short lifespans serve to give them focus and drive. Demons failed to crush humanity for tens of thousands of years, all because they never stopped finding new chinks in our armor. Eventually, we defeated them with some outside help, but had we only relied on our strength; we would never have won the ancient wars._ _My master says we must never underestimate the combined strength of humanity. I find the idea that humans could ever overpower demons laughable, but sometimes, Master Agares gets a distant look in his eyes, as if he's seen horrors that will never leave his mind. It's at times like those where I find myself believing everything he says._ _Maybe humans are everything Master Agares claims them to be._ I don't know if Mister Agares was right or wrong. Humans don't seem all that scary to me. Sure, they can build ugly, square houses super fast, and they can make some fancy metal armor, but I don't think they can hold a candle to the power of demonkind. There aren't even three million humans living on Tarus II, Maiura, and the Labyrinth's Core combined. However, there are trillions of demons spread all over the galaxy, and more than half a trillion living within the Labyrinth! How can humans ever hope to stand up to their superiors? That's right. They can't. Jason and Phoebe are just a pair of doe-eyed, star-crossed lovers who don't have a clue what a mess they've gotten themselves into. They think they can beat my people with mere tactics and gadgets, but so long as we have Mister Beelzebub and Bael, not even Belial and a pair of Heroes will be able to hold us off! Hmph! How sad. These filthy humans think they can win a war against demonkind, but they haven't a chance. Their glory days have long since faded into obscurity. I continue a little further down the hall and pause once again in front of Miss Belial's room. However, instead of stepping inside, I pause outside to peek into the doorway. Daisy Hiro sits on the edge of Miss Belial's bed. She leans forward and pokes the Second Emperor's cheek, over and over. ""Wakey, wakey! Wake up! Up 'n at 'em! Wakey!"" Anger builds in my chest. I can barely prevent myself from charging into Miss Belial's hospital room and slapping the insolent little girl to the floor! What right has she to poke and prod a Demon Emperor?! Miss Belial might be the least respected of all demons, but she's still my Emperor! Even more astoundingly, no matter where I look, I don't spot Phoebe. She left her stupid little brat alone with the Emperor! What if the child starts stabbing or cutting Miss Belial, as the evil little monsters tend to do? Human children are agents of chaos! They're worse than imps! Before I can step into the room and give the little brat a piece of my mind, Belial's bathroom door opens, and Phoebe steps out. ""Daisy, that's enough. We need to leave Aunt Sammy for a while. I have a race in an hour I need to attend, alright? Let her get some rest."" Daisy continues to poke the Second Emperor. ""But whyyyyy won't S'matha wake up? She's sleeping too much!"" ""Sammy got hit in the head,"" Phoebe says. She walks over and runs her fingers through Daisy's hair. ""She doesn't feel good. We don't know when she'll wake up."" Daisy frowns. ""Aunt S'matha's head looks fine. Where is she hurt?"" ""Not her skin or her skull, but her brain. Without daddy's crown, we can't heal her. We have to hope she wakes up on her own, or that daddy will be able to find Uncle Solomon's crown again."" Under her breath, Phoebe sighs. ""And I doubt that's going to happen."" Daisy leans forward and presses her hands against Miss Belial's head. ""Aunt S'matha! Waaaake uuuup! WAKE UP! Stop sleeping!"" ""Daisy,"" Phoebe groans. ""Stop that. What have I told you about pestering people? Let your aunt get some- huh?"" Phoebe stops midsentence. Out of curiosity, I lean forward and gaze into the room, trying to pick out what she saw. My heart skips a beat. Miss Belial continue to lay in bed. However, unlike moments earlier, her eyes flutter open. She stares at the ceiling for several moments, before lowering her gaze to Daisy, still hovering inches from her face. ""D... Dais...y?"" The little girl recoils in surprise. ""Ah! S'matha woke up! She woke up!"" Phoebe's jaw drops. ""Sammy?! You're awake! But... but how?!"" A mixture of relief and awe passes over Phoebe, Daisy, and Miss Belial's faces. Confusion follows shortly after. Miss Belial slowly pulls herself into a sitting position. She rubs her head and groans. ""I kept having these awful dreams. Jason was hitting me, telling me he hated me. He wouldn't stop. The next thing I knew, I heard Daisy's voice and opened my eyes. It all happened so fast..."" Phoebe wraps her hand around Miss Belial's. She shoots a wary glance at Daisy before continuing. ""You were in a coma for several weeks. Um, do you remember the Hydra? I can't go into details right now, but after Jason killed the Hydra, someone mind-controlled him and made him attack you. He went completely berserk. We only stopped him with Hope's help."" Miss Belial frowns. ""Hope? I vaguely remember a few fractured images, but none of the details. You'll have to tell me later. I have a splitting headache right now."" Daisy bounces on her butt. ""Aunt S'matha! I'm sooo happy you woke up! Mommy wouldn't stop crying! She always looked super sad; it wasn't dope at all!"" Miss Belial blushes. ""I'm sorry I made you cry, Phoebe."" Phoebe crosses her arms. ""I-I didn't cry. Daisy, stop, um, running your mouth. What have I told you about fibbing?"" The two humans and their Demon Emperor friend all revel in their joyous reunion. However, as I gaze into the room, several suspicions appear in my mind. _How the heck did Miss Belial wake up? Doctor Fathy said several times her brain injuries were extremely severe. It should have taken her several years to recuperate under normal circumstances, even with her enhanced healing factor._ As I gaze upon the humans and their demon friend, a series of footsteps behind me nearly makes me jump out of my skin. I turn around to see none other than Doctor Fathy herself, almost as if I'd summoned her out of thin air! The blue-feathered harpie struts forward with elegance and grace. Her bright yellow beak and dazzling green eyes scrutinize me as she draws near. ""Nurse Rosalia? Chrrrup! What reason have you to skulk outside a patient's room?"" Doctor Fathy's three-toed bird claws _click_ against the tile as she walks, echoing down the corridor behind me. I blush out of embarrassment and turn to face her. ""M-Miss Fathy, I'm sorry. I just... it's a miracle! Miss Belial woke up less than a minute ago! She's talking to Phoebe and everything!"" The harpie blinks a few times before replying. ""She did? How peculiar. Let me see."" Without saying another word, the doctor walks past me and enters the room. I follow after her, making sure to keep a neutral expression. ""Doctor Fathy!"" Phoebe says, her voice rising an octave. ""What timing! Samantha just woke up! Can you perform a checkup on her?"" The harpie nods. She strides past Phoebe to Miss Belial's side, then pulls out a medical gadget from her neatly-pressed uniform. I haven't a clue how it works, but it looks fancy. It must be one of the many inventions the humans made when they settled on Tarus II. _Beep. Beep. Beep._ The doctor holds her gadget near Miss Belial's head while staring at its screen. Several times, she clicks her beak together and cocks her head; expressions I've come to recognize as 'thinking out loud.' ""Hrm. How odd. Very odd indeed. Second Emperor, it seems your innate healing factor has intensified, causing your brain to regenerate at ten times its previous rate. The headaches you are experiencing are a direct result of your neurons stitching themselves together."" Belial stares at the doctor and nods. ""Uh... uh-huh... and that means...?"" ""In the next few hours, your headaches should completely disappear. Once that happens, you'll be free to go! Chrrrup! What a pleasant way to start my day. I hope you'll help me heal the remaining patients once you finish resting and recovering!"" ""Yeah,"" I grumble. ""_You_ get the day off. _I_ still had to clean up all the bedpans..."" Doctor Fathy doesn't hear me and instead continues chirping at Miss Belial. ""You've missed a lot while you were in a coma, Second Emperor. Both Wordsmiths entered the Labyrinth for different reasons. Jason has sent several messages back, and he'll soon arrive at the entrance to Hell Harbor."" ""Hell Harbor? Why would Jason go there?"" Miss Belial asks. She turns to look at Phoebe. ""That world lies at the heart of demonkind's power structure. Going there is suicide!"" Phoebe shakes her head. ""Don't worry, Sam. Jason didn't go alone. He took Kar. They want to meet Ose and negotiate a peace treaty like we discussed before."" ""I told Jason not to do that!"" Belial says, exasperation riddling her voice. ""It's pointless! He'll only piss Ose off!"" ""I know. We went over this, Sam. Don't you remember?"" ""I... I don't. Or, maybe I do. My memories are still a jumble..."" Phoebe glances at Doctor Fathy. ""Is she going to suffer memory problems into the future?"" ""That depends on how much further Belial's regeneration manages to heal her brain. If she makes a full recovery, her memories should return. Even if they don't, Jason's Wordsmithing might be able to recover the rest. It seems like only her short-term memories were affected, but we'll have to wait and see."" ""Thank you, doctor,"" Phoebe says, grinning from ear to ear. ""This is such great news! Jason will be so relieved when he returns."" ""As are we all,"" Doctor Fathy says. She turns to leave and beckons to me. ""Nurse Rosalia, I've more errands for you to complete before your shift ends. Come along."" I gaze at Daisy for a moment before nodding at the doctor. ""Alright."" The two of us step out of the room. Before the doctor can say anything, I raise my hand. ""Um, Doctor Fathy, I had a question for you. It's, um... it's about... _parasites_. Do you know anything about them?"" ""Chrrrp! You've asked the right harpie!"" Doctor Fathy says, lilting her voice cutely. I've learned that when she does that, it means she's in a good mood. Considering her best healer has emerged from a coma, it's no wonder she's in high spirits. ""What sort of parasite? Ringworm? Intestinal frogs? Perhaps even a Big Black Blotch Barnacle? I know about most of them!"" I hesitate for a moment. ""Err, well, I don't know what it's called..."" ""Now, now, you have to tell me something specific. I can't just stand here and throw darts in the darkness! Who's the patient?"" I swallow heavily. ""Um, a friend of mine. She's been hearing a voice in her head. It talks to her about her darkest desires."" Doctor Fathy's feathers ruffle at my words. ""Hallucinations. Chrrrp... hmm... odd, very odd indeed. Might it perhaps be a brain parasite? If you take me to the patient, I can diagnose them at once! Brain parasites are no joke!"" I rub my hands together. ""No, no, my friend is very _shy_. She's an herbal remedy sort of person, one who irrationally hates doctors. You know how they are. I just wanted to offer her some general advice."" The doctor cocks her head back and forth. Her eyes flick from me to the ceiling and floor. ""Chrrrp! Hmm, herbal remedy... oh, dear. If she has a brain parasite, then she could be in grave danger! However, I cannot heal someone who doesn't want me near them. I'll tell you what! If she injects one shot of neuropozyne into her neck each day for two weeks, it should starve the parasite of its nutrients. Tell her it's a homemade honey extract. She won't know the difference! Even if I'm wrong, the neuropozyne won't cause any harmful side effects."" I nod. ""Alright. What if that doesn't work?"" The doctor chirps squeakily. ""Hee-hoo! Then she'd better get in here, or she might die! I'm a doctor, not a magician!"" The doctor flaps her wings at me — a farewell, in harpie culture — and walks away, leaving me with my thoughts. Moments later, Desire bubbles up within my mind. **Oh, dear. It seems you've found something that can kill me. Whatever shall I do? Haha. No doctor can save you from my power, little Rosie. Do what you must, but you'll never rid yourself of me. Besides! In time, you'll come to appreciate my presence.** I scowl at my inner voice. _No, I won't! Stop trying to act like you're my friend. You're just a creepy leech stuck in my gut._ Desire falls silent for a moment. **Haha. Is that what you think?** Another short pause. **I'm so much more than a parasite, Rosie, dear. My kind has existed for tens of thousands of years. I grant demons a special ability, one that little knockoff, Mephisto, eventually stole. Would you like to know what it is?** My heartbeat quickens. _...No. I don't... don't need to know._ **Oh, come now. You're curious. Go ahead; ask me.** _Fine. What ability do you grant? It's not like it matters._ Desire's voice deepens. **Hohoho... I sense your interest is deepening. Very well, I'll tell you. My presence within your body unlocks a special ability...** **The ability... to steal... _souls._** _Souls? What?! You made me into a soul-manipulator, like Mister Beelzebub?!_ **Haha. Oh, yes, I did. Of course, until you use my power, you aren't _technically_ a soul-manipulator. But you _will_ use it. All my vessels do, eventually. Once you make your first kill, you'll feel your victim's essence flow inside of you. You'll instantly become addicted to the thrill of the hunt!** **Nobody can resist the allure of obtaining power. Since time immemorial, demons have sought the strength to stand above others. Think of it, Rosalia. All you must do is eliminate a few meddlesome fleshbags. One here, two there... and soon enough, you'll evolve into a higher form.** I lean against the corridor wall, while rubbing my face. _I don't want to reach some higher form. I only want to stand by Mister Beelzebub's side. Moreover, demons can already take human souls. You're not giving me a new ability, after all, you liar!_ **Tsk. That is where you're wrong, Rosalia. When demons kill humans, the River Styx absorbs their souls. What I do is allow you to absorb your victim's soul directly, bypassing the river. Besides... haven't you ever wondered how that thief, Mephisto, created the river?** _No. Who cares? You're babbling nonsense!_ Desire's voice turns irritable. **I'm not. Open your brain, you empty-headed dullard! The River Styx is hardly a natural phenomenon. Through it, Satan was able to create the Labyrinth and dominate the other Hells. It was only thanks to that damned thief Satan managed to create such an intricate structure! It's all because of Mephisto's meddling-** I interrupt Desire. _Hold on, Satan created the Labyrinth? Mister Beelzebub never told me that._ **Of course he didn't. Beelzebub doesn't know. Few do. It's a well-kept secret among the upper ranks. If the Hidden Emperors learned of the river's importance, they would band together and seize it for themselves.** _Hidden Emperors...?_ Desire sighs. **You still have much to learn, Rosalia. Never mind. Go about your business. I've wasted too much energy talking to you. I need to rest for a while. Perhaps later, I'll regale you with tales that will dazzle you endlessly. For now, you'll just have to make do with your imagination.** _Wait, but I still have questions-_ **I care not, whelp. Consume a few souls, and _maybe_ I'll give you the answers you seek.** _But..._ Before I can offer a protest, Desire's presence fades away, vanishing into the depths of my mind. I awaken from a dreamlike trance to find myself staring at the floor. Several minutes pass. Eventually, I pull myself out of my stupor and shuffle toward the nurse's station. _Forget it. I'm done working for the day. I need a nap._ As I leave, my thoughts turn inward. _Who are the Hidden Emperors? What significance does the River Styx hold?_ _Most importantly... how could Desire know all of these secrets? Who even is she?_ ....................................... **FOR RETURNING READERS FROM CLASSIC: Please use spoiler tags when commenting on anything that might ruin the story for new readers, especially if that information is based on your knowledge of Classic!** >!This is what a spoiler looks like!

747,"[NSFW] A little concoction of all the wrong thingsTo start off, I’m only 19, but I wanted to still share what I have. It’s also my first time posting on this sub, so please be patient with me as I may make a few mistakes. “Edit:” as I’m writing this, I’m realizing that it is much longer than I could’ve expected. There’s is a lot of heavy topics covered such as depression, suicide, and the like. Please don’t read this if this may upset you. Thanks. To start off, I grew up in the top 20% or so, of Americans, in a nearly crime free town in Indiana, which seems like a blessing, but, indeed, it was sometimes a curse. Throughout my childhood (1-6y/o) my parents treated me like any other spoiled kid you’d expect to come from the top 20%. I don’t remember much of that time, but looking back at pictures and the occasional video shows what one would expect. Just before my 7th birthday, my dads mom (BR as I will refer to her) had a heart attack and would later pass away from the resulting injuries. My family moved down to help her as my parents were the only ones, in both of their families, who were financially stable enough to afford a move. Just before my primary school years, I moved down to Louisiana to stay at BRs house until she got better or passed. My parents were constantly stressed during the first half of my first grade year, and it passed onto my sister and I. Just before Christmas 2007, my grandma passed away, and my dad took a huge toll because of it. She had been the one who kept him, even after his father left her because she wouldn’t have my dad aborted, and raised him singlehandedly. My dad did not have any easy childhood. When he was 14/15 he had 2 jobs on top of school, and eventually paid for his own college. BR was there the entire time, supporting him emotionally, despite her inability to help financially. After BRs death, my family moved back to Indiana where I continued school at a private Christian school. From the second half of my first grade year until the beginning of my fifth grade year was relatively uneventful. However, starting my fifth grade year and continuing until my freshman year, I was severely bullied. I was shoved into lockers, threatened, called horrendous names, and the like. I never told anyone as my mom had started to drift more towards caring for my sister and my dad worked throughout most of the day, and on a not-so-rare occasion would even sleep at his office, that he owns. At about the beginning of my seventh grade year, my mom had all but abandoned me as my sister started to become internet famous (now at around 5-600k subs on YouTube). My mom dedicated every free moment to my sister and started to ignore me. With my dad at work and my mom and sister ignoring me, I felt alone at home. At school, my friend group started expanding and with each expansion, I was left out more and more, on top of the almost daily bullying. During my either grade year, three of closer friends commit suicide. None of them left any form of reasoning. The first two cut themselves and the last hung himself. When the first two went, me and the last friend started to drift, neither of us really coping with what had happened. I did what my dad had taught me and put on a face that seemed cheerful to the outside, and wept on my pillow when I got home. After my last friend passed, I thought I’d been done with this life and tried to cut myself as well. I failed, but was left with scars that constantly remind me of one of my lowest points. I was numb. Devoid of all emotion, except to the outside world, which only saw a “normal,” quirky child. I still haven’t truly coped with their deaths, and every time it’s brought up, I get numb, stiff, and I can’t feel anything. Needless to say my eighth grade year was not a good one. This isn’t to say this time was devoid of happiness, though. I was on a robotics team that made second in the world, and I was progressing quickly through Boy Scouts, my one true escape from the hardships I was going through. During this time, my parents became increasingly aggressive towards each other. No real fighting, but argument after argument, threat after threat, and much manipulation from, mostly, my moms side. Both of my parents showed their true colors. My dad being the very business person, taking no shit from anyone, and being extremely strict and “the hammer” of the house. While my mom was the gentle caretaker who coddled my sister and made me believe that I was just as important to her, putting me against my dad. At the beginning of my freshman year of HS, my parents finally sat us down and said they were getting divorced. My sister and I weren’t shocked. We had both seen it coming. What neither of us had seen, however, was the next four years of psychological warfare that would follow. Both parents fought tooth and nail for my sister and I. The twist was that only my dad truly wanted my sister and I. My mom wanted my sister and I for the money. My sister was this “upcoming YouTube sensation” and I was a monthly alimony check. My dad wanted to raise us to be successful business-people who could do what they want, when they want. My freshman year was spent dealing internally with bullies and losing touch with most of my friends. I failed out of classes, lost what little respect I’d had, and had no one to go to. I barely made it through my freshman year and my parents were almost entirely clueless. It wasn’t until a Guardian Ad litem that anyone truly noticed that something was seriously wrong. She recommended that I go to therapy, and that my dad be my full custody parent. The following year, my sophomore year, I transferred to a public school, my mom moved out into an apartment, and my social life deteriorated. I had lost touch with nearly all of my friends, except for one who I rarely talk to anymore anyways, and was extremely introverted as I was even more worried about being bullied. I spent most of my first semester minding my own business, got a job and kept to myself, until a girl approached me in my chemistry class. This girl would become one of my best friends and one of the few people who I can say, throughout my life, I truly trust. If it hadn’t been for her, I would have spent my high school years alone, in my own bubble. She lead me to others who I then became friends with. However, these friends seemed different. At first I couldn’t tell what, but I eventually realized that these new friends I had made were all fake. None of them treated me as one of them which only further reinforced my thought that I was alone in the world. My junior year, I spent attempting to expand my friend group. Through a line of communication, I ended up in an AP European History class where I would meet my first girlfriend. Once again I had slipped into my usual “mind my own business” routine, but she crept into my life. She sat in front of me and would do the casual silly stuff like, mess with my pens, water bottle, etc. eventually I decided that I’d ask her to go to our schools homecoming dance with me. She said yes, and after those next few weeks, I feel confident to say that I was entirely in love. I would’ve done anything for her. However with her, I made many mistakes. I had no sense of what was socially acceptable, and I overstepped even legal lines. Our relationship soon deteriorated into this overly sexual coexistence where, looking back, it seemed like we just used each other to satisfy our sexual desires. Even though we were mostly satisfying those urges with each other, I still felt like I could talk to her and everything else you would expect out of a healthy relationship. During that time my stepmom came into my life. At first it was weird, but I quickly acclimated to her being in my dad and my house. It was her who ended up coaching me and, much to my dismay, finding out about my relationship with my girlfriend. Her and my dad immediately tried to separate us. I pushed and pushed, saying we’d change, and for a time we did. It wouldn’t last, though. We slipped back into old habits, and my parents were on the verge of taking legal action to separate us when me and my gf finally split. To say it wasn’t easy on either of us was an understatement. I became suicidal for the second time in my short life, and started cutting again, leaving more scars that would never heal. My parents had me on lockdown within my own home. I spent nights outside of their bedroom on hardwood floors, sleeping under the watchful gaze of a camera, and had most of my belongings taken as they could’ve been used to harm myself. Once again, this further pushed my mental vision that I wasn’t actually a part of my own home. My life consisted of waking up, going to school, going to work, then coming home to eat and sleep. I didn’t go out, I didn’t talk to friends, I didn’t enjoy life like most kids did/would. My senior year of high school was a year of clarity in the storm, and looking back now, it has the feeling of standing in the middle of a cat 5 hurricane. During that year, I became an Eagle Scout, was overall successful in my job being offered a management position despite having just turned 18, and stabilizing my mental health. During the late fall/early spring of that year, I was diagnosed with Primary ADHD, and Secondary Depression and Anxiety (in other words, my depression and anxiety stemmed from my ADHD). I was put on medicine, and I had a successful year. I found a job to work over the summer that paid handsomely, for coming straight out of HS, I got a 29 on the ACT, graduated with a 3.3GPA, and was accepted to my top pick college. The only hiccup during my senior year was one night, before I started my meds, that I nearly drank myself to death. I had been depressed and my parents had just left town when I decided that I’d go drink nearly 30 shots worth of rum. I was by myself, and when I woke up in the morning, I found videos of myself drunkenly crying, I had recorded goodbyes to my friends and had called 911 for myself. I woke up in the ICU, IV in my arm and a nurse standing over me. My shirt was an entirely different shade than it had been from when I could last remember due to me nearly throwing up my stomach itself. The overall cost of my escapade was nearly $7,000. A bill that I am still slowly paying off to this day. My freshman year of college (this fall) I came to school, and was rushed the same fraternity my dad went to, on the same campus. The semester started off great. A breath of fresh air, out on my own from my parents, and going to parties. As the semester progressed, I stopped taking my medicine. My grades deteriorated and I was none the wiser. I focused on the weekly partying, college life, and work. By the end of the semester, my GPA dropped to a 1.3, I was becoming increasingly stressed, and I was on the verge of not being able to pay for my bills. Over the break, I am staying with my dad and stepmom who are, fairly, upset. My dad wants me to find a second job for weeknights and weekends, but is stuck in the 1960s when you could, and this is a quote of his “walk in and start work on the spot.” He doesn’t understand why it has taken me 2 weeks to even get a response back, and is getting increasingly frustrated with this, and has barely had anything to me except that he is disappointed in me and that I should “just get my head out of the gutter and get moving.” I recently told my parents, while somewhat drunk, but still with truthful intent, that I was going to kill myself, and my stepmom told me that she thought I was saying that only to hurt her, and my dad shrugged it off like it was nothing. All of this culminated this morning when my dad told me that he’d rather me kill myself than sit around and waste my life being depressed, anxious, and a disappointment. I’ve been numb all day and have had one of the, if not the, worst migraines I’ve ever had. Looking back, I don’t think I’ve ever truly heard my dad say that he’s proud of me. Or at least when he did it felt forced and unrealistic. I know deep down he loves me, but I can’t help but feel the opposite. Each night I come home, he doesn’t ask how my day was or give me a hug, instead he asks where I’ve applied that day, what I’m doing to get another job, and to tell me that I’m being lazy, careless, and ignorant. To some degree, I’m inclined to believe he’s right. I’ve lost all but a sliver of the motivation I had, and have no drive to apply myself to anything. I know my bills are only gonna get bigger, and I’m not doing much on the front of getting a new job. That being said... To those who read this far, I sincerely appreciate you. I’ve poured my heart into this and hope that everyone feels loved, appreciated, and believed in. Maybe if I had, had that experience I wouldn’t be in the position I’m in today, but we’ll never know.",
748,"My family is destroying my mental healthTrigger warning for child abuse and suicide mentions. I've never really had anywhere to go about any of this, so I'm just going to rant about everything that's been bothering me. It's long. My mom's made it fairly clear that I was the worst mistake of her life. She had me when she was 16 after forgetting her birth control, and finished school early and became a nurse as that was her only option at the time. She's told me this multiple times, with this tone of absolute disgust and anger in her voice. She'd rant to me nonstop about how my grandma, great grandma, uncles, etc would spoil me when they took care of me for her to be in school. I still can't understand what she meant by that other than that they had a hard time telling me no when I wanted something. My biological father wasn't in the picture by the time I was around 4, and my mom met my dad. The three of us moved a couple of states away so my mom could work. They were convinced I was a horribly spoiled child and needed to be ""broken"" of my habits, so every little thing I did was punished. This seemed to get worse when my brother was born. ""You said something that didn't agree with me? You gave me a look I didn't like? You didn't respond to an order the way I wanted? The way you breathed just now sounded heavy? You're crying and expressing basic human emotions? Get beaten with a belt. Stand in the corner for the rest of the day. Then you're grounded for two weeks."" I didn't get grounded like other kids my age did. They lost TV, video games, toys, etc, I got grounded from *everything*. They'd make a 7 year old kid sit at the kitchen table, doing absolutely nothing for days on end for something minuscule. I even got hit once just because I wasn't understanding my dad trying to help with my homework. Their toddler? No, he could get away with murder. If I wasn't grounded I was stuck in our room keeping him entertained while dad worked and mom sat downstairs playing computer games all day. Once Dad got sick of my brother crying about how I didn't want to play with him so he yanked the book I was reading out of my hands and threw it. He rarely got punished for doing things I wouldn't even dare think of doing. He'd hit me, scream at me, break my things, trash the room when he was having a fit, and nothing was done about it. I wasn't allowed to defend myself if he hit me or bit me, if I told them he broke one of my toys it'd just get thrown out, if he trashed the room I'd just have to clean it up. I snapped and hit him back *once,* we were about 8 and 3 at the time. Unfortunately Dad was walking down the hall and watched it happen, I was dragged down the stairs, beaten multiple times, told to stand in the corner, I'd be there for several days, and then I was grounded for a month. On one of those days I ended up fainting. They let me sit at the table for a couple of hours but then it was right back to it, despite me panicking and crying about falling again. Mom's always been lazy. She stopped working for a while and Dad was out of the house most of the day, but she did almost nothing to care for us. She'd walk to take the laundry to the laundromat, but that was it. She'd bring it home and I'd fold all of it, including hers, while she'd sit there and watch me and complain how I wasn't doing them neatly enough. Dad usually cooked, but he wasn't home for it anymore. Mom taught me how to make ramen, then left me to my own devices. I'd get my brother and I cereal in the morning, PB&J for lunch, sometimes Mom would make me get one for her too, and more sandwiches or ramen for dinner. If I was lucky and Dad was home one night to cook, we'd have that and Mom would microwave the leftovers the next night. Unsurprisingly I've always been very weak, I couldn't keep up with most of my classmates playing at school because I'd just run out of energy so easily. I didn't really have friends to play with anyway, I didn't get to leave the house much besides school so I never learned how to socialize. I actually got invited to a couple of birthday parties, but wasn't allowed to go because Mom didn't want me getting influenced by other families. I was lonely, but I got to call my great grandma every Sunday, unless I was grounded. I'd vent to her about everything that's happened to me since the last time we'd call. When I was 10 we moved back to our hometown, and it was like a dream come true. I was confused as to why Dad wasn't coming with us for a while, but didn't really care. I'd get to stay with family that's nice to me! I was also allowed on my great grandma's computer, and she gave it to me when she upgraded. I had friends from my new school now, but my online friends were better. I didn't care that Mom hated the idea of me talking to strangers over the internet, I'd just have to hide it from her. I knew what I was doing. Dad moved a couple of months behind us and then broke the news to me and my brother that they were getting divorced. I was never told why. I got over it pretty quickly, that's one less person to be mean to me, and he visited every Wednesday and took us to McDonald's so it wasn't like he was gone. No more than a couple months after the divorce Mom would disappear most weekends. She then introduced us to her new boyfriend. A few more months later, she announces she's pregnant. Because my great grandma was living in an elderly community, they eventually had to ask us to leave because young families weren't meant to stay there. My mom and brother went to live with her boyfriend and his parents until they could get a house, but my great grandma convinced everyone to let me stay. I was really quiet and wouldn't be bothering anyone else in the neighborhood, and there wasn't much room at the other house anyways. Mom would make me stay over with her sometimes, but it was absolute heaven staying with just me and my great grandma. I moved across town once my mom and step dad got a house. All my friends from my old school immediately dropped me, and I wasn't able to talk to my online friends as much. My SD did a fair share of the housework, so it wasn't as awful at the time. Though my mom and SD would often have me take care of my baby sister just because they didn't want to deal with her. Most of my online friends dropped each other from drama or just stopped playing our game. I tried so hard to fix everything and to get everyone to make up, but it didn't work out. Then I, as a miserable little 13 year old, got lost in thought. I wasn't happy. My friends were gone, and I was alone. My family was still toxic. I decided I just wanted *out*. I snuck out of the house one night so no one would find me, and walked to an empty field a couple miles away with a knife to try and end it. I got too scared to do anything and realized something was wrong with me, so I walked to the hospital and admitted myself instead. They called Mom, who came in heartbrokenly sobbing and holding me and asking if it was her fault. I didn't have the heart to tell her anything. She was rarely out of earshot when I talked to doctors either, so I couldn't tell them. Because my mom was a nurse they prescribed me antidepressants and iron supplements for anemia (that's what happens when you live off of cereal, sandwiches, and noodles. After the first prescription, they never got refilled anyway), then discharged me since my mom was a nurse and I wasn't allowed out of her sight for three days. My dad was also in that room with us, but just seemed apathetic the whole time. I don't know if he shut down emotionally or actually just didn't care. Everyone was super gentle around me for a couple of months, then it just fell back to normal. About a year later I, the perfect straight-A student, started struggling in school. No one seemed to care or understand that I just didn't have the motivation for it anymore, and it was just met with aggression. Ended up getting grounded from everything for the first time in years (my brother had lied about doing any of his work and did nothing but video games for a month, only got grounded from video games once he was caught), but thankfully this time I was allowed to stay in my room. I started feeling suicidal again, and laid in bed all night several nights in a row trying to get myself to just do it. Then my great grandma came to get me to take me to school, and I broke and cried to her and tried to tell her about what happened. Then the woman I trusted with *everything* until that point, looked at the marks on my arm, scoffed, and told me to get ready for school. I was crushed. Then she softened again and let me stay home, and told Mom about what happened. When she got home, she held me, crying again, tried talking to me, said she struggled with the same thing when I was her age, that maybe it'd be a good idea getting me a therapist (which I agreed to, but never happened). Again, everything fell back in it's toxic cycle soon after, as if it had never happened. My SD was also getting more aggressive. I had years of experience of walking on eggshells, so I never set him off. My brother and sister on the other hand, angered him a lot. He never hit my brother, but my sister would get spanked or slapped on the hand often. He'd also scream and swear at them both a lot, he knew how to get loud. My brother started acting out just to spite him, they'd always be arguing about something. Dad's weekly visits changed to my brother just venting and trash talking his stepdad the entire time while I just hid in my room unable to handle the negativity. Dad kept going to Mom to get her to do something, but it rarely happened. Dad finally got Mom to let him lecture SD, and he sat down with him outside and talked to him for two hours. He laughed afterwards about how they had started a couple of feet apart, but SD had moved to the other side of the room by the end of it. I just silently listened to him, hurt. It's okay for me to go through what I did but SD screaming at him when he's intentionally getting on his nerves is unacceptable? Dad's even vented to me a couple of times, all recently, how he can't find a relationship like the one he had with Mom, how he's so stressed with work, how he can't handle everything going on in our house, asking *me, the 15 year old* for advice. I wouldn't mind if he'd let me ask the same of him. I've given up trying to vent to him, telling me I'm making no sense or that you had it worse does not help me. It isn't fair how much weight they're putting on me. SD came panicked to me about how we just got an eviction notice because they hadn't been paying bills on time. I had a panic attack and texted Dad. I just wanted him to take us to live with him and leave both SD and Mom to rot in their poor decisions. Dad agreed we shouldn't be there, but then turned around and emptied all his savings to Mom so she could pay everything off. About 6 weeks ago SD turned on Mom and had a big argument with her. She finally snapped and decided she was kicking him out. Vented to me about everything as she packed his things, told me to take both of my siblings to a room away from them so they wouldn't have to witness anything when SD got home from work that day. She had Dad come over and basically act as a bodyguard so she could throw him out. He had it coming to him, honestly, but I don't think I'll ever forget the pain coming from him on his last night here. I went to do the dishes and he was sitting on the couch, looking absolutely devastated and heartbroken, holding one of my sister's toys. Since SD is now gone, I've been held responsible for both my siblings. Mom wants someone watching my sister at all times, since she gets into things she shouldn't when unsupervised, but she's always hiding back in her room and refuses to watch her own daughter herself. It's been me making dinner most nights, and there hasn't been much to use lately. She orders herself tshirts and crap off Amazon but rarely goes grocery shopping. My brother and I split doing everyone's laundry. I can't have him help keep the 4 year old under control. His anger issues are out of hand, and if he's left alone with her for too long they'll start fighting and he'll start screaming at her that he hates her. I've tried to talk to him about it before but nothing has worked. I don't know what to do about any of this. I know I'm depressed, and that I need help, but I don't have the means to get it. They'd have to get Mom's consent and someone willing to take me for any mental health services. I can't see anything worthwhile in life seeing how well it's gone for my family. Every day I'm on the verge of just screaming, punching my mom at the next order she barks at me, lying on the floor in front of everyone to cry, or all three. I've tried to talk to teachers at school before, but it's physically very hard to. I start feeling sick at the idea of trying to vent all my problems verbally. Even here, I've been stuck for a couple of hours now trying to organize my thoughts into something legible. I have no clue what to do anymore.",
749,"[DISCUSSION] Lisa Stasi and her 4-month old daughter Tiffany were abducted by a serial killer (John Edward Robinson) - he kills mom and SELLS daughter. She finds out she's a missing person at 15 years old. Her mother's remains have never been found. I've included an interview I did with her.[Video of all of my research](https://youtu.be/n9Py2QBOxFk), including my interview with Heather Tiffany Robinson. I hope you enjoy it. It covers everything written below, if you prefer a viewing experience, rather than a written summary. As a disclaimer, I started a channel on YouTube called NightDocs a few weeks ago delving into different mysteries and internet oddities. After my work on the Room 322 case which I posted last month, I really caught the bug for content creation and I was eager to sink my teeth into a new case to look into. The story of this case was so engaging, so emotionally impactful for me, and I personally feel it is criminally under-told. Without further ado... # Introduction What if you found out that your life was all a lie? What if you uncovered something about your past that was that was so horrible, so terrifying and surreal that it completely changed everything that you thought you knew about yourself? Today we’re going to look at the answers to those very questions, with a very real person was kidnapped by a serial killer as a small baby. # Background The year was 1984, and 19-year-old Lisa Stassi was down on hard times. She had separated from her husband Carl, took the clothes on her back and her weeks-old baby girl Tiffany, left her home town of Huntsville Alabama, and traveled to Kansas City where she stayed at a battered women’s shelter. She had no money, no job, no opportunities, and a tiny baby girl named Tiffany to care for. At the worst possible time in her life where hope was so hard to find, she met a man who called himself John Osborne. John told Lisa that he had an opportunity for her. He ran a charity designed to help new mothers. He wanted to send her to a job training program in Texas. Not only was there no strings attached, he would pay for her travel, accommodations, and even day care for her infant daughter Tiffany while she studied to obtain her GED. When she told her sister-in-law about this amazing opportunity, alarm bells began ringing in her sister-in-law’s mind. As they say, if something seems too good to be true, it probably isn’t. On January 10th, Osborne picked up Lisa at her sister-in-law’s house to bring her to a hotel. She went in Osborne’s car with her daughter and left behind all her belongings and her yellow Toyota Corolla. She was never seen again. The last contact anyone had with her was later that day, when she called her mother-in-law in hysterics. She had been told by some unnamed men that she was going to lose custody of her daughter because her mother-in-law had reported Lisa to be an unfit parent. She told Lisa that she had done no such thing. Eventually, the conversation eased and Lisa calmed down, but mentioned that these men had asked her to sign 4 blank sheets of paper with her signature and had not given her a reason yet. Lisa’s mother-in-law advised her not to sign these papers, but the call was cut short when she abruptly said “here they come” and hung up the line. That was the last time anyone spoke to Lisa ever again. Years go by. Searches and missing persons reports for both Lisa and her daughter Tiffany. As the years went on, hope faded of ever finding either of them alive. As the years went by, police released age progression images of what they thought Tiffany might look like as a teenager. # A Killer is Caught So, as it turns out, John Osborne was not a philanthropist running a charity to aid new mothers found in battered women’s shelters. His real name is John Edward Robinson, a con man, sexual deviant, and serial killer. Police had long suspected him of terrible crimes, but it wasn’t until they searched his property, finding the bodies of two victims in chemical barrels and several more in a storage locker, that the pieces fell into place concerning a young girl who now went by the name of Heather Robinson. In 1985, John Robinson’s brother Don and his wife were trying to have a family with little success. They confided in John that they were looking at adopting. John told them that he knew of a little girl that needed to be adopted urgently because the mother had committed suicide. For a small fee of $7,000, John could facilitate the adoption of the child in a hurry. Once again, if something is too good to be true… They flew from Chicago to meet their new adopted baby girl in Kansas City, where John provided forged documents with signatures of a judge and two lawyers and the adoption was made quote unquote official. He then accepted a cashiers check for further “legal fees” and the couple returned to Chicago with the girl they decided to name Heather Tiffany Robinson. Tiffany, because they had been told that it was the girls original name. Tiffany, now named Heather, grew up in a loving home. Although she battled through rough middle and high school years, she had a good environment, having no clue what dark past she would soon uncover about herself. It never occurred to her parents how strange the origin of their daughter was until the year 2000 when John was arrested. The whole family was together on the phone with the police when it was revealed to them that they believed Heather was Tiffany Stasi, a child everyone had long thought was gone. To the Stasi family, it was a wave of emotions full of joy and relief in finding long lost Tiffany. When that same wave made its way to the shores of the Robinson family, there was shock, anguish, confusion, betrayal… fear. The adoption had been forged. They only knew that now. But what would happen? Would they lose their daughter? Would Tiffany… now Heather…. lose the only family she’s ever known and loved? Although Don and Helen Robinson had done nothing **intentionally** illegal, they now faced increased legal scrutiny. Not only for their association with John, but the nature of the adoption of their daughter Heather. The struggle Heather had throughout this ordeal was immense. Years of learning to cope with her past, mental health issues that came up, and a media frenzy that wanted nothing more than to get a peek into the mind of someone with such a traumatic event in their life. She’s spent years trying to reconnect with her mother’s family, trying to get to know who Lisa was as a person, trying to imagine what a life with her would have been like had Lisa survived the encounter with John Robinson. I’m personally fortunate enough to know a little about Heather’s struggle, not because I’ve had to go through them myself, but because I found her. Today, Heather runs an organization called the Lisa Stasi Effect. An organization dedicated to bringing awareness to her mother’s story and to help Heather gain some closure on finding her mother’s missing remains against all odds. I reached out to her a few days ago through Facebook, and asked if I could take a moment to interview her about her experiences. Although she was hesitant to appear on camera or audio, **she did agree to give me some written responses** to some questions that I had for her. &#x200B; # THE INTERVIEW Proof of Exclusive Interview **First I want to thank you so much for being willing to speak with me and answer a few questions. Your story is fascinating, and I’m really grateful to get your perspective on this so many years after the fact.** >Thank you for your interest in my mother's case and taking the time to speak about her. **From my research, and correct me if I’m wrong, it seemed like you were about 15 when you discovered the true story of your birth and past. What was that like for someone getting into high school? What was the reaction from your classmates?** >High school was very hard for me leading up to John. I was exhibiting the beginning signs of bipolar. I was on medication after medication on top of hospitalizations from inability to cope to adverse side effects from medication. It was the summer of 2000 when John was arrested. For my final 3 years of high school I was home schooled through the district. I didn't actually began having social interaction with people other than neighbors or online until I was about 25. **Your adoptive parents must have had an unbelievable shock when they found out who your adopted uncle was. What was the conversation with them like, and how did they try to ease the blow by telling you where you really came from?** >We all found out together. I listened in to a phone call informing my dad of John's arrest. I remember fear, confusion and shock. The pain of seeing my mother in almost hysterics and my father defeated in tears, scared he'd lose his daughter. With everything being detailed in news coverage there was no shelter from any of this. I just lived it day by day. **Since the adoption papers were forged by your adoptive uncle, what kind of legal scrutiny did your parents face concerning your adoption?** >My adoptive parents went through a lengthy investigation. It was through that investigation and turning in those adoption papers that showed the levels of John's ability to con and forge. John had created an elaborate private adoption using real lawyers, judge and notary. This scam went on for over a year, including collecting information such as social security numbers and other information needed not only for the adoption but background check. The original adoption date was for Dec 1984 but fell through until Jan 1985 when they received a call that they were able to find a child but needs to be immediately picked up or will become a ward of the state. All this information was used to tie John's connection to myself and Lisa. **You mentioned to me over chat that when you finally did the interview with 20/20 that you wanted to correct the record on the contact that you’ve had with your biological extended family. What kind of contact were you able to have with them through the years, and do you still keep in contact?** >I immediately met with Lisa's mother, step father and Aunt. They came to Illinois and my family went to Alabama to visit with them. We kept communication for years through phone and letter. I was very close with Lisa's mother, my granny until her passing in 2018. > >I don't know why but ever since finding out I was adopted at an early age I never had any interest in knowing or finding my biological father. > >When news broke about Lisa that's when I first found out my mother was homeless, living in shelters and her car, separated from her husband who was accused of domestic violence. > >As an angry, traumatized teenage girl I couldn't comprehend a man who was my ""father"" being capable of inflicting physical pain against a woman, especially my murdered mother. > >I was scared of \[the\] control Carl had over my life. He could go on tv and say my parents were keeping me from him and he demanded to know me but even when we spoke on the phone, \[he\] couldn't address those issues. > >As I began to talk to more biological family both Lisa and Carl's I found out not only did he have nothing to do with filing a police report he had remarried years later never telling his new family about Lisa and his missing daughter. > >When I was 18 and safe from being taken from my home I cut communication. Our conversations were becoming inappropriate and learning that same pattern of domestic abuse carried into his future relationships after Lisa made me want nothing to do with him or to pursue a relationship. > >As of 2015 his immediate family has lost contact with him. > >As of 2018 his other child has lost contact with him. **Do you have any final thoughts that you'd like to share about your experience in general?** >At this time I'm processing everything. I found out a lot about my mother but unfortunately it wasn't all good information. Her childhood leading up to John was full of trauma, neglect, possible abuse and sexual assault. > >I've personally found it hard to cope with the fact \[that\] my mother was allegedly abused by her own husband before they permanently separated. I've learned of stories from police archives of potential threats to my life since I was born by the people meant to protect me. > >It's disheartening to find peace for yourself when your own mother and others close to you suffer daily or lost everything. > >I hope talking about it brings awareness and saves others. I want to make my mother's name known and create amazing things in her honor. > >I find myself wanting to create a world where we talk more about Paula, Lisa, Catherine, Beverly, Sheila, Debbie, Isabella and Suzette over John. **Your mother and John’s other victims, yes.** >I want the people who associated, assisted and possibly helped John be exposed for their heinous acts. > >I'm trying to learn how to forgive circumstances that have people who don't want forgiveness and don't believe they did anything wrong. > >I want to shine light on how ridiculous and complicated this whole process is from media to the criminal system. **Thank you Heather, it’s been an honor speaking with you.** &#x200B; # Conclusion In the wake of so much destruction and pain left by one depraved individual, Heather Tiffany Robinson is proof that no matter how bleak the odds are for finding a missing person, there is always room for hope. And when there is hope, there can be life.

Victims of John Robinson * Paula Godfrey, 19 * Lisa Stasi, 19 * Catherine Clampitt, 27 * Sheila Dale Faith, 45 * Sheila's daughter Debbie Lynn Faith, 15 * Izabela Lewicka, 21 * Beverly Bonner, 49 * Suzette Trouten, 28 # Summary A few days ago, I had the honor of interviewing **Heather Tiffany Robinson**, born Tiffany Stasi. When she was an infant, she and her mother Lisa Stasi were abducted by serial killer John Edward Robinson. Since many of his murders post-1993 were facilitated using online BDSM chat rooms, he is sometimes referred to as ""The Internet's First Serial Killer"". I've spent the last 2 weeks researching this story, sifting through police reports, news articles, court documents, and books to get to the meat of the story I wanted to tell with this new video and post. Although most commentary seems to be around the killer John Robinson himself, the story that fascinated me the most was the story of how a 15-year-old girl came to the explosive realization that what she thought she knew about herself all her life was a lie and how she had to learn how to come to grips with the horrible reality that she was a missing person who had been abducted by a serial killer when she was 4 months old and sold to her mother's killer's brother for $7,000. I worked incredibly hard on this story, culminating in an exclusive interview with that very same woman who was kind enough to grant me an interview and give me her thoughts on coping with such a horrific tragedy, her efforts to re-connect with her biological family who thought she was dead, and her journey to learn as much as she can about her murdered mother and seek her remains to give her a proper dignified final burial someday. She now runs an organization called The Lisa Stasi Effect which aims to bring awareness to her mother's story and find the answers she still seeks to find closure on. This research project, along with this interview, was an incredibly emotional journey for me personally and I was so honored to have been given some time by Heather. I hope I can serve the memory of her beautiful mother Lisa Stasi in this post and in the video I just completed. # Discussion Points * The likelihood of finding the remains of Lisa Stasi and possible locations where her remains could be found * The reluctance of John Edward Robinson, who is already on death row, to own up to more of the victims he is suspected of in order to give those families closure on the eventual fate of their missing loved ones. * The role of mental health in conjunction with experiencing a traumatic event like what Heather went through. # Sources [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John\_Edward\_Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Edward_Robinson) [http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/437dfks.html](http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/437dfks.html) [https://www.semissourian.com/story/1213856.html](https://www.semissourian.com/story/1213856.html) [http://charleyproject.org/case/lisa-stasi](http://charleyproject.org/case/lisa-stasi) [https://heavy.com/entertainment/2019/10/heather-tiffany-robinson-mother-lisa-stasi/](https://heavy.com/entertainment/2019/10/heather-tiffany-robinson-mother-lisa-stasi/) [https://youtu.be/Q7wP9bzf3YQ](https://youtu.be/Q7wP9bzf3YQ) \- Documentary [https://www.yourtango.com/2019328628/who-is-heather-tiffany-robinson-details-woman-whose-mom-murdered-by-serial-killer-adopted-by-his-brother](https://www.yourtango.com/2019328628/who-is-heather-tiffany-robinson-details-woman-whose-mom-murdered-by-serial-killer-adopted-by-his-brother) [https://www.cnn.com/2002/LAW/10/18/ctv.robinson.trial/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2002/LAW/10/18/ctv.robinson.trial/index.html) For now, this is NightDocs, signing off.",
750,"I’m Lily Madwhip and There’s a Monster Wearing My Dad’s Pajamas[I’m Lily Madwhip and there’s a monster wearing my dad’s pajamas](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/e7wfe3/im_lily_madwhip_and_i_just_want_to_go_home/). “We wager you did not foresee our paths crossing again, little oracle,” says the monster. His name is Astyanax. I remember the last time I saw him. He had just gone through a door into someone’s bedroom and then worms came out of his head and then there was a dog, not a dog coming out of his head but just a dog dog in the room... and a shotgun. The dog didn’t have the shotgun, there was a man with a shotgun. It’s a long story. I barely remember most of it as it is. I’ll have to write it all down in my journal before I forget everything. “Why are you in my dad’s pajamas?” I put up my fists for a fight. They’re small fists. I’m a small person. I wish I had my knife on me. Even a butter knife would be nice. He tugs the pajama pants up because he’s so thin that they keep threatening to fall down. I don’t want to see that. Nobody would. I really hope he’s still wearing that diaper underneath. I don’t think he or anyone else from Snakebutt’s dungeon got to bathe regularly. Adults need to bathe like ten times more than kids do, because once you hit a certain age you just sweat all the time and it smells like rotten eggs. My dad is going to have a fit when he sees this guy in his pajamas. Especially since he’s full of worms. Maybe that’s all he is, just a pile of worms in a human suit. “We were freezing,” he replies, like that’s it. You just show up at someone’s door wearing their dad’s pajamas and shrug it off because you were cold. I could understand if my dad gave him the pajamas, but my dad would never give this guy his pajamas. “What did you do with my mommy and daddy? How did you even get here?” It feels like he walked off on our little group of survivors just a few hours ago. Let me think... faced hekate, got in a knife fight with the school bully, angels showed up, more angels showed up, everything fell apart, we fell through space, landed on a beach, surfers got decapitated... then a car ride home. I’m like 95% sure that the door he went through didn’t lead to my house. That one had a dog and a guy with a shotgun, and we have neither a dog nor a guy with a shotgun in ours. At least I hope we don’t have a guy with a shotgun. I wouldn’t mind the dog. Except that Astyanax tore that dog to pieces. I hope my bedroom isn’t full of dog parts. “We came to repay the life-debt we owe to you,” his mouth moves open and shut. Is it him talking or the worms inside him talking? “We did not think you would survive your encounter with the witch queen--” he pauses to spit after mentioning her, “--so we came to tell your pater and mater of your deeds and your fate.” He glances around at the empty neighborhood. “We would be curious to know what befell her.” “Why are you talking in plural?” I ask. He turns to look at me. His jaw creaks open just a little. Is he going to do his worm trick and tear me apart? Please don’t tear me apart, I just got home. “You saw what we really are. We thought it was safe to speak as we normally do in your presence. Only Lamia knew before you. After her mater twisted us into these... these *dirt-eaters*, Lamia stitched together this suit from bone and flesh with which to imprison and torture us. Imagine having your humanity stolen from you, then forced back upon you in a cruel jest just so they can enact more suffering upon you. We acted as one because-- would you have spared us if you’d seen us as we are?” I didn’t really follow everything he said. “I mean, as long as you didn’t ask me to carry them in my hands, I would save a bunch of worms.” Worms are wiggly and gross, but they make dirt good for farming. At least that’s what I’m told. They must be pretty miserable though because they always seem to commit suicide during rain showers, coming out to lay on the sidewalk and then shrivel up in the sun when the rain stops. “You are more noble than most,” he tugs up my dad’s pajamas again. “If it confuses you, we... I... can speak as you would. Your parents are tied up at the moment. They misunderstood our... my... intentions.” “What are your intentions?” I ask, “Make me freeze to death out here on my own porch after saving your wormy lives?” He still hasn’t explained how he even got here. Astyanax makes a sad face. I wonder how the worms are able to control the body. Do they tug on his brain like puppet strings? Is there a brain? Do they wiggle around under the skin and just give the appearance of emotions? Too many questions, and I’m still out here in the chilly, night air. “I’m sorry,” he says. They say. Whatever. “Please come inside and get warm.” We walk inside. My house is toasty and I’ve missed it more than I realize. I want to cry and hug the couch but that’d probably come off as weird. Upstairs is my bed. I’m ready to just go collapse in it. Somewhere, my parents are tied up too. I need to hug them as well, after untying them but maybe before untying them too. So many emotions, I don’t know what to do, so I just go limp and fall to my knees in the entryway. Astyanax steps toward me with concern. “Are you wounded?” “I’m exhausted,” I tell him. “We will fetch a pair of your father’s pajamas for you.” “I have my own pajamas.” He nods and starts toward the stairs. “No, I don’t want my pajamas either. I just want my mom and dad.” Astyanax comes back and stands near the kitchen door. I can smell coffee coming from inside. Normally I don’t like the smell of coffee, but smelling it now reminds me that I’m home. Inside the Veil, everything smelled old and musty, like a book store or under Nana’s bed. I hid there once... under Nana’s bed, not the bookstore. You can’t hide in a bookstore unless you’re a book. I almost forgot what home smells like, kind of a mix of Mom’s executive perfume and Dad’s Irish soap. And coffee of course. My room smells like a pomander. That’s this thing where you take an orange and stick cloves in it and then hang it somewhere like a little pine tree in a car. I like to make pomanders, but Mom said it’s a waste of an orange so I had to stop. The one in my room has been hanging there since I was six. All the cloves fell out and the orange is just this shriveled, little, gray lump. “We are... no, *I am*... sorry that I had to tie them up, your mater and pater,” Astyanax rubs his arms nervously, a strange tic for worms to have since they don’t have arms. “When I told them of your battle with the witch queen, they accused us... me... of abducting you. Your pater threatened us. Our first instinct was survival, but that would have been a poor showing of our gratitude, slaying your parents. So we tied them up.” I get up and lug myself over to the couch. Sweet, soft couch. I pet its arm and hug it, then flop down on the cushions and look at Astyanax. He seems confused. I knew hugging the couch would look weird. Maybe now he thinks hugging the furniture is a ritual in my house. “So you tied up my parents, then borrowed my dad’s pajamas and... what? Waited for me to return? You thought I was dead. How did you get here? How long have you been wearing my dad’s pajamas?” Time works differently in the Veil. Ohno told me that. At the time, I thought she meant that we could be gone for hours and it would only appear like minutes. Maybe it meant minutes in the Veil would be like days out here. She never bothered to clarify it. Ambrose has been in the Veil for years and he seemed to think it was still whenever he came from. Astyanax seems to go limp. His jaw hangs open and there’s darkness inside. His eyes stare off at nothing. I can see the worms inside him wiggling around in his throat. Maybe they’re having a meeting. A worm meeting. After a minute, the wriggling stops and his eyes swivel back toward me and his mouth clamps shut briefly. “Knowing your name was enough. Everything that lives and wriggles beneath the dirt is our kin. We spoke to them and through them we found you. Your home is well known among those of us who feast on the dead.” “What’s that supposed to mean?” “It took us a long time to get here. We... did things... that are best left unspoken. We would say that it took... days... to get here. And then within hours, you show up. It would seem that Clotho smiled upon us when she spun the thread that is our fates.” Something feels wrong about this. I try not to give it away to the worms with my face but I’m pretty expressive, so I think about it while studying my feet. When I first saw Astyanax, I thought he came to murder me. But he says he came to repay me for freeing him from Snakebutt’s dungeon, even though when he ran out on my book club he seemed pretty angry. He comes to my house and ties up my parents. I don’t see how this counts as payback. “So...” I wiggle my toes in my shoes. “Now that you’ve said thank you, I guess you’re gonna go find a place to live?” Astyanax makes a face like my mom did when I showed her I had learned how to mix her a rum and coke just by watching my Uncle George at every family gathering. “There is no true place for us among men anymore. If you are here, then the witch queen must be gone. With her finally brought down--” he turns and spits again. I wish he’d stop spitting on the floor in my house. “--there is no way for us to be restored. We’ve thought about it, and will likely shed this final prison and join our brethren under the dirt.” I feel bad for him... for them. I don’t know what they were or who they were before Hekate turned them into a pile of worms. What if they were another one of the many like me who she brought into the Veil to use in her weird plan to... I don’t even know what her plan was. Make me fight her to control the Veil only there’s no way to win and Samael was behind it all the entire time or something. It makes my head hurt thinking about it. “I guess this is goodbye. Thanks for not killing my parents.” He smiles. It’s a little gross-looking, because I can see things move beneath the surface of his face as he does it. I half expect a worm to poke out of his nose and in a tiny voice like somebody sucking on a party balloon say, “adios, Lily!” and then wave a tiny hat with a tiny arm. That doesn’t happen though. Instead he turns to the little table where my parents keep their car keys, opens the drawer where Dad sticks the mail he doesn’t like, and pull out Paschar. Or at least, pulls out Paschar’s totem, the doll that I’ve always known as Paschar, only at the moment it’s just a doll because Paschar the angel is somewhere in the Veil. At least I hope he is. Last time I saw him he was fighting Samael in the void before Meredith and I got dumped on a beach. “Paschar!” I almost squeal. I feel the strength return to my legs and I hop to my feet and run over to hug him. More than a couch, more than a bed, more than my dad but not my mom, I want to hug Paschar. But Astyanax holds him up over his head like Roger used to do. It’s called “keepaway” and I hate it when tall people play it with me. The wormbag puts a hand on my shoulder. “Like I said, I came to repay my debt to you.” I hop and reach out for Paschar. “Please give my my dolly!” He looks worriedly at me. “Are you mad, child? We need to destroy this!” I freeze and stare at him. “I beg your pardon?” Astyanax examines the doll in his fancy, black vest and drawn-on tie and nice slacks that my Nana made for him. He seems upset. Maybe he thought the doll was something else. “This is one of the instruments of the seraphim,” he says, “your captors and tormentors. I can sense the connection between it and the other side. Like the trail of a dove carrying messages between the living and the dead.” “No, that’s an angel totem!” “Angel, yes,” he doesn’t seem fazed by this, “another name for the same cruel beings. They toy with us like playthings. Make us fight amongst ourselves, treat us like experiments to do their whims. The worst of them is the lord of that wretched underworld we both escaped.” He means Samael. I agree with that part. Samael is super stinky. I hope he gets stuck in that void and never gets out. I don’t care what the dog angel said about him being important to things. The Veil can be his grave for all I care. The worm-man grips Paschar’s head in his other hand. He twists it, apparently thinking it would rip off, but it’s plastic and not fully attached to his neck, so it just squeaks and twists around. Roger once twisted his head completely off. Mom put it back on, but she’s never been one for toy repair, so it’s been crooked ever since. “Oh!” I cry, “Please don’t do that! His head is a sore spot!” Astyanax clutches Paschar by the torso and legs and tries to snap him in half, but his legs just bend at the sockets. He is clearly getting frustrated. “Accursed thing!” he hisses, then glares at me. “I’m freeing you from them, don’t you understand?” Nothing good ever comes to anyone who messes with Paschar. Roger threw him out a car window and seconds later he was tasting the metal of a truck grill in his face. My dad hid Paschar from me and he ended up getting stuffed in a trunk and getting put in a coma. I don’t know if the doll is cursed like a mummy’s tomb or just weird luck, but it’s happened enough that I just take it for granted now. “Mr. Zanax, Please. I don’t wanna sound like I’m threatening you, but you’re gonna have a real bad time if you don’t give me back my dolly.” His eyes bulge in their sockets and his mouth drops open. “Are you threatening us?” I throw my hands up in exasperation. “I just said I wasn’t doing that!” His jaw goes real loose and then his eyes roll up behind the lids and the top of his head flips back. I can hear this sound like someone pouring out a giant bucket of wet spaghetti. It’s the worms. “WHOA!” I yell, “Whoa! Let’s not do that!” Everything gets still for like half a minute. I know because I started counting my last seconds in my head: 1, 2, 3, and I got all the way up to 32. I count kinda slow though because I gotta think the word twenty over and over and that takes time. All I can hear is the worms in his head slithering about, maybe discussing whether to leap out and rip me to pieces. Are they having a worm mutiny? Maybe not all of them were grateful I freed them. Maybe some of them think gratitude only goes so far. I don’t think any of them are thinking about my warning, because the worms in his hands are straining to snap the plastic doll in half. I know the best they can hope for is pulling his arms and legs and head out, but I can just put that all back in once he’s gone. I hope that’s all he does. “Worm friends,” I swallow the lump in my throat. “That dolly is the totem of Paschar. He’s... uh... the watcher of Elizabeth.” I try to remember everything Paschar said to Hekate. It all seemed very important at the time. I should have paid attention. “Stewmaker of the casserole. And one of the seven potatoes.” I’m pretty sure I got everything wrong there. The top of Astyanax’s head flips back over with a nasty snap. His eyes roll back down and blink at me. “What does any of that mean?” “I have no idea. But he’s very important among the angels. And that doll is his totem. He’s put a, uh... curse on it.” The grip on Paschar loosens and he looks down at the toy. One of the legs of Paschar’s pants has ripped at the seam. Dad’s going to have to sew that back up. “A curse?” I nod and move slowly toward him, holding out my hands. “Anyone who tries to destroy it suffers terribly. Believe me. I’ve seen it happen.” He looks at me, then at the doll. “Do you trust me?” I ask, moving another step closer. I can almost feel the soft felt of Paschar’s clothes on my fingertips. Astyanax turns toward the sliding door to the backyard. He looks out at the trees and bushes and grass like something’s distracted him. After a moment, he turns back to me, his skin wriggling all over with the worms inside him. “The dirt eaters that reside on your land spoke well of you,” he says calmly. “See? They-- wait, the worms talk about me?” I stop. “The worms in my backyard talk about me? Like gossipy talk? What do they say?” He holds out Paschar to me. “They say you are a friend to us. That you have kept them well-fed.” “The worms said that?” Oh cripes, they *are* talking about all my dead pets. I can’t believe the worms are happy they get to eat all my poor babies that we buried in the backyard. That’s so wrong. This bizarre conversation is interrupted by the sound of shattering glass. It’s the sliding door to the backyard, because something super big just got thrown through it. The big thing is like a giant sack of potatoes. It hits the ground with a wet splat and what looks like one of those tumbleweeds you see in Western movies and Wile E Coyote cartoons rolls across the floor and stops between Astyanaxx and me. The tumbleweed has a face. I recognize it because I just got done taking a car trip with it and a talking dog. It’s name was Mortimer, or as I liked to think-- “SANTA!” I scream. I hear Meredith’s voice from outside. “Lily! RUN!” “Run and we’ll peel your little friend like a grape,” comes a voice, only it’s got a funny accent and sounds like “Rune and wail pale yer loddle fran look a greep.” Two dark forms step through the broken glass door. It’s the crispies, Snap and Pop. They’re still wearing the wetsuits they stripped off the surfers. One of them has Meredith under his arm like she’s a piece of luggage, only she’s kicking and slapping at him angrily and suitcases don’t do that. They don’t bite either, like she’s doing to his arm while snarling like a wild animal. He doesn’t seem to care in the least. “People don’t peel grapes!” That’s what I *want* to say, but I’m too busy staring at Mortimer’s lifeless eyes. If his head were still attached to his neck I’d just think he was sleepy. Instead I just say “banana” quietly. Because you peel bananas. Who peels grapes? Maybe headless ghouls like these two do. Snap brushes his hands off on his pants. They’re wet with blood. “We come bearing gifts,” he says, but his funny accent makes it sound more like “we comb boring gafts.” I’m frozen in fear. Jophiel said the crispies were too powerful for me to deal with and now they’re standing in my living room and I don’t even have Paschar to help me. “Who are you?!” shouts Astyanax. He’s still holding Paschar, but not trying to tear the doll apart anymore. He’s got it raised like some sort of weapon instead. “Get out of here!” Yeah, that’ll... that’ll drive them off. Snap looks around the living room. “Noise Hoose.” He looks at me. “Onokole sands her regourds.” I can almost understand him. “Give oos the tootem.” Astyanax and I look at each other. Are we having one of those moments where two people share a thought and make a plan without speaking? Because I got nothing. I’m just trying not to pee my pants. Maybe he is too. That can be a shared thought. Let’s not pee our pants. “They took my Barbie!” Meredith shrieks, “And they killed Mortimer!” Yeah, I can see that. But where’s Jophiel and the doggy? Did they get away? Did the crispies grab Meredith and Mortimer before Jophiel got back to the car? I hope the dog is okay. Snap crunches across the broken glass, stepping past the huge sack of potatoes that was Mortimer’s body. I can hear the carpet squish wetly beneath his feet, probably with Mortimer’s blood. We’re going to have to get that shampooed out. Or more likely mom will just get it all recarpeted. I mean, if we don’t all die. Someone will get it shampooed I guess. He walks up to Astyanax. “You er foother?” he asks, jabbing a thumb my way. He grins. There’s blood on his teeth. It’s probably the surfer’s blood. He puts his other hand out. “Hond it oover.” Astyanax casts me one last look, then turns and glares at him. “Over our dead bodies.” Snap smirks. “Far enoof. Wanna see wot I kin do wit me had?” Astyanax lowers his chin. “Want to see what I can do with mine?” Snap reaches up to grab Astynax by the neck. I’ve seen him do it before, twisting a surfer’s head right off his body so he could wear it like a hat. The head he’s wearing right now, in fact. Because Snap doesn’t have a head of his own. He’s got a hand where his head should be. But Astyanax’s head doesn’t twist off like he planned. Instead, the top of it flops back on the jaw like a hinge. Snap looks genuinely surprised by this. He gets three and a half words out. “Wot the bloody f--” And then a thick tentacle shoots up out of Astynax’s neck. Not a tentacle... worms. Worms wrapped around each other so tightly they look like muscle. They glisten in the moonlight coming from outside, reflected off the broken glass all over the floor. The wormacle pops straight up out of the lower half of Astyanax’s head like one of those stalagmites you see in a cave. Not to be confused with stalactites which are just stalagmites that prefer the ceiling to the floor. C for ceiling, G for ground. That’s how I was taught to remember. The massive worm stalagmite arcs down at the top like a fountain of water and plunges into the top of Snap’s head with a sick cracking sound If it had been Snap’s head, he’d probably be dead. But it’s not, so instead the head just comes right off, sliding down the front of his wetsuit, revealing the weird, blackened hand beneath it, all covered with gross stuff. Pop drops Meredith to the floor like a sack of garbage and drops to his hands and knees behind the couch, probably poised like a tiger about to pounce. A second later he shoots across the room like a missile --a tiger missile I guess-- minus the head he was wearing as a disguise... the hand in its place clenched up like a fat fist. He hits Astyanax like a battering ram. Astyanax flies backward and tumbles over the coat rack by the door to the entryway. His body crumples into a pile while the worms inside him flail out of his neck like an army of angry spaghetti noodles. I can see them latching onto the crispies, wrapping around them like slimy bandages. And just when I think it couldn’t get weirder, that’s when the dog bounds into the room through the broken glass door. I mean, a dog coming inside isn’t weird, but it feels so out of place with the head-hands and the worms and all the blood that it seems kind of surreal to see it running in. It trots over to me and rubs against my leg. I pet it numbly. “Lily!” It’s Jophiel. “Take the collar!” I stare at the two crispies writhing on the floor covered in worms that seem to be trying to squeeze them to death. They tear the little, wriggling bodies by the tens or hundreds, but more just keep coming out of Astynax. Why me? Why’s it always gotta be me? He could have had Meredith take the collar. He could have had anyone take the collar. Why’s it gotta be me? Always me. Always Lily. I hear Paschar in my head. “Lily, take the collar.” He’s home. It’s such a relief to hear his voice, it just makes all the horrors going on across the room seem to fade away. I reach down and unhook the dog’s collar. Almost immediately, everything around me looks brighter, clearer, more colorful. It’s night still, but I can see in the dark as if it’s the sunniest day of Summer. The glass on the floor glitters like diamonds. Even Mortimer --poor Mortimer-- looks less like a sack of potatoes and more like one of those paintings they have in the Museum of Fine Art in Boston. It’s like he was painted with acrylics. Everything is awash in color. The worms are a beautiful pink. The red of Mortimer’s blood is so vibrant it makes me want to cry. “Take the others,” says Paschar. My legs don’t want to move, so instead I reach out with my hand and my mind. I can’t see them, but I sense them... two angels, compacted into plastic and molded into the shape of dolls. They feel me calling to them and come to me, flying across the room from their individual locations and snapping into my hand like a pair of magnets. The world is alive. I can see the nasty, shriveled hearts beating in the crispies’ chests. I can hear the furious beating of ten thousand little worm hearts. I feel the heartbeat of the doggy at my side, and my friend Meredith lying behind the couch. Upstairs in their bedroom, my mom and dad’s hearts are beating fast, frightened by the noises from downstairs. I can even see the last rhythm of Mortimer’s heart in his chest. He has already been judged. “The time of judgment has come.” I can hear myself speaking, but it’s not me. At least, I don’t think I’m saying this. It’s my voice, but I’m busy thinking about how it’s not me even as I’m speaking. It feels like my hair is on fire. Maybe it is. I hope I’m not burning the whole house down. It’s like I’m outside my body, watching, but I’m not, I’m trapped behind my eyes. As if in response, the piles of still-living worms squirm away from the two silently struggling Dullahan. I don’t know why I remember that word now. That’s what they are. Dullahan. Ugly servants of death. Snap flounders on the floor, the hand coming out of his neck grabs the decapitated surfer’s head and puts it back on, then turns and looks at me, half its face covered in blood from the wound the worms made. “Woe unto you, Cian and Donnacha,” I say. That’s their names. I know their names. My voice sounds like thunder. My own heart feels like its going to explode in my chest. It hurts. My whole body is on fire. I raise my arms. “NO!” roars Donnacha. “Behold his wrath,” I whisper. [And then the world goes completely silent, even as the ceiling over our heads disintegrates and the entire room is filled with a pillar of white-hot fire that floods all my senses, blinding me](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/epjvtc/im_lily_madwhip_and_you_can_keep_this/).",
751,"I'm a Beta in LDR with Filipina, Life in Shambles Hi Guys, I'm new here after reading some of Rollo Tomassi's work. I need some help. My life is truly in shambles and I'm not sure how to repair it, or if it can even be repaired. I'm not sure if it's even worth it to try anymore. It's a long post, if you don't have time to read it, it's okay, I understand. I'm nothing special. I'm 33 years old, definitely beta male. I've had a few relationships, first lasting around five years, and second lasting around two years, Third and current lasting about four years. Dated some women in between. I am of mixed race, but born and raised in the US, Chicago. I am still living with mom even at the age of 33, because I am, quite frankly, a loser. I graduated with a bachelor degree from Loyola University in 2011 at age 26 with roughly 50k in student debt and I've been paying it off ever since graduation, going from one job to the next. At the moment I have about 20k left to pay off from my student loans, 14k left to pay on my car, and 10k I owe my parents from a failed business that I tried in 2015. My mom has 3 sisters, all of which tell her to kick me out. They tell her that I'm a loser (which is true) and that I'm pretty much good for nothing (which is also true). Mom cooks and cleans for me (after my car accidnet, which I talk about later in this post). I hate the fact that I'm still living with mom, it makes me feel like a complete loser and it makes me feel like no woman would want me while I'm in the current state that I'm in. When I was 29, I had lost my job at the time, and I was feeling depressed and lonely. I went onto a dating site trying to find a Japanese woman because I have always been into the Japanese culture, but ended up getting a message from a Filipina living in the Philippines and we started chatting a little at first and it ended up turning into a long distance relationship. She is 2 years younger than me and she has a child from what she says was rape (we met when her child was 4 years old). Her boss, about 20 years older than her, from one of her previous jobs had raped her. She was dumb and thought that she could learn to love him, so she went back to the job and he ended up raping her again. Then she left – and she said she never spoke to him, or saw him again – EVER. (which would turn out to be a lie). At times she would get sick, or her daughter would get sick, or someone in her family would get sick and I would send some money to help with the hospital bills. It would turn out to be about $425 total in 2016. A while later in 2016, I had a little bit of money saved up, so I used some of it to take a one month long trip to the Philippines and I met this woman. We met in Cebu and I had taken her a lot of gifts, and we took a little vacation around the islands in the area. We went to Malapscua and Bantanyan and then came back to Cebu. Next we were planning on going to Bohol and Panglao, which are further south, but I was feeling tired and my feet were hurting (I have plantar fasciitis) and I wanted to stay an extra day in Cebu to relax and plan the rest of the trip a little better. She got very upset and asked me ""what is the problem"" in a horrible tone. At the time I gave a very beta answer of ""nothing"" and we proceeded on with the vacation, not taking that extra rest day. Before I left, she asked me for some money, a couple hundred dollars to pay for her rent for that month that we were together, so I gave her $200. The sex was great, maybe even amazing. It was the best sex that I have had with a woman. I'm not that experienced, having only been in two relationships prior but I do enjoy sex with this current girlfriend. I came back to the US and I found a good job, one that I excelled in and really enjoyed. I was finally making decent pay at the end of 2016, a full 5 years after college graduation at $21 hourly. The jobs I had right after graduation would pay me between $14 - $17 hourly. So I was really happy and excited about my new job. Around this time, I also started my own small business online. The business started slow and eventually started making about $200 - $500 monthly (winter months are more profitable than summer months) in profits. So now I'm feeling really good. I needed to hire employees for my business, so I hired my girlfriend and her sister. I started paying the girlfriend about $200 monthly, and the sister about $150 monthly. I know that's not a lot of money here in the US, but for them in the Philippines, it is a substantial amount of money. My girlfriend lives in Cebu, but her daughter lives 3 hours away in Leyte with grandma (my girlfriend's mother). Now I'm planning a second trip to go to the Philippines in September 2017. I set up 2 days at the end of the trip to meet with the daughter. My girlfriend said she would have grandma bring the child to Cebu so I can meet the child and we can have a few days together. When I got to the philippines, we traveled for about 2 weeks and on one of those nights I had a horrible dream and I was yelling in my sleep. I woke up, and she started screaming at me telling me that I scared her and told me never to touch her again. At this point I was semi aware that I had a nightmare and I was shouting in my half asleep state, but her outburst was surprising. She started packing her things, planning to leave me right there on that island that we were visiting. Like a good BETA male, I calmed her down and she came back to bed. It's now near the end of the trip, and she tells me that I will not be meeting the daughter, because the daughter suddenly got sick and would not be able to come. I thought it was a bit weird, but I accepted it. On the very final day, she revealed to me that she had an ex boyfriend for 4 years. At this point, we had been together about 2 and a half years and I had no idea about this ex boyfriend. I got upset, and she lied, telling me that she's told me about him before. Uhhh I think i'd remember that. Well, I go back to the US, and it turns out she got pregnant. She had been on the pill. She has a miscarriage and there are a lot of emotions. She accuses me of never wanting the child because it would tie me down to her. It's not true, but her accusation hurts a lot. I still have the same job I had and another year passes, I'm paying her now about $300 monthly because she says she's not eating and barely able to get by on the $200 I had been sending her up to this point. My small business is in the red because I'm paying her too much for the work she's doing. My girlfriend is supposed to be working fulltime, but when I do the monthly tally, it turns out she's working most months at an average of 40%. Should be working 160 hours monthly, but is working about 64 hours monthly. What is she doing with her time? I confront her and she gets upset. She says she's working and if I don't like her work I can fire her. Being BETA, I do nothing. She apologizes and starts working a little bit harder. I still don't really know what she had been doing with all her extra time if she wasn't working. Another boyfriend? Maybe, maybe not. My third and final trip was June of 2018 for her birthday. She turned 30 and I went with a ring to propose to her. Again we scheduled a few days at the end of the trip to try to meet her daughter for the third time, but there was another excuse that the daughter was sick AGAIN and would not be able to meet me. I was very upset and fuming. We were having a good night, but went back to the hotel and i was thinking about leaving her, but being BETA, I didn't. The next day, I overslept quite a lot and missed the date night we had set up – she was in the room but did NOT wake me up. She started slamming the lights off and went in the bathroom and slammed the door. When she came out, she slammed the door again. It felt like abuse. I overslept, because of the time difference from the US to the Philippines, its about 13 hours difference, and she couldn't understand it. It was a horrible experience. We had an okay rest of the week. Great sex, going out, doing things. Now it's the day of her birthday and I'm thinking about if I am going to propose or not. For lunch we went to the mall and we're going to a japanese restaurant to eat ramen, but along the way we pass by a bakery, so I simply said to her there's a bakery, we can get you a birthday cake. OMG her eyes turned into daggers as she turned and SHOUTED at me ""I AM HUNGRY, WE WILL EAT FIRST!!"" Again being Beta, I did nothing, but this incident was enough to get me to take a step back and think OK I am NOT going to propose tonight, so I ended up not proposing and not meeting the daughter. I went back to the US and my birthday came around September of 2018, and guess what? She forgot my birthday. I had gone there for her birthday with intent to propose on that day, but I wasn't important enough for her to remember my birthday. I confronted her about it and she came up with a lie that she remembered and she even bought me a cake and balloons. So I asked her for the picture of the cake and balloons and she couldnt come up with the picture. A FULL DAY LATER she sent me a picture of a cupcake saying happy birthday. The balloon? A neighborhood kid liked it, so she gave the balloon to the kid. Anyway, at this point I'm ready to leave her but I still can't, there's something in me that thinks I'm not good enough for someone else. So I stay with her. End of year 2018 I get in a car accident. Other driver made an illegal left turn into oncoming traffic (where I was going through a green light) and hit me. I had a severe concussion, memory problems, difficulty thinking. I have neck problems, back problems. My vision is not good anymore, I'm seeing huge inky black spots in the center of my vision, takes up about 20% of my field of vision. I have ringing in my ears twice daily. I'm also scared shitless to drive again, or even leave the house. For almost a year now since the accident I have been severely depressed. My mother has been giving/lending me money for the few things that I need. I lost my job because I could not return to it in the condition that I am in, and my lawyer has been fighting for me, but so far no money has come to me yet and no settlement has been reached. Now it's end of June 2019 and my girlfriend and I are talking about marriage like we have a few times before but we get deeper into the subject. She says she wants to come to the US and bring her daughter here. I asked her to see the birth certificate of her daughter. She said there is no birth certificate. Then I ask what is the full name of the child. She gives me a complete different name of the child than what she had been calling the child for our entire 4 yr relationship. She finally reveals that the rapist father named the child. I said WTF I thought you had no contact with him after the rape. She says she needed money to deliver the child at the hospital so he had to pay and he named the child. I said OK, then if he named the child, the Philippine government would need his permission to leave the Philippines, and the US government would need his permission for the child to enter the US. Then she reveals HE IS VISITING THE CHILD ON A REGULAR BASIS ALL ALONG. So now he can give his permission. WHAT THE FUCK. I say I thought you had no contact with him. She says it's true she has no contact with him, but her mother allows him to come and visit the child at grandma's house in Leyte. I ask her when and how often does he come to visit her. She says she doesnt know. She says he lives in Manila, which is on the other side of the fucking country. But he comes to visit her from time to time so now he can give his permission to let the child come to the US. WTF Is this bullshit. I poke and prod more and more and finally she reveals more details that this guy is her 4th cousin 7 times removed or some bs like that. And that he was there to comfort her after her ex boyfriend had broken up with her and he gave her that job. WTF IS GOING ON HERE. At this point end of June 2019, I felt like my heart had been ripped out and I know for sure she is a pathological liar. I asked her why she didn't tell me all these things before and she responded saying ""I didn't think we were serious about our relationship."" WTF, after I went there 3 fucking times and spent tons of money on each trip. After four years! She thought we weren't serious!? I ended the relationship, fired her and her sister from working in my business and not sending them another penny, and we didn't talk again for about two months, until mid September 2019. She tells me she is working 2-3 jobs now and barely making it. She says she cries at work all day long. She says she can't stop thinking about me. She says she loves me so much. She said she is suicidal without me and she tried commiting suicide by taking a bottle of pills, but her stomach hurt really bad and she ended up calling the ambulence. She says she is now living with a female roomate. So I called her on webcam, she didnt answer. I called her again and she answered. I asked her to show me the room, and she said the female roomate was there so she didnt feel comfortable showing me. I told her I didn't care and to show me anyway, so she showed me and there was no roomate there. I asked her why she lied and she says she didnt feel comfortable showing me the small space she was living in so she lied about the female roomate being there. I told her that she's a liar and that I question every single thing in our relationship for the entire four years we'd been together. A few days later, she moved from that place to her sister's place, but says she can only stay with her sister for one month and then she needs to move somewhere else, or move back to Leyte with her mother and daughter. I felt sorry for her and sent her $30 – which is equal to about a weeks worth of work there. So that's where I am right now with my relationship. I feel torn. I know she's a pathological liar and she's very likely lied about many things in our relationship. Hell, the whole relationship was based on a lie. Her rapist is visiting her daughter all along. I was willing to be a beta male for her and be the daddy to her daughter, but she denied me even that, not allowing me to see the daughter all three times I went there. So I wasn't good enough to see the daughter when I visit, but I am good enough to bring her and her daughter to the US? When I think about it like this, I think HELL NO, i'm not going to do that. But then I get so lonely and depressed and I think about her and I want her back. Currently we're staying in contact and talking, but there is definitely a huge rift between us. She is a very beautiful woman 10/10, but she's a horrible person on the inside. I've only been with her in person for a total of about two months out of a nearly four year relationship. In the US the law is that if I bring her and her child here, then I will be financially responsible for all of their needs for a full ten years – even if we get a divorce, I'm still responsible. Just this fact makes me think 10 times over if I really wanna bring her – or anyone outside the country – to this country. I have given her a total of $7,900 over our four year relationship – of which profits from her work in my business will eventually recover. I spent about $4,000 on each one of my three trips there, totaling roughly $12,000.How do I break free of her? I know I have to, but it's just so fucking hard. How do I move out of my mother's house? I don't have a job right now and I'm not sure how much money my lawyer will be able to collect from my car accident. The family pressure from my aunts and uncle is heavy. They all think I'm a loser and taking advantage of my mother. I think it's true too. But I have been dealt a pretty bad hand. I never should have gone to college, racking up all that debt. Only afterwards did I realize how stupid it was. I don't know. I feel like I'm generally a pretty dumb guy, maybe the dumbest guy in the room. My mother is a very kind woman, she takes care of me without complaining. I love her a lot and I want to do right by her. I want pay her back everything that she's loaned me, and I want to be a good son to her, but right now I'm just not in a good place financially, physically, emotionally. Does anyone see a path for me, or is this it? Maybe it's better to not even try.",
752,"Popular Youtuber Advocates Aborting Autistic/Mentally Handicapped People in the Womb: An Open Letter from An Autistic Person to Unnatural VeganHello everyone, Faye Fahrenheit here. I made an hour an 17 minute long response video to Unnatural Vegan, because she advocated aborting mentally handicapped and autistic people in the womb. # You can watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpOYDxJAV6I), but I had a few important things to add: I am autistic, and when I was 16 my mother abandoned me and my older brother who was both mentally handicapped and terminally ill. I cared for him while going to high school, and got him into a living facility for people with his needs, and made him comfortable while died. He died when I was 19. I say this because I have been a caregiver. My brother couldn't use the bathroom without help and wore diapers until his dying day. My brother was afraid of the shower because he fell in it once and so I had to help him bathe. He needed a lot of help, and I loved him much. RIP Jeremy 2010. As for me, I have struggled with autistic self injury, ripping my own hair out, plucking my eyelashes out, and picking huge crators in my skin. In her video she claims neurodiversity advocates are the people who never suffered because of their disabilities and I'm here to say that's 100% untrue. Both myself and my mentally handicapped brother were supporters of the Neurodiversity Movement. She also seems to think caregivers aren't part of the movement, and I'm here to say I was a caregiver. I have also worked professionally with people who have Down's, nonspeaking autistics, on dementia wards, and on hospice as a personal care provider. Now, onto my major criticisms of her video: # Unnatural Vegan's Video and why its (unintentionally???) ableist: She made a video about a raw food vegan feeding her kid a raw vegan diet to ""cure"" the autism. I like the idea of the video, and I appreciate that she's coming out against anti vaxxers however, but unfortunately half way through her video, she began to start promoting misinformation, myths, and outright lies about the [Neurodiversity Movement](https://autisticadvocacy.org/2017/02/autism-and-the-disability-community-the-politics-of-neurodiversity-causation-and-cure/), which is a civil rights movement. She states in the video that she knows you can't make an autistic brain not autistic-it's how we developed in the womb, some areas of the brain are overdeveloped, others are underdeveloped. For example I was reading at a college level before kindergarten, but as an adult I've yet to master driving a car. Autistic people are difficult to categorize, and the terms ""high functioning"" and low functioning"" have fallen out of favor, with the current DSM referring to autistic people via support levels(the kind of help you need) instead. **In her video she either lies about or clearly doesn't understand the neurodiversity movement. Here is a list of her claims I take issue with:** &#x200B; * She states this she states that she is in favor of a prenatal test to abort autistic people in the womb. She uses the fact that some autistic people can't live on their own, and are mentally handicapped to support her belief that this is a good thing. * She states that \*ALL\* neurodiversity or autism rights advocates ""have mild aspergers"" which is ""a big problem with the neurodiversity movement"". This is categorically and completely untrue, and in my video I feature countless nonspeaking and severely autistic advocates and activists. Nonspeakers were the some of the founders and forerunners of our movement. Five minutes of googling would have shown her countless severely autistic advocates. * It's also really not cool to call someone ""mildly autistic"" because it's kinda like saying they have ""a little bit of Down's"" or are ""mildly pregnant"", or ""you aren't black, not like black-black"". This is not to deny that some of us need way more support than others. That's why the DSM uses support levels now. * She states that neurodiversity advocates think autism ""is just living differently"". This is not true, and possibly a strawman, if intentional. The Neurodiversity movement is **very specifically a disability rights movement. We think that autism is a developmental disability, and no neurodiversity charity has ever stated otherwise.** * She doesn't seem to know if we support treatments or not, clearly demonstrating a lack of research. Neurodiversity advocates support all treatments and therapies that are humane and respect the autistic person's identity and self. * She overplays the ableism we face, by dismissing fears of a ""cure"". In my video, and below(under Nazi Stuff) I talk about why autism rights advocates opposed using the term ""cure"". This is represented in her video as if we believe that autistic people aren't disabled and don't need any help and it's ""just living differently"" but that's nonsense and not actually why we oppose using the term ""cure"". * She talks down to autistic people in the video at several points, dismisses the opinions of autistics on their own disability. * She includes videos on why Autism speaks is bad news, but unfortunately, she either isn't aware of the fact that Autism Speaks is a Eugenics organization pretending to be a charity that helps disabled people, or she doesn't care. The history of eugenics and current attempts at eugenics against us aren't mentioned once. * I didn't respond to this in my video but it irritates the hell outta me that she implies the **only** successful person with classic autism is Temple Grandin(**Wtf**???), and I hope the sheer number of nonspeakers and severely autistic people I included in my video makes up for it. * She never once mentions that neurodiversity advocates are working towards extremely important goals, like ending [the use of electric shock on the handicapped](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Judge_Rotenberg_Educational_Center). She portrays a legitimate civil rights movement for extremely marginalized people as a group of delusional people who think autism is a bed of roses. * She frames the neurodiversity movement as something that blames parents and stands opposed to parents. This is a blatant strawman, and she presents the false choice of having to choose between supporting neurodiversity and blaming parents. Nonsense. Many neurodiversity advocates are parents! * Aside from Greta Thunberg the only neurodiversity supporters she shows are Instagram commenters. Not once is any charity, like The Autistic Society UK, Aspies for Freedom, or the Autistic Self Advocacy Society. Blatant misrepresentation or just ignorance? * She has a huge platform and is using it to misrepresent a civil rights movement for a group of people with an average age of death of 36-38(largely due to suicide) # Nazi Stuff ""Cure"" has been a euphemism for killing, torturing, or otherwise abusing autistics and it's a derogatory term that goes all the way back in autism treatment. Starting with Hans Asperger, the Nazi Doctor who selected which children would be ""cured"" aka euthanized by the child euthanisia program the nazis were running, and which children would be spared death. Blood filtering treatments, feeding children bleach, electric shock treatments, beatings, exorcisms, therapies based on [gay conversion therapy](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Applied_behavior_analysis), and many, many more have been marketed as ""cures"". [The history of controversial therapies marketed as ""cures"" can be found here, on Rationalwiki's page for The Autism Rights Movement.](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Autism_rights_movement) Hypothetical prenatal tests designed to flag autistic fetuses so they cant be aborted have also been called ""cures"" many times, and nazis as well as the alt right have used ""cure"" as a euphemism for the killing of, or abuse of the disabled. Unatural vegan says she supports a prenatal test for autistics, aka ***eugenics***, in her video. **Autistic people can't be cured because autism isn't an illness, it's a permanent developmental disability, like Down's Syndrome.** **Suggesting you can ""cure"" autism is like saying you can unbake a loaf of bread. Autism is how the bread baked in the oven. Can you unboil an egg?** **Would you suggest to a person with Down's that we can change the number of chromosomes they have? No?** This is ***NOT*** to say we oppose legitimate therapies or treatments, we simply oppose the use of the term ""cure"" both for accuracy reasons(legit treatments are called other things) but also because autistic people dislike the history of the term ""cure"" in relation to how it's been used to justify abusing us. Autistic people are still being subject to inhumane ""cures"" ***today***, and for this reason, the term ""cure"" can be triggering for a person who was forced to eat bleach as a child. The term ""cure"" is so widely hated in the autistic community that it has been turned into a slur, ""*curebie*"", which is used in our community to say that we think someone is a eugenicist nazi. If you get called a *curebie* that usually means that the autistic person you're talking to thinks you're a supporter of eugenics. Again, always remember that to us we don't hear cure. We hear ""cure"". It's a Dogwhistle. This is why autism right advocates say, ""Autism is not an *illness*, it does not need a cure."" What we're saying is that it's a ***disability***, and needs to be treated like a ***disability***. Autism, like Down's, is also part of who a person is, and most autistics consider is to be both a disability and a part of our identity. For this reason, implying that a child's disability is a bad thing can be hurtful, and again, you'd never tell a person with Down's, ""I don't hate you, I hate your Down's"" so please don't say things like this to us. Even if you mean well, it's disrespectful. # Terms to use instead: Therapy, speech therapy, CBT, treatments, medications, etc. Literally any other term than the one actual eugenics promoters use. # Why this is important: Myths about the civil rights movement for autistic people are frequently used to dismiss activists. We are facing real issues and just like how conservatives lied about gay rights and trans rights and BLM, they're lying about us. You can find a list of myths about neurodiversity [HERE](http://www.thinkingautismguide.com/p/so-youre-doing-story-about.html) and the position statements of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network [HERE](https://autisticadvocacy.org/about-asan/position-statements/). A lot of alt righters benefit from derailing the autism rights/neurodiversity movements. [Here is an excellent primer on Alt Right figures lying about the autism Rights movement by the Aspergian, a famous Neurodiversity Blog.](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Autism_rights_movement) Help us fight the misinformation. Please don't let uneducated Youtubers promote lies or myths about a very real civil rights movement. Thank you for reading, and watching my video. I'd love it if you shared it because I worked hard on it and he topic is close to my heart.",

With the new year coming up, I’ve been reflecting a lot on myself, my actions, and who I want to be. While certainly not everyone will agree with what I do, I am comfortable right where I am. Moving forward, I am resolving to remain even more conscious of my own mental health so I do not end up in a situation similar to the client I am going to write about today. I met with this man around this time last year. He was likely in his fifties and appeared quite tall and strong. He had short cropped salt and pepper hair, looking somewhat “rough around the edges” in a dark leather jacket. As I opened my door, he greeted me with a sturdy – almost painful – handshake. I granted him entry to my residence by stepping aside and gesturing down the hallway to the living area. “Sir, please take a seat on the couch. I’ll join you momentarily,” I directed. The man moved ahead of me and located the sofa. He dropped down into the cushion with an exasperated sigh. I followed him soon after with my chair from the dining room table in tow. I positioned the chair to face him and settled in. “Thank you for having me,” the man stated gruffly. “I’m glad I found you. I’d heard rumors about you, I’m surprised to know you’re actually real.” I nodded in response. “Yes, I realize I can be hard to reach… but that’s just for my own safety. Before we begin, did you bring payment?” He passed me a small brown paper bag, the kind you would presume to find a bottle of liquor concealed within. I accepted the sack, opening it to quickly verify its contents. “I don’t want you to think that I’m an alcoholic or anything. I used to drink a lot, but I don’t anymore. It ruined my life,” he started with a long sigh. I crossed my legs and leaned forward, propping my head on one hand. “How so?” The man shook his head in long, slow motions, apparently pained by the memories. “When I was deep in the clutches of my addiction, I lost my daughter. I was too wasted to pick her up from school… in fact, I was so far gone I didn’t even realize it was a school day. My wife had left me by that point, so I was the only one looking out for her,” he muttered. “I failed at that completely. She was never found.” “Sir, I’m so sorry. No parent should ever have to go through the loss of their child,” I offered in reassurance, knowing it was not enough. “Well, it was my fault entirely. If I hadn’t been at that same goddamn bar every day, she would be alive,” he conceded. “The only positive thing that came out of that situation was that I cleaned up my act. I never returned to that wretched place again, and I actually became a private investigator. While I’ve never been able to locate my daughter, I have helped other families reunite with their own children,” the man explained as he reached into his pocket to retrieve his wallet, handing it to me. I grasped the wallet, unsure of his intentions. Upon unfolding the leather exterior, I noted several pictures of young children enclosed in small plastic sheaths. I flipped through each photograph before returning the item. The man smiled for the first time as he proudly explained, “those are all children I have brought home to their parents, many of them alive. Turns out I’m pretty good at my job.” The man scoffed at himself. “If only I hadn’t thrown away most of my life on the bottle before I figured that out.” “That’s incredible, sir,” I declared, tucking a loose strand of dark chestnut hair behind one ear. His smile faded almost instantly. “Yes, indeed it was.” He paused for a moment, thoughtfully running the pad of his thumb over the stubble that covered his chin. “I’ve been working the case of a missing young boy. I often get hired on missing persons cases because, in my opinion, the police do a shit job. They declare young kids to be runaways and then get this laser focus on one suspect regardless of what the evidence says. They don’t care about justice, they only want to close a case,” he ranted, tightening his fists. “I think I’m allowed to feel this way, as this is essentially what they did with my daughter.” I bobbed my head. “I can imagine I would feel the same way if I was in your situation.” “Thank you for that,” he responded, his voice softening. “I’ve been working this case for a few months, and I just got a promising tip a couple weeks ago. Through speaking with some of the boy’s neighbors – a job which the police *should* have done – I found that the kid had been seen with a local man the day he disappeared,” he stated. “When I looked into him and found his picture, the first thing I thought was… shit. I know that guy.” I raised one eyebrow in confusion. “How did you know him?” With his eyes locked on the ground, the man clarified, “I recognized him from the bar that I used to frequent. I actually spoke to him a few times. He would brag about his sexual exploits often. I thought he was a real jerk, but I never turned him away if he wanted to sit with me because he’d always buy me drinks. When I understood that this man could have been a child abductor, I just…” the man choked, tears forming in his eyes. “I just couldn’t stop wondering if perhaps those explicit tales he had recounted in my presence involved children.” I shook my head gently, allowing the man to feel whatever he needed before proceeding further. “Naturally, I knew I had to follow up on that lead. I was convinced I’d catch the guy, send him to jail, be a hero,” the man continued, laughing in spite of himself. “Nothing ever turns out the way you expect it to though, right? So, I decided to go undercover. It would be my hardest job yet, pretending to be an actual pedophile,” he explained, sounding almost sick to his stomach. “Were you able to gain his trust?” I asked cautiously. He nodded his head, yes. “I was sweating bullets when I showed up to that awful bar again, worrying he would recognize me,” the man divulged. “Luckily, though, I have changed a lot over the years. I lost a lot of weight when I quit drinking and started exercising regularly. I didn’t give a single shit about my appearance before, either. I walked around with greasy hair down to my shoulders and this gross scraggly beard,” the man elaborated, using his hands to demonstrate the extraordinary length his facial hair had grown to. “Plus, we were wasted – both of us, all of the time. I hardly spoke to him, so I didn’t think he would recognize my voice. It seemed I was right. When I took a seat next to him, he had no idea who I was.” “What happened next?” I urged, unsure of what to expect. The man grimaced. “Honestly, you don’t even want to know. Essentially, I convinced him that I was a pedophile who was interested in abducting a child to satisfy my sick… *needs*. It took a little while, but eventually he agreed to take me out for a drive to explain everything he knew about the subject,” he replied, rubbing each of his thumbs along the side of his index fingers, the skin reddening with each stroke. “He picked me up at eight, and we went on a tour of his perversion.” I shuddered at the thought. “Yeah, that’s how I felt. I was both nervous and disgusted. He drove me to each of the spots from which he abducted children, then we’d stop at each and he’d describe the tortures he put each child through,” the man elaborated as he began to cry. He moved his hands to shield his face, seemingly embarrassed by the emotional reaction. He finally placed his hands back in his lap as he added, “I did find my boy. The lead was correct. The man steered us to just down the street from the boy’s house, then explained that he snatched him as he was playing outside. He kept him for three days, beating and molesting him. Ultimately, he stuffed a bunch of leaves down his throat and held his hand over his face until he suffocated.” I massaged the center of my forehead, sore from furrowing my brow in concern. The man wept openly as we sat wordlessly for several minutes. He composed himself enough to resume, “I could’ve stopped him there, had him drop me off at home. I had the recording of his confession, and he had provided me with plenty of avenues for further investigation of physical evidence. Something kept me there, though. I needed to know about the others. I didn’t know how many more there were, but I’d listen to them all.” “How many were there?” I inquired. “More than you could possibly believe,” the man cried. “I listened for hours as he reminisced smugly on every vile deed he had ever committed. He kept these kids alive for days, torturing them, aroused by the sounds of their cries. I’d had more than I could possibly stand when he stopped the car in a strangely familiar place, claiming it as the site of his first abduction.” I cocked my head to one side as I waited for him to explain further. “My old house,” he murmured solemnly. “I just stared up at the structure, completely dumbstruck. I knew then that I was face to face with my daughter’s killer, and I was acting like he was my best pal. But then another thought struck me. We didn’t live in that house anymore when my daughter disappeared.” Puzzled, I pressed, “then why were you there?” The man hung his head as he responded, “I lived there with my wife and daughter before she left me. Or, at least I *thought* she left me… I was such a worthless drunk, I didn’t even begin to suspect she had met with foul play. This motherfucker detailed every last moment of her final hours. Apparently, he had played the sounds of a crying infant on a tape recorder. Of course, my wife came out to come to assist,” he sobbed. “From there, he seized my wife and subjected her to the worst fate I could imagine. Threatening to come back for our daughter, he forced her to break her own legs with a sledgehammer. This disgusting fuck laughed as he recalled drilling a hole into her skull to end her life. I’ll never forget that sick grin he had on his face as he explained that the hole wasn’t *just* for killing her.” The man was hysterical now, ramming his fists into the couch cushions as he moaned in agony. “Sir… I – I’m so sorry,” I breathed, unsure of how to respond. “It gets worse,” the man said, his voice now disturbingly monotonous. “Apparently, the man had been looking for my daughter that night – I just happened to be out with her at the time. But, according to him, my wife looked young enough to still get him off. He’d never stopped longing for my daughter, but the two of us moved out of that place pretty soon after my wife left – died,” he said, his voice splintering as he corrected himself. “I couldn’t afford the rent anymore, so we moved to the other side of town. The bad side of town. Right into *his* neighborhood,” the man added, laying his forehead in one palm. “My daughter was walking home from school on that shit day, because I *forgot* her, and walked right past that bar as the man stepped out for a smoke. Imagine my ecstasy, he said, when the girl I’d been fantasizing about ever since the beginning skipped right into me,” he snarled, digging his fingernails into one palm. I just stared at the man. The man’s anger melted away into despair once more. “He nailed her to a tree in a wooded area, returning daily to assault her. My little girl lived for eight days in this absolute hell before she ultimately perished due to exposure. It was cold, and that awful snowstorm last year finally took her,” the man choked through tears. He continued through gritted teeth, “The man said, it was like the thrill of my first kill all over again, but *better*.” “Did you leave then?” I asked. “No, I did not,” the man admitted. “When you lose control of yourself, it really is like what they say in the movies. I literally saw red. I was hardly aware of what I was doing, but I knew I was killing him. It took me a bit to realize and fully understand what I’d actually done to him. I’d taken the bottle of beer he’d been drinking and shoved it inside of him, wanting - *needing* him to feel what those poor kids must have felt. I took a hammer I found in his trunk and struck the bottom of the bottle, shattering it. Then I beat him past the point of death. I… I don’t think I deserve to live after this. And I don’t know if I can.” I covered my mouth with one hand, eyes widening. “Sir, that’s all I need to hear. If you’re ready, I’ll prepare the injection.” Something I have not yet mentioned in any of my cases is that I do give my clients one final opportunity to back out of the procedure before we begin. I am generally sure of my judgment by the time I offer, but I like to go the extra ten percent to avoid regretting my actions. Usually, just as I’m about to finish preparing the needle, I’ll call from the other room, “are you absolutely sure that you want to go through with this?” I let the client answer this question alone, so as to avoid any potential pressure from my presence. This time, the man raised his voice to respond, “you know what, I’m actually not sure.” “Why not?” I asked, wandering to the doorframe to more easily discuss his reasoning. The man exhaled an exaggerated sigh. “Well, to be honest, I want nothing more than to die right now. I’ve killed an abhorrent man, true, but regardless of his behavior… I need to answer for this. More importantly, I can’t let the truth about what happened to my wife and daughter die with me,” he explained, tears silently slipping from his eyes. “It’s just not right.” I nodded gently, making my way back to my seat. “I know, sir. I must admit, I just sat in there for a few minutes instead of readying the injection. I could sense a hint of apprehension in your voice towards the end there,” I confessed, reaching down to the floor where I had stashed the paper bag to return his payment. After he had reclaimed the bag, I placed my hand atop his. “You have done an awful thing, but you are still a good man. You feel guilt for the mistakes you have made throughout your life. I would have killed you if you wanted, but I know this is not the path you truly want to take. I respect that. The man you are deciding to be right now… your daughter [would be proud](https://www.reddit.com/r/hercreation/).” [I](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dyeb0f/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [II](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dzjr8q/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [III](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/e01n9m/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [IV](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/e12izn/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [V](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/e4t824/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [VI](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/e5uzer/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [VII](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/e7ptwn/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [VIII](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/eb6dot/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [IX](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ebpjoc/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | [X](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/eeyl14/i_help_people_commit_suicide_but_they_have_to/) | XI",
754,"The 'Prophet', The 'King', The Exile - Return of Lucien Micheaux*""In Africa they knew him as Thoth, and the Dorians called him Hermes. But his name was Trisheros, Thrice-Burned, Thrice-Fooled, Thrice-Corpse. Look upon his head, ye punies, and despair.""* *** #General Info: * **Current age:** 16 * **Birthday:** January 6th, 2018 * **Full name:** Lucien Alphonse Micheaux * **Aliases:** * Iatrokles Soter, King of Eborikos and Savior of Olympus * **Birthplace:** Gaspé, Quebec * **Demigod-Related Conundrums:** Dyslexia, although he lacks ADHD (and the inherent combat awareness that it gives to most demigods) *** #Favorite Things: * **Foods:** Pie. Dear gods, he would kill someone for a pie. Zeus you owe him some fucking pie. You too, Mina. There's also apples slices dipped in elixir, but those are more a medicine than a snack. * **Drinks:** For some unknown reason, he has an unhealthy obsession with brewing his own (mostly harmless) potions and drinking them. This is probably due to a lack of willing lab rats. * **Media:** He doesn't really ever get close enough to things like TV and cell phones anymore, but whenever possible he doesn't mind picking up books to read. Dyslexia does often make it difficult, but it certainly isn't impossible. *** #Family: Member | Name | Age | Relationship ---|---|---|--- Mother | Yvette Micheaux | 38 | Lucien hasn't seen her since he was 8, and although they had an okay and loving relationship, he has no reason or intention to look for her now. He wishes her no ill will, but she really just isn't on his list of priorities. Father ^^([?]) | Circe | N/A | The Greek Goddess of Sorcery. That's all she really is to Lucien. From his claiming he knows she's meant to be his godly parent, and although he was initially very confused on how that was possible, he chooses not to think on it. He tends to resent all the gods, and due to her lack of blessings, Circe is at the top of his list. *** #Friends: Moniker | Name | Age | Relationship ---|---|---|--- 'Roi' | Jaufres | ??? | Jaufres, often just called 'Roi' sarcastically by Lucien, is a Hyperborean giant from a clan that at one point resided in the very north of Canada. Jaufres is the only survivor of this clan, as the rest died long ago in some bloody conflict. The two met when the Hyperborean found him in the woods long ago, and the giant served as a young Lucien's only defense against the mythological world for years. Originally, Jaufres perished in the defense of the Remnant Camp, leaving Lucien to escape into wild unprotected. Due to the Mycenaean Crisis and Kronos shattering time, Lucien was able to experience his last few months with Jaufres once more, allowing himself to show his true feelings to the giant before he inevitably lost him again. 'Spooky' | Mina Gray | 18 | Mina was among the very few campers that Lucien got along with, following his first arrival at camp. The two of them were a part of the suicidal quest to save Zeus during the cull, and during their days of travel Lucien grew to actually like her company. While the two were far from similar people, he was taken away from Long Island by the shattering of time, making him unable to interact with Mina after the Cull was over. She owes him pie. *** #Items and Equipment: Type | Name | Age | Description ---|---|---|--- Metal Crown | ['Crown of the *Roi*'](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/1/1a/King_in_the_North_crown.png/revision/latest?cb=20170801225358) | ??? | An open circlet of hammered celestial bronze, surmounted by nine black iron spikes in the shape of longswords. This crown was presumably forged for the leader of some Hyperborean clan, and following their destruction the only person to inherit it was Jaufres. It's the reason Lucien would always call his protector 'Roi', and although it has no magical properties, Lucien wears it on his belt as a keepsake nowadays. Sword | 'Promethean Khopesh' | <1 | A Celestial Bronze *Khopesh* forged by Forgemaster Brandon. When activated, the blade flickers to life and displays the scene of Prometheus stealing fire and giving it to humanity. When not in use, it can be made into a simple bronze ring. Trophy | 'Skull of Trisheros' | ??? | The skull of Trisheros, the deified mortal in the Mycenaean pantheon that apparently served as a spiritual predecessor to the Greek Hermes and the Egyptian Thoth. During the cull, the alchemist had been reduced to to being a semi-divine mortal hell-bent on proving himself and regaining godhood. Through trickery and dirty tactics, the questers were able to kill him with Greek Fire. Lucien took the semi-divinity's skull as a trophy. Trophy | 'Skull of a Genius' | ??? | The skull of Genius the Daemonic, the Genius that Lucien was forced to face alone during his mission to save King Hyllus of the Dorians from harm. During the mission Lucien took on the identity of King Iatrokles of Eborikos, but after he was separated from the rest of the army he was forced by the Genius to confront the reality of the situation. Ultimately, the Genius was slain and Lucien managed to take the creature's strange skull as a trophy. Armor | 'Armor of King Iatrokles' | ~3000 | The Dorian Armor granted by King Hyllus to Lucien before the battle against the Mycenean forces lead by Odysseus. It is not magical or special, but due to it coming from the start of the Bronze Age Collapse, it is an oddity that Lucien can't part with. To him, it also serves as a reminder of what he went through and saw during the events of the Cull. *** #Appearance: Faceclaim | Height | Weight | Hair color | Eye color | Body type ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- [This guy!](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/337112343450353664/612824669644652620/image0.png?width=496&height=443) (Desperately needs a replacement, imagine him with short hair for now) | 5' 3” | 145 lbs. | Raven Black | Bright Yellow | Slim/Slightly Athletic *** #Personality: The best way to describe Lucien is he'd be a great lab partner, but a terrible friend. Maybe in an educational setting you might not mind being treated like a dumbass if it will help your grade. Of course, that wouldn't really be the case. Lucien is reserved and seemingly timid in most cases because of caution, but every quiet phrase and small greeting is often filled with malice. He often needs to find people willing to work along with his schemes and he can play nice, but it's rare for him to find someone where he can't find something to be annoyed by. The closest person he's ever really gotten to in the last few years is the very being that raised him outside of some safe haven, and even he couldn't escape the occasional venomous comment or spite. He isn't *all* bad though. Though he wouldn't admit it himself, at least in case of his protector Jaufres, he made a bond that he didn't really want to break. He justified the feeling as him feeling great about having some gullible protector, but when the Hyperborean died, all of Lucien's work was heavily affected- and he still isn't really over it now. So it seems the key to this freak's heart is to be useful long enough that he become attached. When it comes to Lucien's morality, it is a little too flexible. Although he's physically weak enough to not really be considered an immediate threat, he's been able to make other demigods he met throughout his life to protect and die for him, all for the sake of his constant research and experiments. Unlike with Jaufres, Lucien slept easy with those cases, and you can expect that same chilly nature initially. It should also be noted how resentful and envious of a person he really is. Although he will initially always show interest towards those with the capacity to cast magic, he can't stop his strong feelings of envy. All he has is his ability to brew and experiment with potions, and nothing more. This means that he will never really be able to like those that cast magic and can't help him in his personal goal, and that he might never be able to get over his dislike of his mother at all. It would really be good just to not touch the subject of honoring the gods at all with him. While some of his experiences following the Cull have made him more capable of tolerating and appreciating others, the Cull's end also reinforced a lot of his self-importance and personality quirks. *** #History: How Circe met his mortal mother is a story Lucien doesn't know, and a story he doesn't care to find out about. All he knows is that at some point, that brief union occurred, and he was unlikely result. He didn't question it when he lived alone with a single mother, and he only managed to learn of his divine parentage years after his mortal mother had become irrelevant to his thoughts. Besides the circumstances of his birth, there was nothing strange about Lucien's early life. He had a little issue in the first two years of mortal schooling, but that's hardly of note. The moment that his life took a turn for the worst was back when he was back in 2026. He can sometimes recall the most specific details about it, although nowadays he tries to just ignore it. It was late at night, and he was with his dumb teenage neighbor because he was too young to be left alone while his mother worked. He went outside to his backyard to pick flowers for her, and then... well, he never could find his way back. If it wasn't for a wandering Hyperborean giant, Lucien would've died out there. Although Lucien was initially afraid of the creature, his need to survive even as a child made it so he'd have to rely on the being he began to call 'Roi'. The giant's true name was Jaufres, and although he didn't look it, he was far more battle hardened than most of his kind would want to be. It was Jaufres who kept the young boy fed and warm, as well as Jaufres who exposed the boy to the magical world he was living in, all simply by speaking to him in Ancient Greek. Eventually, after perhaps a month of travel, it was Jaufres who brought Lucien to a new home. This place was a war camp more than it was a refuge, sheltering veterans of some never forgotten conflict that had gotten all kinds of creatures. The inhabitants, mostly all demigods, didn't care to take on another mouth to feed, but they did need someone like Jaufres around for protection. That was how Lucien went from having the most caring and loving relationship with his mother to being tossed into the life of a vagrant in a world of gods and monsters. Although Jaufres just meant to keep the boy safe by introducing him to these forgotten men and women, all the Hyperborean would do is seal the boy's fate as the timid yet manipulative apothecary he was when he arrived in Camp Half-Blood. But once Jaufres perished, Lucien was left without a guardian, without protection, and with a lot of spite. It was through his cowardice and need for self-preservation that he made his way to Long Island, until he finally reached the camp where he expected to only stay a week or two and rest. But on one fateful day, a malevolent god saw fit to punish the world for its heresy, and Lucien was stuck with the choice of bowing to the gods or two help Camp fight against them. . Eventually, there even came a point where Lucien was chosen for a seemingly suicidal quest to travel to Mt. Olympus through the Culling of New York, just to save Zeus, a deity Lucien hated like no other. Alongside Yossi and Mina, he fought against the semi-divinity Trisheros, the Mycenaean Equivalent to the gods Hermes and Thoth. The three even met Thetis, the Mother of Achilles, who helped them navigate a flooded NYC to the gates of Olympus. There, the three were forced to split up as his companions fought off Genii and Lucien rushed to find Zeus. Ultimately, it was with the declaration of the alias 'Iatrokles Soter' that the boy struck at Zeus' chains and completed the objective of the quest. Following this act, Lucien was forced to fight alongside Mina against a horde of panicked minor deities and genii until they ultimately received some aid from other demigods. In a group of five, Lucien was among those who convinced the Mycenaean Kronos to send Campers to the past to save Hyllus, the progenitor to Dorian Greece. As first to meet the ancient King, he took on another alias as 'King of Eborikos' which earned him his armor and placed him square in the middle of fighting the Mycenaean forces. It was just his luck that he was dragged out of the battle by Genius the Daemonic, who wished to seduce him into serving the Mycenean cause. Ultimately, Lucien bested his foe, and following the army's victory against Odysseus, Kronos sacrificed his freedom through the breaking of time. To his immense surprise, Lucien woke up with his belongings, square in the middle of the camp he was raised in, surrounded by those he knew to be dead. For weeks he believed he alone was sent as a Prophet to prevent the Cull before it occurred, but ultimately the two months he got with the Remnants proved to only serve as a lesson for the boy. No souls truly escape Hades. Every demigod fated to die still ended up dying, and all Lucien accomplished was trying with futility to at least spare his old friend his original fate. #Present Day: Now, at probably the least appropriate time, Lucien would be forced to return to Camp as he once did before the break of time. In a few ways, the Lucien of this timeline was... better? He didn't arrive at the border of camp with a dirty mess with ratty hair, at least. No, this time he showed up in armor, carrying two satchels, and with an expression that just read 'I freaking hate everything'. While Lucien before the Cull had arrived in camp in denial of his feelings about Jaufres' death, this Lucien arrived much worse. This Lucien had made up with Jaufres, tried to save him, and ultimately failed. After thinking he was a Prophet of the end times sent to save the Chosen of Kronos, he had everything ripped from his grasp. Even now, he told himself he'd come to Camp Half-Blood to save it, but he knew that he came the same reason the other Lucien did. He had nowhere else to go. Carrying his things, the Child of Circe was completely unaware of his terrible timing as he made his way down Half-Blood Hill. He didn't know that the gods he despised were visiting, or even the truth about the Cull not being a threat anymore. He just knew he had to get to someone he knew, and fast. *** #Notes: Lucien is back, and sadder than before! Sadly I was going through a very rough time when I started writing my Remnant storyline, and as a result there were major delays that I simply couldn't ignore due to the urgency of the actual story. As a result I ended up slowly losing my ability to properly tell it, until I no long even felt I could do the story some justice. But I've made the decision to bring back Lucien since I liked the character and wanted to keep using him on the sub I'm now a moderator of rather than only read and respond to modmail like a weirdo. The events I had planned for the Remnant storyline still occurred to this Lucien, some of which are said in this intro. I do intend to go back and explore the Remnant story, but it will have to be through threads and flashbacks. I don't think anyone was that invested in them anyway, so I don't think any of you will mind the tardiness of the storymodes. With that being said, thanks if you read it this far! Also the account flair is weird cause Olympics, Lucien is not an Olympian God sorry.",

756,"My Response to RedarinaThis extremely long post will be my attempt at a comprehensive list of the main reasons why I cannot accept the Redarina theory. These are the plot holes, problems, inconsistencies, and those things that I just can't justify to make it work. I was asked by u/wolfbysilverstream to compile this list some time ago and it's taken me awhile to put it together. I have no interest in really arguing any of these things as I've done it all before. These are only my personal opinions on why I don't believe Redarina was ever intended to be the endgame. TAKOMA PARK AND DIANE FOWLER While at this point in the show we still don't have any answers for what happened to Red's family in the Takoma Park house, what seems clear to me is that this doesn't work at all in the Redarina theory. Red bought the house with the intent to blow it up. He told Luli that he raised his family in that house. Raising a family implies raising a child or children, not living there with parents or siblings. We know that Katarina was officially married to Constantin and had Masha in her KR identity. She lived with them in the Summer Palace. Even if they had another home they traveled to, it wasn't a house in Takoma Park, Maryland. So unless we find out Katarina had another family that she raised in that house, I can't see how this can be explained. Red's scene with Diane Fowler also presents a big problem I've never seen resolved. She says she can tell Red what happened to his family. He says that he wants to know that more than anything, but he will find out another way. If Red is Katarina, where on earth is this other family? Katarina's parents were still alive in 2014. Her ex husband was still alive and Liz was too. Just like the Takoma Park house, the situation with Fowler doesn't fit any narrative we know about Katarina. RED'S MOTHER One problem that pops up for Redarina is in 3.09 when Red tells Aram that he stood over the open grave of his mother. ***""First for my mother, then the others""*** We also Red hear talk about his mother to Liz in the same conversation as he talks about his father who excommunicated him. Red says his father cast him out but his mother understood him. He regrets not teaching Liz to think like her. What stood out to me in the Redarina theory, is that Dom is supposed to be the father who threw him out, but Red goes in and out of his house many times. Yet this understanding mother is never once seen in all those years. Wouldn't Red have gone to his mother for comfort when Liz died if she were alive? We know Katarina's mother was alive in 1991 and she was given a new identity. She was still alive in early 2019, remarried and living near Chicago all that time. We would have to jump through a bunch of hoops to make that work, explaining Red thought she was dead, or he was lying to Aram, or he was talking as RR instead of Katarina. None of that works for me. RECOGNIZING RED AS REDDINGTON We've talked before about all the people who met Red and instantly recognized him as RR. The answer I always get in response is that Koehler was able to create a perfect replica of Reddington. This idea always fell flat to me, because of who those people were and their relationship to RR. People like Admiral Abraham who was Reddinton's roommate and recognized Red immediately after hearing his voice some twenty years later. Or blond Kat who grabbed Red in Paris, believing he was the man who once meant a great deal to her. We always talk about those highlighted moments in the show, where you know the camera focuses on a specific shot to tell the audience it's important. Many of the highlighted moments have come over six seasons with Harold Cooper and his history with Reddington. From the pilot when Cooper says, ""It really is him,"" to their history in Kuwait, the Seaduke incident, speaking of their families, and more recently saving each other's lives. There's too many of those moments for me to discount. Then you have those people who had troubled relationships with Reddington, but also were close to Katarina. I really can't believe that those people have no idea Red is posing as RR, but is really Katarina. That defies any kind of rational explanation for me. Alan Fitch, who worked closely with Katarina in the Cabal, recognized Red as Reddington. Fitch calls him Ray, told Red he always liked him, and seems to have a knowledge of him that extends way before the time of the fire. We find out that Fitch spent the last twenty some years holding the Cabal off, knowing that Red couldn't read the fulcrum, protecting him. Does Fitch really not know Red is supposed to be Katarina given his history with her? Is he really having Katarina beaten and tortured like that in 1.10 believing Red is Katarina? That's very unlikely in my opinion. We met Constantin Rostov who was married to Katarina for a number of years. He recognized Red's voice immediately on the phone as RR after 26 years. Constantin seemed to know Red very well from the past. He talks of Reddington being the man who had an affair with his wife and stole his daughter. He accuses Red of turning him into a dishonest businessman, even putting a gun in Red's mouth at some point. The idea that Constantin doesn't recognize his wife at all in the man in front of him, is not believable to me. DIALOGUE INCONSISTENT WITH REDARINA What stands out to me are the many examples of dialogue that are very inconsistent with the premise of Red being Katarina. I've included a few in the following sections. But these are some that I don’t believe can be reconciled with the theory. In season one, Red says, ""***I want to sleep like I slept when I was a boy.***"" But in season six, when the Redarina clues are coming fast and furious, Red no longer says boy, but child: ""***I was a difficult child.***"" That always seemed to be an obvious change in words to accommodate the theory. In other words, a red herring. In 4.19, Red is alone with Dembe explaining why his actions were responsible for Hans' death: ""***Understand this was 25 years ago now. I was younger, myself. Intent on building an empire, intent on becoming the powerful criminal the world had been told I already was.***"" Red makes no distinction between the man who was labeled a criminal and himself. He is saying *""I""* was intent on becoming the criminal. That *he* is the person who was framed for treason. Another example comes in 5.20 when he is explaining to Jennifer about the Cabal. ""***The Cabal is the one I stumbled across and tried to destroy. To prevent that, they tried to destroy me.***"" Again, he is talking about himself. He is the person who stumbled across the Cabal. He tried to destroy them. They tried to destroy him. That person was RR, it was not Katarina. She was working with the Cabal. This last example doesn't fit at all with Red being Katarina. ""***Dembe didn't stay with me because he saw me as his savior. He stayed with me because he saw me for the man I really was, a man surrounded by darkness. No friends who could be trusted, no faith that loyalty or love could ever truly exist. I was. Well, I was younger then. Angrier.***"" We've seen nothing to this late date in the show where Katarina was betrayed by her friends and family. Where she had any reason to feel that she had no one to support or love her. On the contrary, from everything we've seen, Katarina is the one who betrayed all those close to her, not the other way around. We saw many examples of her friends and family who came to her rescue to support her. Kate, Sam, Dom, Lena, and Ilya. Katarina was flooded with help and the love of others. This dialogue is completely inconsistent with Red being Katarina. PERSONALITIES OF RED AND KATARINA One big obstacle that I always saw with the idea that Red is Katarina came when looking into the personalities of the characters. We've spent a lot of time watching Red in his relationships and interactions with people. What is first noticeable about him is his outgoing, gregarious nature. Red gravitates naturally to people, and forms friendships easily. We see him hug and kiss those he knows, and shows a warm and natural caring side to those he has relationships with. In general terms, I'd describe Red as the life of the party, an extrovert. A person who enjoys getting to know people and hearing their stories. While we've only seen Katarina's personality through other's memories, what becomes apparent right away, is a more reserved, cautious person, an introvert. Her interactions with Kate and even her daughter were standoffish and not overly warm. Kate's last memory of being with Katarina showed her shock when she hugged her goodbye. She didn't seem used to displays of affection by Katarina. It's very difficult for me to imagine the colder, calculating woman we see in the past becoming the warm, personable man today. Life's experiences can change a person, but the extent of the differences in their personalities seems way too great to believe they're the same individual. FINGERPRINTS, BLOOD TYPE AND DNA Any imposter theory needs to account for Red's fingerprints matching Reddington's. We know they would have been on record with the Navy, and there was also a copy of his prints shown from the NYPD dated in 1989. Those would have had to be switched out at some point if Red was not Reddington. Difficult, but not impossible. We know Red's blood type also matches what was in Reddington's Naval records. Again, maybe a little more difficult, but it's Red. Having someone on the inside to change fingerprints and blood type isn't beyond what we could expect from him. My problem with the Redarina theory comes very soon in season one, not with the prints or blood type, but with the DNA profile that would have been done when Red surrendered. We hear in 1.10 that the blood found when Red was tortured by Garrick matched to what they had on file. If the FBI took Red's blood and did a DNA profile, then there's no way at that point he could be genetically female. Even the most basic DNA test will show gender. This problem is further compounded in season six when Red goes to prison. While I could take issue with the strip searches and the unrealistic nature of a sex change that can pass unnoticed, I won't. What cannot be explained is how Red's blood (or any sample) can be taken for a DNA profile once again, and have a profile put into CODIS that doesn't show gender. If Red was Katarina, there's no way to avoid having his DNA show he was born a female. ""***Well, Koehler did a remarkable job of changing your appearance. But we both know that he can't change your DNA.***"" Sorry, but I don't care what kinds of fringe type science we've seen on the show. You cannot biologically change your gender. The idea that Katarina had this sex change almost 30 years ago that can go undetected in numerous strip and body cavity searches is not viable on its own. But to say that he can also fool DNA tests which identify him as a woman is beyond unbelievable. If the writers had ever intended the endgame to be Redarina, they wouldn't have taken a DNA profile of Red in season one. And if they changed paths to Redarina like some want to believe, they wouldn't have made the decision to use the prison storyline in season six, which would inevitably put Red's DNA into CODIS. RED AND NAOMI When I look at any theory, for it to be viable for me, it has to explain the relationship between Red and Naomi. Studying it through the Redarina lens brings up some issues that I can't explain or rationalize. We first are introduced to Naomi's character when Red looks at a picture of her and proceeds to tell Liz, ""***She was my wife.***"" Red uses the words wife or ex wife to describe Naomi six more times after that. Unless we accept that Red is a habitual liar to Liz, there is a reason he referred to Naomi as his wife. There were other ways of writing those lines that give the same meaning, but they chose to have Red call Naomi *my wife* over and over. And quite possessively I might add. From the moment Naomi is taken by Berlin, we see Red's distress. He shows deep seated emotions at seeing her finger and tooth sent to him. When Red and Dembe risk their lives to rescue Naomi, he shows more emotions when he gets her back. Over almost seven seasons, we've seen Red this distraught and worried over the welfare and safety of very few people: Liz, Naomi, Dembe, Dom and Ilya. Watching Red and Naomi's interactions showed me a long, complicated relationship between two people who still have a great deal of love for one another. Their emotional and tender goodbye was probably one of the few scenes where Red shows a true romantic love for a woman. Trying to put these actions and scenes into a Redarina perspective feels completely wrong to me. There is also no indication Carla and Katarina ever spent time together or had any kind of relationship before the fire, much less the kind that would be needed to see these types of feelings. DEMBE AND SUTTON ROSS The story of Sutton Ross and the bag of bones presents a yet unexplained issue for those in the Redarina camp. If Red is Katarina, and the bones were identified as Reddington's, we have a big problem. From what we've been told about Ross, he was active in the 80's stealing R&D for companies and countries. He was given a new identity by Garvey instead of arresting him. From Ross' own words, we know he had been waiting 30 years to get his revenge on Reddington for selling him plans for a plane that couldn't fly. This puts the date for the sale of the dodo bird in the late 1980's, we'll before the fire and RR's disappearance. While on the hunt for Ross and the bag of bones, we have this conversation between Red and Dembe. It's not until I really looked at what Dembe is saying this time, did I notice what he's really implying: ***""The truth always comes out.""*** *""It better, or we're not gonna find Sutton Ross.""* ***""I'm talking about your truth. It was bound to surface. Ross wants blood. He thinks you ruined his life.""*** *""I didn't give Sutton Ross bogus plans for the Grayscape Seventeen.""* ***""But he thinks you did, and because of that, he wants the world to know what's inside the duffel.""*** So the way most people seem to interpret this, is that we're supposed to assume that RR sold Ross some bogus plans that destroyed his life. And now his revenge is to tell the world that this guy isn't RR. Except...if Ross knows Red isn't RR, then he isn't the man who sold him the bogus plans. So why does he want revenge for something he would know Red didn't do if the bag of bones identified as Raymond Reddington? Dembe is Red's secret keeper, the guy who knows exactly who Red is, and knows who's in the duffle bag. Dembe is saying that Red's truth is going to come out because Ross is going to get his revenge on Red. *""Ross wants blood. He thinks* ***you (Red)*** *ruined his life.""* Dembe is telling Red and the audience that Ross believes Red is the Raymond Reddington who sold him the plans for the dodo bird. Red says he's not the guy who sold him the plans, so that has to mean he's not RR, right? But look at what Dembe says again: *""But he thinks* ***you (Red)*** *did, and because of that, he wants the world to know what's inside the duffel.""* If we take the sentence and break up what Dembe says, 1) he is telling Red that Ross believes he is the man (RR) who sold him the plans. 2) So to get his revenge on Reddington (Red) for selling him bogus plans, Ross is going to expose the truth of who's in the bag (which cannot be RR). Reddington can't be both the man Ross believes screwed him over that he's getting his revenge on, and the man dead in the bag. If Dembe knew the real RR was dead in that bag, and he knew Ross had a DNA report stating that the bones belonged to RR, he wouldn't believe Ross still thought that Red is the Reddington who sold him the plans. This seems to me to be a direct hit at the Redarina theory. If Dembe is the man who is Red's secret keeper, if he knows Red is Katarina and the bones were identified as RR, he wouldn't be telling Red that Ross believes he's Reddington. KATE People who are proponents of the Redarina theory have to decide whether Kate believed Red was Katarina, or if she never knew. When I looked at the theory seriously, what became noticeable to me was that there were clues that most people used as proof that Kate knew Red was Katarina. But, there were also clues that pointed away from Kate believing Red was her. I find that Kate is probably one of the bigger problems I see with Redarina, and I'll explain why. Here are the main clues that are used to show the audience that Kate believed Red is Katarina: *""Do you remember what I looked like that night? Lying in the street, my head torn open, Annie's body in front of me.""* ""***You know I don't know what you looked like. I was away.***"" ***""...just like you asked me to all those years ago, when you first put her in my arms as a baby girl..""*** ***""I've been his cleaner, keeper, and confessor for 30 years…""*** These statements by Kate show that she believed she has been working for Red since Liz was a baby. While the easiest jump to make is that must mean Red is Katarina, it's also equally plausible that Red hired Kate in a similar way as when he hired Tom. He told her after he hired her in 1997 that he was the man who sent her to Katarina and Masha. In this scenario, Kate has been working for Red since Liz was a baby as he sent her there as a nanny. As far as I'm aware, these are the *only* clues that point to Kate believing Red is Katarina. But there are also other clues that point directly against that idea. When Red met Kate around 1997, she believed he was Raymond Reddington, the traitor who abandoned his family to become a criminal. She believed he was the Raymond that had an affair with Katarina, and was responsible for tearing her little family apart. Nothing I've seen since that point leads me to believe that she ever knew he was anyone but that Raymond. What follows are some of my reasons. In 4.18, Kate is trying to get Liz to separate herself and her daughter from Red. Kate says: ""**Please, do what your mother never had the courage to do until it was too late. Walk away from Raymond.**"" Kate believed that Katarina couldn't walk away from her affair with Raymond and that is what led to Masha's kidnapping and eventually Katarina's suicide. So Kate is trying to keep Liz from making the same mistake and wants her to walk away from Raymond before it's too late and her life is also destroyed. Kate makes no distinction between the Raymond that Katarina couldn't walk away from and the Raymond she wants Liz to walk away from. In my opinion, it's clear that she believes Red is Raymond Reddington just like she did when he hired her in 1997. Trying to explain this by saying that Kate knows Katarina became Raymond, and that's why she never walked away from him, so she wants Liz to walk away from Raymond who is her mother...just no. Another hotly contested clue comes when Kate tells Red that he will find his wife twice in 2.02. While many want to argue that Kate was only keeping to a role that Carla was Reddington's wife, that falls flat for me. There were other ways to write the lines, and combined with what Red says about *his wife* multiple times, and his reactions to losing her, it's a mark on the side of Kate believing Red is RR. There are many less argued problems I have with Kate knowing that Red is Katarina, even if they are just as or more convincing to me. Kate preserved 86 bodies with manner of death, identities and physical markings to use against Red at a later date. Including Hans who was buried in 1992 and who she moved. ""***I gave Agent Gale the bodies. I can give you locations and dates that the bodies were collected and buried.***"" You don't keep evidence to use against the person you love like family and then tell them: ***""I'm gonna do what I should've done years ago. I took a bullet to my head, but I remember what my father taught me. Our stories are written in flesh. And I'm gonna use that lesson to render you powerless.""*** Kate said she should have done this *years ago.* This was premeditated, supposedly against Katarina? Kate faked Liz's death to get her away from her mother? We're supposed to believe Kate was only saving Liz and Agnes. But she used a plane belonging to Red's associate, with his money and sent Tom to Cuba before the threat to Liz was over. She set Tom up to get killed by Red. Then she had to know Red would either kill himself or commit suicide by cop after Liz's faked death. Those things were also premeditated with forethought to hurt Red both mentally and physically. Kate seemed to have the misguided belief that she had at least equal or more right as Liz's nanny to protect Liz. I cannot see how Kate would know that Red is Katarina and do what she did to destroy Liz's mother. Not only did she actively try to separate Liz from Red by faking her death, Kate has the nerve to tell him that he needed to let her go. Kate's actions don't ring true to the idea that she knew Red was Liz's parent. Nothing we see backs up the premise that Kate felt he had the right as parent to make decisions for his daughter. You can compare Kate's attitude towards Red which is completely opposite to how we know Dom sees Red as Liz's true parent and defers to him to make all the decisions in her life. Another point on Kate involves the apology to Katarina before she dug up the suitcase. One of Kate's last acts, after trying to completely destroy Red--faking Liz's death, making him despondent and contemple suicide, dismantling his criminal empire, and trying to kill him by poisoning him, was to give Liz some truth to separate her from Red. So after everything Kate went through to destroy Red, if she believes he is Katarina, what is the point of Kate apologizing to her? So we're supposed to believe in the Redarina theory that Kate has spent the last 20 years planning (or at least being ready) to take down Katarina, makes good on that plan with 86 bodies, fakes Liz's death, destroys her business, poisons her, and yet Kate then feels the need to apologize before digging up the suitcase? That is yet one more issue with Kate knowing that requires too much suspension of common sense. Right before Kate jumps to her death she once again shows premeditation in trying to destroy Red by telling him she dug up the suitcase, and having Tom be the delivery agent of it to Liz. Just like what she did after faking Liz's death, she has once again set Red and Tom on a collision course to kill each other. But then Kate says to Red, ""***I made a promise to Elizabeth's mother to protect her girl at all costs.***"" So she's planning to destroy Liz's mother once again, while first apologizing to Katarina and then trying to fulfill her promise to Katarina? The only way to justify the Redarina theory for me with Kate's actions and words, is if she never knew he was Katarina. Then this throws out the only clues for the theory. What becomes clear to me after considering *all the clues* is that Kate always believed Red was Reddington. I've seen nothing else onscreen that contradicts that. DOM The relationship with Dom and Red is often one of the main points that proponents of Redarina talk about in support of the theory. That and the conversations we've heard between them. If you only look on the surface, a case could be made that their troubled relationship comes from Dom's inability to accept his daughter's change into the man he sees before him. But when I look below the surface, the problems I see become one of the biggest reasons I can't accept it. We first met Dom towards the end of season three after Red goes to tell him that his granddaughter had died in childbirth. Dom seems bitter and angry, and blames Red for all that's wrong in his world. We see that while Dom and Red have an uneasy, troubled relationship, they obviously know each other well. We're supposed to think that this could be Red's father, but as I listened to what was said, I got a strong sense this was Red's father in law. Dom lets him in his home, allows him to stay, and cooks for him, but he's generally indignant and resentful towards Red. Like he's stuck putting up with his presence, even if he's a lonely old man with no one to talk to. On subsequent rewatches, even looking at that episode through a Redarina lens, I just can't see how Dom's words fit if he's knowingly speaking to his daughter. I can't imagine Dom not only denying Katarina one ounce of comfort over her daughter's death, but then also blaming her for it. *""These boxes are all I have all I have left of my daughter.""* *""I'm sorry, Dom. I understand.""* ***""No, you don't. You don't understand. You think because Masha's dead, now you, you can understand me? You can, you can share my misery?""*** *""I feel bereft, just like you.""* ***""No, not just like me. She's gone because of choices you made for both of them. First Katarina and then Masha. As far as I'm concerned, you killed my entire family!""*** So I'm supposed to believe that Katarina comes to her father after Masha dies. He won't comfort her, yells at her for wearing his coat, and for going through her own things? Then Dom blames Katarina for her own daughter's death, telling her she's responsible for killing his whole family (including herself apparently), and calls her a selfish prick because she wanted to have a relationship with her daughter? That's a bit hard to accept for me. What also makes no sense is what Red says about the glitter. ""***I was just imagining young Katarina covered in glitter.***"" This would be just the beginning of many examples of Red speaking about himself in the third person if he was Katarina. And he wouldn't need to imagine himself covered in glitter if he used to play with it. He would be *remembering* playing with it. Then you also have to include the scene with the buttermilk. If Red was Katarina, at some point in his 50+ years, he would have had buttermilk before with Dom. If Dom drank it growing up and had it in the house, Katarina would be very familiar with the drink. She was probably used to drinking it, not surprised by it. This episode never gave me a feeling at any point that Dom was speaking to Katarina. We meet Dom the next time when Red is under attack by Kate. That's when we find out that he keeps his plan of last resort buried in Dom's garage. Again, it would be easy to assume that this must be Red's father because he trusts Dom with something so important. But then Red tells Dom, ***""You don’t have to believe me or help me or like me. You never have. I don’t know why you’d have to start now.""*** This comment also never fit if Red is Katarina. Why would Dom be so devastated at the loss of his daughter that he had to crawl into the woods like a mortally wounded animal to run out the clock and die, and keep his daughter's childhood toys? But Red says Dom never believed or helped him, or ever liked him? How do you explain the events of Rassvet or Orion if Dom never helped his daughter? That doesn't fit unless we somehow twist ourselves up into knots. Where I believe Redarina comes grinding to a halt with respect to Dom is in seasons six and seven. While proponents of the theory think these conversations cement it for them, I find it does the direct opposite. In the moments before Red is scheduled to be executed, he talks to Liz about the fractured relationship with his father and about who he was before. This is what he says: ""***I was a difficult child. People saw me one way, I saw myself another. I felt misunderstood, acted out. My father fancied himself a disciplinarian. Very moralistic. Instead of trying to understand me, he excommunicated me.***"" Red's description of his moralistic father who excommunicated him, isn't consistent at all with what we see when we get to Dom's account of Rassvet. Even if I believe little of it, nothing suggests that Dom excommunicated Katarina. Red tells Liz that he was a difficult *child* and his father cast him out. So this implies that Red was excommunicated by his father as a young man, before adulthood. This doesn't fit with later scenes of Dom and Ilya working with Katarina up until and even after she staged the suicide. Where is Dom disciplining Katarina in this situation? What Red says about acting out and being disciplined by his father is what one says about being a kid in their parent's home. Not a 30 year old woman who decided to turn into a man. Then we also need to account for the fact that Red certainly doesn't seem to be cut off from Dom or excommunicated in any way. His escape plan was in Dom's garage and it must have been there for quite some time. Dom calls Red up on the phone to tell him Liz showed up at his house. Red feels comfortable just showing up at his door and staying for days. Dom lets him in and cooks for him. This would be the strangest example I've ever seen of a parent throwing a child out, as Katarina was about 30 when she would have had the Koehler surgery. And Red's had that island box with Dom for a long time, so was it a 5 or 10 year excommunication? This doesn't really make sense at all in my opinion. Then the visit by Red to Dom in 6.18 becomes even more problematic with Redarina. We are supposed to believe Dom excommunicated his daughter and can't accept who she is now, but what they say here doesn't fit. In fact we heard Dom say himself that he forgave his daughter even after she betrayed him. ***""My child betrayed everything I believed in. She turned her back on my country and on me. And because she was a traitor, people assumed that I was one, as well. What did I do, I turn her in, turn my back on her the way she turned her back on me? No, no. I went into hiding, gave up my home, my granddaughter. Masha doesn't even know I exist.""*** *""You forgave Katarina. But not me.""* ***""I forgave my child.""*** Dom is talking about giving up his entire life, cutting himself off from all of his family and living alone to keep them safe. He did it because he loved them. He forgave what Katarina did in betraying him because he loved her. And he forgave her part in whatever happened in the past to cause him to give everyone up. But since Red was not his child, he didn't forgive him. If Dom said he forgave his daughter, and his daughter is Raymond, then how does he not forgive Raymond who actually is his daughter? This again requires some extreme contortions to make work. What becomes even more untenable for Redarina is Red's description of his father as moralistic when we get to Ilya's memories in Orion. There's no way Red would ever describe his father as being moralistic after knowing what Dom did to try and murder blond Kat. Then the conversation between Dom and Ilya about telling Reddington anything about what they did in Belgrade becomes bizarre. ""*I should tell him.*"" ""***We're not telling him anything.***"" ""*Oh. I know how you feel, but Reddington deserves to know what we've done.*"" ""***Why? Why does Reddington deserve to know anything***"" ""*Because he's a part of this.*"" So Katarina's father isn't going to tell his daughter what they did to protect Masha, because she became Reddington? Even if it made the entire situation worse for Katarina and Masha? I'm not seeing how this works either. While the idea of Redarina with Red and Dom's relationship may seem clear to some on the surface, it really makes little sense when you look a little closer. CONCLUSION I could probably add many more little things that don't fit if Red is Katarina, but I'll leave it there. The writers have done a great job constructing a narrative that leaves a trail of obvious clues that make it seem like Redarina has to be the endgame. But like I've said before, the clues are too glaring and too obvious for me to believe them. When you really start looking under the surface of many of the previous and most current clues we've been given, there becomes too many problems for me to believe the writers ever intended Redarina to be the solution to this mystery.",
757,"2 months post 1st MDMA - session. I think my process arrived at my core trauma: severe emotional neglect. And I'm having a great time comforting my abandoned, lonely, hurting inner childIt all started when my mom single handedly decided to move the family to the area she grew up in in an attempt to relief her severe depression shes been having for a while. My extremely irresponsible father had no objections, knowing she was being suicidal and extremely abusive. It was not the constant physical abuse, the constant berating, demeanor by my severely depressed and suicidal mom, not the worrying about coming home from my horrible, horrible school and her being gone, having killed herself because I am such a burden, it was not the disgust and hopeless despair I felt when my weak, useless joke of a father coming to us kids for comfort because mom was so mean to him when he came on weekends, instead of comforting the SHIT out of us and admitting her to a mental hospital. It wasn't being my new, horrible teachers scapegoat and nemesis, because i was a LOT smarter than anyone else, correcting false information she gave the class with the purest, good intention, and the two years of being the victim to the bullying bonanza of a 60 year olt frustrated teacher and ""her"" students, which I was never given a chance to be a part of. The worst part of it all by far was that i was so incredibly lonely and abandoned. I had no friend, no ally, no shoulder to cry on, no one to give me warmth and telling me it is going to be ok. Every one around me was either hating me or in emotional pain and closed off themselves. I spend 4 years without a single incident of affection. I was the playing ball in a cruel game of ""which parent is more despicable than the other"", those two played with us poor kids whenever my father WAS here, hitting, spitting and berating each other, seeking my reaffirmation that indeed the other one was the horrible one. All i could think was ""are you fucking serious, what about ME?!?!?!"" I remember my suicidal fantasies, ""maybe THEN they finally see me!"", my inner conflict wanting to call the police on my mom to protect me from her when she hit me over and over again and then setting up her false face when the phone rang and my deep empathy for her and my desire to protect her despite everything she constantly did to me. I didn't remember any of this cleary prior to my MDMA - experience. Not even psilocybin mushrooms took me there. MDMA finally did. And then all dams broke. Thanks to MDMA, this inner child is finally entrusting itself to it's adult self, me, today and alive!Yesterday i dreamed seeing a documentary film I was featured in. When I watched the scenes with me in them i felt so proud, so protected and thinking to myself, this is a really sweet dude. He's pretty cool, i like him. This emotion is completely new to me and I am enjoying it so much! After 2 months of trauma processing, finally arrived at this relationship-building process with my inner child, myself, is so beautiful and rewarding. As another user here recently put it, the needyness is dying! I wish i could sit all day rocking, gently stroking, comforting and loving my inner child, griefing what never was for us, in this newly discovered togetherness, wholeness. I am really enjoying this self-nurturing, self-parenting. I always loved to give love, it simply never occured to me that I can give it to myself aswell. I am finally healing. MDMA therapy might be hard, but for me it is the real turning point. From now on my life will get better. The planet might be dying but thanks to this medicine I can feel like I can fulfill my lifelong dream of benefiting humanity and help it evolve further. Give LOVE to the world. I have such a big heart, closing it off any longer really doens't seem to make any sense right now. I love you, fellow survivors! I hope I can one day find the compassion to forgive my parents for the horrible job they did. It felt like they were actively trying to ruin my life so severly that I will never be able to feel like a real person.",
758,"A rant on ovulation, abstinence is unnatural, killing, & women being the gatekeepers to life.I would argue that life begins at ovulation. Why? Because gametes that are contained within the ovaries are actually *not* alive. They are inactive. It is during the ovulation process, that they are imbued with mitochondria. Mitochondria are what carry out metabolism in a cell. Metabolism is what makes something alive. So you have this cell, that literally will die without the necessary ''nutrients,'' that is a sperm. Denying an egg sperm would be like denying a zef access to your womb. Yet an egg is not entitled to sperm. To demand sperm be provided to it would be to violate the man whose sperm you are demanding. Likewise, to demand a uterus be provided to a zef would be to violate the woman whose uterus you are demanding. So the truth is, gametes are alive and are necessary building blocks for all human beings. You literally cannot have a human being without gametes. *They are just as important as a fertilized egg.* It seems pretty arbitrary to not count them as also being alive and worthy of not being ''arbitrarily'' killed as prolifers often like to vocalize when it comes to fertilized eggs. They are arbitrarily applying more worth to a fertilized egg than they are to the egg prior to conception. They gripe at us, thinking that we arbitrarily applying more worth to a born human than an unborn one. (We do, but how worthy of life something is has nothing to do with our argument that women own their bodies at all times and are therefore deserving of controlling their bodies at all times.) So I am griping about their arbitrary cut off of when something is ''alive'' enough to be considered worthy of protection. It is hypocritical to tell us to remain abstinent and in that same breath tell us that we mustn't interfere with the natural process that is pregnancy. Telling us to remain abstinent is interfering with a natural process. If you are sexually aroused and dont act on it, your choice to interfere with that natural attraction is interfering with nature and denying a future person their life. I can anticipate their objection and that it would be that there is a difference between not allowing to come into existence and actively killing. So its killing they have an issue with? Cause they kill all the time. They kill bacteria, plants, animals, insects all the time. So its killing human life they have an issue with? Cause I doubt they will have an issue with that when they feel threatened themselves. Yet somehow, our feeling threatened isnt justification enough. Or is it innocent life they have an issue with killing? Because I can think of several instances where they would see no issue with someone killing an innocent person. Such as a person with Downs Syndrome trying to rape someone. A child strapped up with bombs headed towards an army base or a town, being sacrificed as a suicide bomber. *Or better yet, innocent women and young girls, who are forced to carry pregnancies to term and die doing so.* Cause yes, this is still killing. Their abortion bans would actively kill innocent women who otherwise had an option that could have left them alive. But they dont care about those pesky details. I could see arguments for it being active killing and passive killing, but to me, it is active killing. Because abortion bans will have placed a paper road block *actively* barring them access to the abortion procedure. And last I checked, causing the death of another person by indirect action or indirect intent is called manslaughter. And they have no right to be doing this to us. Even if we consider a zef as on equal moral ground as born humans, which I dont, we still would completely have the right to kill them. Because they are unwelcome guests using our bodies against our will. They just cant get over the fact that womens bodily processes control life. We hold this immense power. It is our **right** that *we are born with*. They dont like it? Tough. Our bodies control life. We control life. Third party bystanders have no stake to claim in an individuals power over her own bodys function. They throw the 'natural' card around a lot. Well my dear friends, a 3rd party dictating the bodily processes of another human being, *is certainly not natural.*",
759,"""Masha, I can show you the truth. If you want to know why he came into your life."" What was the truth Kate believed she was giving Liz?If we focus on the characters' points of view at the end of 5.22 like we did in my last post, Liz and much of the audience believes the bones were identified as her father's. Even though there should be no possible way for that to occur with what we were told about RR's DNA, that seems to be the prevailing belief. From the other character's POV, that identification is less certain, even a little shaky when viewed from a couple of them. As we've looked at those other characters--Tom, Garvey and Ross, there's no real evidence that they believed those were the bones of Raymond Reddington. What we have is a lot of ambiguous dialogue that could lead us to think they are, but there are also some problems with that too. What about the POV of Kate? We spend a lot of time talking about what she did or didn't know. Who did Kate believe was in the suitcase? Those bones were reburied sometime after Kate was hired by Red circa 1997. If we look at where they were buried and unearthed again in 2017, what does that say about who's in the suitcase? What we do know is that Kate loved Katarina and Masha more than probably anyone, and Agnes once she was born. When she met Red in 1997, she believed he was RR and hated the man: ""***Raymond Reddington. That man set off a chain reaction that took everything I loved from me. And not just me. He turned his back on his family, his country. And for what? A life of crime? He's a traitor. I have nothing to say to him, and I don't wanna hear anything he has to say to me.***"" So if Kate hated Reddington for taking away everything she loved, and she knew the bones belonged to RR, then why did she treat them with such love and reverence? Why was that person buried in a suitcase much like the one we see Katarina pack Masha's clothes in and the one in Dom's garage? Why bury them underneath the apple tree that's marked with a ""K?"" When Kate dug up that suitcase, she apologized to Katarina and lovingly caressed the K on the tree. If those were the bones of a man she despised, would she have cared so much? When Kate went to meet Red around 1997, she believed he was Raymond Reddington. That's obvious in how she speaks to Sam. Many people believe at some point that Kate found out Red was not the man who destroyed her life. But why do they think that's true? Is it *only* because of what we learn through Liz's POV in the 5.22 finale? ***Without the DNA report shown to Liz by Jennifer, what is the basis of belief that Kate thinks Red is a fake?*** What evidence do we have that points to the idea that Kate believed Red is RR? One contested piece of dialogue comes from early in season two when Kate calls Naomi Red's wife. Considering Red also told Liz and some other characters that Naomi was the woman who was his wife many times, it looks like a point on the board for Kate believing Red is that man who was married to that woman. Another conversation between Kate and Liz in 4.18 seems to be evidence for Red being RR: ""***Please, do what your mother never had the courage to do until it was too late. Walk away from Raymond.***"" Kate is telling Liz that her mother never had the courage to walk away from Raymond. In 2017, she still seems to believe that Raymond is the man who had an affair with Katarina and her refusal to end it is what destroyed her and caused her suicide. She is imploring Liz to walk away from Red, even if her mother never could. She believes Red is the man called Raymond, the American she saw in the car with Katarina, and the man who took Masha from the Summer Palace. The man who destroyed her little family. But both of these points for are contested depending on your individual interpretation. So where is the evidence that Kate knew Red was not that Raymond Reddington who was having an affair with Katarina and took Masha from the Summer Palace? The main points I usually hear brought up stem from Kate telling Red that he put Liz into her arms as a baby girl, and the comment he makes about being away when she and Annie were shot. These two points are the basis for the belief that Kate has been working for Red since 1987, and since Kate was hired by Katarina, that means Red is Katarina. Now that to me isn't clear evidence that Kate believed Red wasn't Reddington. It's also equally plausible that Red hired Kate as Liz's nanny anonymously through a service like he hired Tom. To watch over her in another man's home while Katarina was off doing spy stuff. This can also answer the question of 30 years vs 20 years, as well as the other points of Red being her employer from the time Liz was a baby. Red would have told Kate later that he was the man who hired her. Remember when he met her around 1997 he told her: ""***We shared the affection of Katarina. We have a common bond in Elizabeth. I presume your love for the child abides. After Katarina's sudden departure, I felt a responsibility to watch over the girl from a distance...I've provided for her and Sam financially...God willing, Katarina's daughter will live a private life of quiet courage. But if anyone learns her identity, the only way I can stop the threats from rising is to rise up as a greater threat than all of them. Help me protect the girl we love.***"" Red tells Kate when he hired her in 1997 that he's watching over Elizabeth because he cared for Katarina and a responsibility to protect her daughter. Not because he was a parent to her. So if he told her after he hired her that he was also her anonymous employer ten years before, that also fits those clues. Looking at what people refer to *evidence* that Kate knew or didn't know Red was that Raymond involved with Katarina in the past, it seems clear that there is much debate on both sides. So without Liz seeing a DNA report stating that RR was dead, I'm not sure there's any clear, uncontested evidence Kate knew Red wasn't Raymond Reddington. Who did Kate believe was in the suitcase and what was she trying to tell Liz by getting it to her? If we can figure out what she knew and what her intentions were in digging up the bones, maybe we can understand what truth she wanted Liz to know. So let's look at what we do know from Kate's POV about what she thought of Red being in Liz's life. Since this all seems to be centered around Kate wanting him out of it. From Requiem, we saw the moments before Red surrendered to the FBI. Kate was begging him to change his mind. ""***You can't just stroll into her life after all these years. This is a mistake...Raymond, stop. The instant you walk through that door, the damage will be done. You'll destroy her innocence, everything we've been fighting to be preserve. You'll never undo it.***"" Kate seemed to have no problem working for Red, protecting Liz from a distance. But here we see that she clearly didn't want Red to enter her life. Kate doesn't want Liz to have her innocence destroyed by Red's presence, by knowing who she is, or the events of the past. After his surrender and all the danger that entered Liz's life, Kate tried to pry her out of Red's grip. First by faking Liz's death and then by taking Red down. If you believe that Kate was the person who hired Krilov for the second memory manipulation, then that would have been her first attempt to get Liz away from him. Kate begs Liz to separate herself from Red. ""***The reason I'm telling you this now is so that you'll listen to me when I beg you walk away. I gave the authorities enough to put him away forever. But you and your team must disavow any knowledge of the task force.***"" Kate wanted Liz to walk away, and wanted Red out of Liz's life. When faking Liz's death failed, she dug up 86 bodies and tried to put him in prison. But as we know that didn't work either, and Kate's last plan involved digging up the suitcase. Kate meets Liz alone and she tells her: ""*Masha, I can show you the truth*. ***If you want to know why he came into your life.***"" This comment doesn't seem to be discussed very much. We talk a lot about what she is saying about the truth. But what does Kate mean when she says ""why he came into your life""? We can guess why Red entered Liz's life depending on who you believe he is to her. But what does Kate know from her POV? The only two conversations we have to look at on this subject are in Requiem. First, when Red hires Kate, he tells her: ""***After Katarina's sudden departure, I felt a responsibility to watch over the girl from a distance...the only way I can stop the threats from rising is to rise up as a greater threat than all of them. Help me protect the girl we love.***"" Here in 1997, Red is telling Kate that because Katarina had to leave Masha with Sam and disappear, he is stepping in to protect Liz from those threats that come from who her mother was and her work as a spy. Those enemies who are still hunting for Katarina Rostova. Then in 2013, Red is surrendering to the FBI and tells Kate something very similar: ""***As I feared would happen, elements from Katarina's past are circling Elizabeth like a pack of wolves in the night...Indeed, I need to control the danger to Elizabeth. I've built a vast criminal network predicated on that very principal. It's time to live up to my mission statement.***"" So from Kate's POV, based on what Red's told her, he has become part of Liz's life to protect her from her mother's enemies. Those people who are a danger to Masha because they are still hunting for Katarina Rostova. He's built a criminal empire will the sole purpose of rising up as a bigger threat to the enemies of Katarina to protect her daughter. The last conversation we have between Red and Kate comes right before she jumps to her death. ""*You're so focused on destroying me, you're willing to hurt one of the few people you've ever loved.*"" ""***You're right. I was so focused on you, I didn't see that getting you away from her is unnecessary. All I have to do is give her the truth.***"" ""*I don't know what that means.*"" ""***Our secret. At Tansi Farms.***"" ""*What have you done?*"" ""***I have it, Raymond. I went there and I dug it up, and I'm gonna give it to her.***"" Kate told Red at the end that everything she had done to separate Liz from him was pointless. She wants to give Liz the truth. So what was this truth, the fact that Liz's father was dead? That's the assumption that most people are making based on the DNA report Liz saw--that Kate wants Liz to know that her father is dead. Does that make sense looking back, that the truth of why Red came into Liz's life is because her father, RR is dead? From Kate's POV, doesn't she already know that Liz believes her father died in the fire in 1990 and that she shot him? How does Kate believe giving Liz the bones of the father she shot give her the truth? At this point, Liz doesn't even know who her father was, just that he's dead. Would learning that Red isn't the original RR separate Liz from him, or answer why he needed to be in her life? She would still need protection from her mother's enemies, since that's where the danger is coming from. And if Kate knows Red is Katarina like some people believe, giving Liz the bones of her father doesn't do anything to help Liz be safer. Red being Katarina means that the very person who is the most dangerous to Liz and Agnes is the one closest to them. I'm not sure how this keeps Liz or Agnes safe. The bones of RR doesn't give Liz much of a truth at all in this case. Another equally plausible scenario is that Kate believed those bones in the suitcase belonged to Katarina. So what truth would Kate be trying to give Liz if she believed those bones were the remains of her mother? Does this fit with understanding why Red came into Liz's life? He told Kate that he wanted to hire her to protect Liz from her mother's enemies. He told her that he needed to enter Liz's life because Katarina's enemies were circling her daughter like wolves. Was Kate giving Liz the truth that her mother is dead so that there was no more danger to her from those enemies of KR? Wasn't that the whole point of Red entering and staying in Liz's life--the danger to Liz because of who she is? ""***That poor girl, so afraid. Always looking over her shoulder, in the dark about who she was and why it mattered.***"" Why would Kate think Red was so carefully guarding their secret that Katarina was buried in the suitcase? Why wouldn't he want to tell Liz that truth from Kate's POV? I think it comes down to the fact that Kate believed Red so desperately wanted to be part of Liz's life, like she tells the man in the woods: ""***He placed a lovely young woman and her baby girl in terrible danger not deliberately, mind you. He loves them deeply. Enough to blind him to the reality that his very presence in their lives constitutes a threat.***"" So much so, that he is trying to justify his presence in her and Agnes' life by using the excuse of the danger from her mother's enemies. So in Kate's mind, his excuse of protecting them from the dangers surrounding Katarina is bringing only more danger from his own enemies. She believes this is about Red own selfish need to be near Liz, not to keep her safe. If Kate was giving Liz the truth about Katarina being dead, then not only does she believe she is removing the danger to Liz from those hunting for her mother, she also believes it eliminates the need for Red's continued presence in her life. Liz and Agnes could live their lives without the danger from Katarina or from Reddington's enemies. From Kate's POV, her belief that Katarina was buried in the suitcase would explain why giving Liz the truth would protect her long after she was gone. And would also serve to take away any need for Red to be part of Liz's or Agnes' life. When looked at it from Kate's perspective, the idea that she believed Katarina was buried in the suitcase is equally or more plausible than her belief that Raymond Reddington was buried there.",
760,"Album of the Year 2019 #20: Clairo - ImmunityHello everyone and welcome back to another day of Album of the Year 2019, the yearly write-up series by the users of r/indieheads on their favorite albums of the year. Up today, /u/Whatsanillinois provides us an extremely touching look at Clairo's long-anticipated debut, *Immunity*. **Artist:** [**Clairo**](https://cdn3.pitchfork.com/longform/930/clairoheader.jpg) **Album:** [***Immunity***](https://e.snmc.io/i/fullres/w/8bf3542f824a5b4fcf8480980c5d7d49/7539969) &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/3um624qr5v541.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3a4bdfd9502b26892c7fdaef31f1b89e21ba0ab1 **Listen:** [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9l8zCOwEII) [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/4kkVGtCqE2NiAKosri9Rnd?si=DGiMt_NjQCCS5fbOZpZYGw) [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/immunity/1465125166) **Background** Claire Cottrill, better known as Clairo, is a pop artist from the small town of Carlisle, Massachusetts. She began performing music and playing guitar at the age of 13, recording cover songs to post on YouTube and SoundCloud. In her spare time, she would make DJ mixes and release them under the moniker DJ Baby Benz. In 2017, Clairo dropped her single “Pretty Girl” which became an overnight success. The popularity of “Pretty Girl” allowed Clairo to sign a record deal with FADER to release her EP *diary 001* in the summer of 2018, featuring simplistic but immensely enjoyable synthpop songs. And if you’ve never heard her music before, you probably know Clairo because she is most peoples go-to example of the term ‘industry plant’. Take of that as you will. With the release of her latest album *Immunity*, Clairo leaves behind the synthpop aesthetic, instead opting for live instrumentation with a more guitar-oriented sound. With this new record comes a raw and authentic sound accompanied by unrelentingly honest lyricism, creating some of Clairo’s catchiest and most intimate songs yet. **Review** by /u/whatsanillinois **Content warning: depression, suicide.** # Only thirty minutes from Alewife In eighth-grade, I decided that I didn’t want to live anymore. Life was painful and every day felt harder than the last. I was sad and I had no idea why. I would go to school, be with friends and genuinely enjoy my time with them, but still feel crushed by the overwhelming grief of being alive. It’s hard to believe that life is going to get better when your very existence feels like it’s fighting against you. Even though there were things that brought me joy in life, the grief always won. Things I once enjoyed such as playing video games or reading became less of something to enjoy, and more of something to help me escape. Eventually, I hit my tipping point. I was sitting in class just like any other day, and I broke. The stresses of life got the best of me, and all the repressed pain that I was feeling came out. Despite the debilitating depression and anxiety that I constantly faced, I never had an anxiety attack in my life. To put it lightly, it was both the most physically and emotionally painful experience of my life, and it was only made worse by the fact that my peers were watching me and could’ve been thinking that I was weak. I was mortified that they were silently judging me. I got sent to the guidance counsellor’s office where I just sat and cried for what felt like hours. I was defeated. I was broken. My parents came to pick me up. My mother wept and signed me up for therapy. Since that day I’ve never discussed my depression with a family member and very rarely do I open up about it to friends. It was treated as something that both began and ended on that day. I’m doing better now, but for almost as long as I can remember, sadness has been a constant. I’m happy a lot of the time now, but therapy and an emotional breakdown don’t simply dismiss depression. It’s still there and it will most likely always be there. *Immunity* hit me like a brick. “Alewife”, the opening track, is stunningly beautiful. Every sound feels intentional, creating a warm and inviting environment — a safe space where feelings and troubled pasts can openly be discussed. On the track, Clairo delves into the night in eighth-grade where she almost ended her own life, only saved by the loving concern of her best friend. The first time I heard this song I wept. I bawled my eyes out like I did on that day six years ago in my eighth-grade English class. The backing piano is light and ethereal in a way that makes the contents feel like a distant memory, something to look back on and say ‘hey, I’ve overcome this.’ And that’s the biggest compliment I can give to this song. The song doesn’t just tell a story, it reassures that there is beauty in life, and despite all the bumpy roads and shitty situations we find ourselves in, life moves on and we’re able to say *‘I fought through that. I am strong.’* I’ve listened to the track dozens of times since, and I still can’t help but cry whenever I hear it. # We could be so strong As the album progresses forward, a unifying theme is uncovered throughout all the songs. *Strength.* As Clairo softly delivers the last lines of “Alewife” singing “eighth-grade was never that tight,” It shows a tongue in cheek acceptance of the past and the strength it took to overcome the traumatic situation. Being strong doesn’t mean that you can never hurt or show pain, it means that you can have a shitty day or think shitty thoughts and still believe in yourself and your self-worth. This strength is best demonstrated through the track “Impossible,” where Clairo has an argument with herself, wondering if she was the reason why a prior relationship failed. There are moments of guilt and self-doubt as she apologizes for not being good enough, or for missing this person’s affection, and asks questions like “am I amusing?”, looking for a shortcoming in herself. In the bridge, she takes a step back and examines her negative ramblings and comes to the conclusion that it’s most important to address her own and needs and “listen to my breathing and start believing myself.” Clairo fully comes to terms with her relationship on “White Flag.” Instead of drowning the song in questioning and self-doubt, she accepts that the past will always remain in the past, and that her love belongs just a memory. Maybe she wasn’t the one who wasn’t good enough in the relationship, but it was the other party for making her doubt herself the way that she did. Despite the heaviness of the album, it also strives to have fun. Lead single “Bags” is an absolute joy and one of the catchiest songs of the year. With a simple three-chord progression and a distorted piano line, Clairo sings about her first experience catching feelings for another woman. The song is riddled with anxiety, but is turns those emotions into positive energy, morphing the track into an indie-rock banger. “Sofia”, the seventh track, is joyous. Beginning from the offset with a sharp guitar riff, followed immediately with a dance-y drumbeat. Again, Clairo continues to explore her sexuality and reminisces about having crushes on famous women as a child, but always having the feeling that her attraction was wrong. She combats this by singing “you and I shouldn’t feel like a crime.” Halfway through the song, the sharp guitar riff turns distorted and powerful like an act of rebellion — protesting those who believe that there is something inherently wrong with how she feels. *Immunity* concludes with a retrospective of all the emotions covered throughout the album, and ties up looses ends with one general statement. “I Wouldn’t Ask You” is divided into two distinct sections. Single, long ringing piano chords solemnly introduce the foundation of the first section of the song, only interrupted by the delicate singing of Clairo accompanied by a children’s choir repeating the words “i wouldn’t ask you to take care of me”. The first section culminates the negative emotions she covered throughout the album — the guilt and self-doubt. The subdued nature of this section provides a stark contrast to the second section, which features a drum machine and more active piano toying. Here, Clairo and the choir reaffirm the theme of the album, singing “we could be so strong. We’ll be alright.” There are times of weakness throughout the album, but she ends it on a note of strength and positivity, and that’s really beautiful. # Why does it feel like I’m older than I asked to be? After hearing *Immunity*, Clairo quickly cemented herself as one of my favourite artists of all-time. In November, I had the chance to travel to Los Angeles with my best friend to attend a music festival where she was performing. I knew that I would be covering *Immunity* for this write-up, so I decided to try my luck and contact Claire to see if I could interview her. My method: a business email in the form of an Instagram DM. I sent it without much thought, and *holy shit.* After 15 minutes and a couple of texts, we had agreed to meet up. Now, when you’re in a crowd of thousands of people, it turns out that your phone becomes utterly useless. Only in specific spots could my phone get even a measly signal, and when Clairo took the stage, I was at the very front of the pit — no escape. It wasn’t until an hour later that I was finally able to struggle my way through the crowd of bodies and regain internet connection. I sat and waited for an hour until my phone died with no response. I missed my opportunity. The whole situation had me extremely bummed out. I understand that life happens, but I couldn’t stop kicking and criticizing myself. It wasn’t only that I had the opportunity to talk to one of my favourite artists, or that I now have to ramble in this write-up because I have no coherent idea about how to write this. It was the fact that I had the chance to meet the artist whose music could’ve connected to how I felt in eighth-grade, and assured that what I was feeling was alright. But like *Immunity* often reminds, life happens and there’s no use getting caught up on something that’s already transpired. And when it comes down to it, that’s why *Immunity* is so special to me. When I listen to tracks like “Alewife”, and “I Wouldn’t Ask You”, I think back to where I was six years ago and I’m able to reflect and tell myself that I’m alright. My hope for *Immunity* is that it’s able to reach kids who are experiencing those feelings right now and need something to tell them that what they’re going through is alright. If this album is able to reach out to one kid and make their struggle just a little bit easier, then it has fully served its purpose, and that makes me happy. **Favorite Lyrics** >In Massachusetts > >Only 30 minutes from Alewife > >I lay in my room > >Wonderin' why I've got this life > > > >It's been so long > >And you've been my sister all along > >But you know I'll be alright > >Eighth grade was never that tight * “Alewife” >But I know, know that it's right > >To listen to my breathing and start believing myself * “Impossible” >I think we could do it if we trie > >dIf only to say you're mine > >Sofia, know that you and I > >Shouldn't feel like a crime > > > >I just wanna say > >How I love you with your hair down * “Sofia” >Every night > >Think of things I can't do or haven't done > >And does it make me weak? > >Sometimes I feel like I can't breathe > >Is that all you see in me? * “Sinking” >We could be so strong. * “I Wouldn’t Ask You” **Talking Points** * What are your thoughts on *Immunity*?

761,"OPEN LETTER TO MINISTER OF JUSTICE Mr S. DEKKER FROM ITALYWe wrote an open letter to Mr S. Dekker, Holland ministry of Justice. Why? Because our blog [testimonidigeovaconsapevoli.blogspot.com](https://testimonidigeovaconsapevoli.blogspot.com) was mentioned as a vitriolic website from the three experts hired by WTS. Here is our letter. Have a good reading... ""Milan, Italy 6 February, 2020 &#x200B; Dear Minister Of Justice, Mr. Dekker, We would like to communicate with you in relation to what is happening in Holland with the Church of Jehovah's Witnesses and their policy on minors' protection within their congregations. I represent a group of former Jehovah's Witness activists who have held positions of responsibility within the Church. We are also the authors of the blog [http://testimonidigeovaconsapevoli.blogspot.com/](http://testimonidigeovaconsapevoli.blogspot.com/) which was called into question by the three experts used by the Watchtower to respond to the conclusions of the University of Utrecht that your Office commissioned. I am not dissociated from the Church of Jehovah's Witnesses, we are forced to use aliases cause shunning policy practiced by the Watchtower. We enclose our answer to the expert opinion written by Introvigne Folk & Melton. Our answer was published on our blog and the newspaper L'Indro of Turin ([https://www.lindro.it/](https://www.lindro.it/)) will publish an article related to this topic. I hope it will be helpful, and we thank you for what you do to help the victims and refugees of this coercive sect. Yours Sincerely, Corrado Palazzi &#x200B; And Testimoni di Geova Consapevoli Staff &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; My personal email: [corrado.palazzi@gmail.com](mailto:corrado.palazzi@gmail.com) &#x200B; ***Some thoughts on Expert Opinion by Introvigne-Folk-Melton commissioned by Jehovah Witnesses*** Following the publication of the **Utrecht University Report** ([https://www.wodc.nl/onderzoeksdatabase/3010-aangiftebereidheid-binnen-de-gemeenschap-van-jehovaes-getuigen.aspx](https://www.wodc.nl/onderzoeksdatabase/3010-aangiftebereidheid-binnen-de-gemeenschap-van-jehovaes-getuigen.aspx)), the Jehovah's Witnesses of Netherlands commissioned Holly Folk, Massimo Introvigne and J. Gordon Melton to write a sort of ""expert opinion"" in defense of the organization and highlight all the possible mistakes made by Utrecht researchers. The document is public, written in English and is available on the Dutch Government website, at the official address: [https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/rapporten/2020/01/23/tk-bijlage-1-expert-opinion](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/rapporten/2020/01/23/tk-bijlage-1-expert-opinion) What has been surprising to us is that, within their document, among the myriad of internet pages, forums and blogs of denunciation against the organization of the JWs, in the web, the three academics have chosen to mention precisely our blog ""Testimoni di Geova Consapevoli"". We are grateful for the free advert, however we cannot help sharing their arguments with our readers and getting to the bottom of the arguments. With this four-handed article, Eliseo and Corrado will enter into the merits of both the accusations received by this blog and the clumsy attempts by the three academics to defend the WTS, discrediting the work of Utrecht researchers. For those who do not have time and opportunity to read the entire PDF document, we summarize the content below: Paragraphs 1-5: the three scholars list skills, titles, collaborations, books, etc. Paragraphs 6-12: methodological problems. They praise the intellectual honesty and professional integrity of Utrecht researchers, but try to show weaknesses in research methods. Since researchers also used online questionnaires in addition to the in-person interviews, Introvigne and colleagues argue that trolls would have easily falsified the questionnaires, despite any University precautions. Among these trolls, there would be ""well-organized patronage groups"", among whom they point out to managers of the Italian blog Aware Jehovah's Witnesses. Furthermore, they argue that the views of former members of the religion are imbued with ""prejudice"", thus raising doubts about the validity of their responses. Paragraphs 13-22: the results, ""closed community"". It is argued that the JWs are not a closed community, or at least not less than Islam and the Catholic Church. Paragraphs 23-26: sexual abuse among the JW. It is claimed that in recent years the JW have implemented a series of changes in relation to the management of cases of pedophilia and that the dissatisfaction of management is due to the subjective perception of individuals victims of pedophilia. Paragraphs 27-30: recommendations. Reporting obligation for all cases of abuse. It is considered “*unfair that Jehovah’s Witnesses should “submit a yearly report” on how they deal with sexual abuse through an internal desk*”, because other communities are not required to do so. There is no agreement on the recommendation to “*allow women to “have decisive roles” in the hierarchy of their community at all levels*“. And in the end it is argued that the JWs “*are a fragile community, more exposed than others to slander and stereotypes*”, “*the group most targeted by anti-sect literature and propaganda in Europe*”. So, the first argument is of a conspiracy type. So much so that, in paragraph 9, the three authors need to specify that they do not intend to support “*mere conspiracy theories*” (excusatio non petita). Behind the methodological problems there would be the danger of the trolls. They define blogs like this (quoting it directly by its web address) as “*well-organized advocacy groups*” and “*skilled organizations*”. After that, they go so far as to associate these blogs with Russia, claiming that they have the intent to make anti-Jehovah’s Witnesses propaganda by creating fake accounts and all that is needed to put the JWs in a bad light. To the three authors (and to the WTS leaders who are reading us), we are here to confirm what we believe they know very well: we are a handful of men who fight with bare hands to shed light on what this organization has hidden for decades and continues to hide from their followers, in particular as regards their legal matters concerning the protection of minors. It is a fact that when they become aware of certain issues that had been concealed from them and begin to seek enlightenment from their elders, overseers or by writing to the Branch of their country, they are labeled as weak and spiritually dangerous subjects. If they continue in this wake and talk to other “brothers” about these causes, they are disfellowshipped and shunned by all the affections, including relatives and family members. This is the simple reality of the facts. If the authors can’t get these mechanisms, maybe there is not the necessary knowledge and competence to talk about the organization of the Jehovah’s Witnesses. The issue of shunning brings us to the heart of the matter. Paragraph 17 uses the straw man fallacy (used in other parts of the discussion, regarding logical errors attributed to Utrecht researchers), attempting to refute the question by proposing an incorrect and distorted representation of it. We find embarrassing the argument that “*apostates from Islam should be killed*”. Not to mention the quote from Deuteronomy 13: 6–16 which “*allowed Jews to kill apostates excluded from the community*”. Fortunately, civilization has evolved. If we want to take the world of radical Islam and the Taliban as a model of civilization, then we will drop all discussion. If, on the other hand, we want to talk about what is still happening in 2020 in an avant-garde society like the Dutch one, we cannot but remain indignant at the lack of respect for human dignity that characterizes practices such as shunning. We had already shown in this blog the dissonance between what was requested by the leaders of the Jehovah’s Witnesses with the shunning of their friends, relatives and family members and what was declared on December 10, 1984 by the United Nations General Assembly in the “***Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment***”. The first article of the Convention defines the term “**torture**” as follows: ""*The term ""torture"" means any act by which* ***severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental****, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession,* ***punishing him for an act*** *he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or* ***coercing*** *him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity*” (Bold is ours) **Shunning is a torture practice** that injures those who practice it and those who suffer it. Once again, there is a lack of knowledge of the internal dynamics of the sect, when the report states: ""*as explicitly stated in official documents by the Jehovah’s Witnesses, nobody should be disfellowshipped for reporting a case of abuse to the secular authorities*."" In the book “*Shepherd the flock of God*” (by the three authors cited in a guilty way) at chapter 12 point 39 we read that among the reasons of disfellowshipping with consequent shunning there is “*Causing Divisions, Promoting Sects*: \[...\] *This would be deliberate action disrupting the unity of the congregation or undermining the confidence of the brothers in Jehovah’s arrangement.*” Obviously in words the Watch Tower protects itself by saying “*we abhor child abuse*” and in writing that “*the victim, her parents, or anyone else who reports such an allegation to the elders should be clearly informed that they have the right to report the matter to the secular authorities. Elders do not criticize anyone who chooses to make such a report*”. The reality is, however, that people are often asked to “*leave things in Jehovah's hands*.” And if anyone were to do anything ""*disrupting the unity of the congregation*"" they would be disfellowshipped (shunned). We personally know hundreds of situations of this kind. Either one pretends not to know, or once again there is little knowledge and competence of these dynamics. Moreover, the quote made by the book “*Shepherd the flock of God*” which says that it can be reported “*even if the accusation is not proven*” is totally de-contextualized. Have the three authors been provided with the entire book or partial quotations to be used for the harangue? That part is not found in chapter 14 ""*Child abuse*"", but in chapter 12 point 24 “*Fraud, slander*”. Attempts are made to discredit the testimony of the ex-members with the banal approach to the experience of a divorce, when there is a boundless sociological and psychological scientific literature on the topic of social exclusion and its consequences on the health of the person (see e.g. Williams, Forgas and Von Hippel). Too bad that this is kept silent by Introvigne and colleagues. Finding more information would be enough to understand the magnitude of torture that the shunning of the Church of Jehovah’s Witnesses inflicts on those who have simply changed their minds. Given that an essential tool of the sociologist is the statistical analysis that derives from statistically significant data, we invite Dr. Introvigne and the other two authors to scroll the pages of reddit at [https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw](https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw) /. Some numbers: \- 46,400 members \- 250k daily readers Certainly reading some of these pages (excellently moderated with censorship of inappropriate languages) would show that the three authors deserve a quantitative and qualitative sociological analysis. Families destroyed, children in disarray, acute suffering, to the point of suicide. All without a single word of all this reaching the ears of ordinary Witnesses. The number of PIMOs (""physically in, mentally out"") hosted by this exclusively English-speaking site is impressive, which speaks volumes about the cruelty of these practices. We do not pretend to say this, but an emeritus person like Judge Peter McClelland (President of the Australian Royal Commission), on March 10, 2017, described the shunning practice of Jehovah's Witnesses leaders as “*cruel*”. Another difficult statement to accept is that the Jehovah’s Witnesses are not a **closed community**, coming to argue that if the JWs are, the Catholic Church is too. We are dismayed by Professor Introvigne's marked change of opinion on this point. In fact, at the Rimini Meeting on August 28, 1990, he claimed: “*I quote three reactions quickly behind the new religiosity. The first is the temptation to escape, the reactive temptation. In the face of complex society we take refuge in islands that* ***cut all the bridges with society****. So certainly you are not of the world but you are no longer even in the world. They are the* ***separate realms*** *that groups that* ***isolate themselves from the social context****,* ***such as Jehovah's Witnesses for example, tend to build more and more*****.**“ ([https://youtu.be/7WbEsulYs34](https://youtu.be/7WbEsulYs34) from minute 13 onwards, the original is in Italian, we have translated here it in English). We don't understand what made Dr. Introvigne change his mind. The authors show an evident superficiality in the judgment. What establishes that Jehovah's Witnesses are not a closed community? Even if the three authors say that some of them have attended the JWs, it does not seem that they realize that, from the same official publications of the Witnesses, the prohibition to participate in **moments of community inclusion**, such as **holidays** (religious or secular), **extracurricular or non-working activities**, political **vote** at all levels, attending exclusively their co-religionists, weddings within the church itself and not least the “modulated” shunning in relation to the degree of spirituality of the adept, the absolute absence of criticism and the contradictory, clearly speak of a closed community. To be recognized as a Jehovah's Witness, part of the community, therefore, you need to go through some **steps**: “studying” their publications with a baptized Witness, enrolling in the Theocratic Ministry School, becoming an unbaptized publisher and then, only after passing all these filters , getting baptized. At each of these steps there are several interviews with local pastors, who try to understand if the person is “suitable”, or if he is applying a series of internal rules. The book published by Jehovah's Witnesses “*Organized to Do Jehovah's Will*” on page 70, lists some of these rules or “requirements” for becoming a “*publisher*” (the step before the baptism). One of them says precisely: “*He sees the value of avoiding unwholesome association*”. Every Witness know that dealing with this point, the elders make sure that the person has **cut the bridges with his friends ""in the world""**, that are “non-Jehovah's Witnesses”. Dozens of times this concept is reiterated in the magazines and in the speeches held during the TdG meetings (the bold is ours): “*Unnecessary entanglements with the world can prove disastrous.*” (Kingdom Ministry 12/93) “*spending too much time with workmates or school associates who have no regard for righteous principles takes its toll. We are wise to limit our association with people who are negative or who are promoting an independent attitude.*” (The Watchtower 2012, Feb 15th) “*Would it not be equally dangerous —not to mention time consuming— to ‘party’ or ‘hang out’ with schoolmates who are not Christians? \[...\] Remember, what is immoral to Christians is often a way of life to others! The same would hold true of associating with wicked people by means of immoral music, suggestive dances, or books and movies that feature violence and sexual immorality*.” (Awake! 1986, Nov 8th) Then we move on to the topic of sexual abuse. The changes that have taken place in the last few years referred to were made following pressure from the Royal Australian Commission and with poor practical results. In paragraph 24 it is argued that ""*the Jehovah’s Witnesses do not sponsor or provide any activities that separate children from their parents or otherwise take custody of children*"". This is taken (and the three authors omit this) from the document ""***Jehovah’s Witnesses’ Scripturally Based Position on Child Protection***"" (available at the link [https://www.jw.org/en/news/legal/legal-resources/information/packet-jw-scripturally-based-position-child-protection/](https://www.jw.org/en/news/legal/legal-resources/information/packet-jw-scripturally-based-position-child-protection/)) Paragraph 7 says: “*Congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses do not separate children from their parents for the pur- pose of instruction or other activities.*“ **This is false**. Jehovah's Witnesses are known for two-by-two preaching. A Jehovah's Witness can often be seen going door to door with a child. This child is not necessarily a relative of the adult. Indeed, it can often happen that it is not. So, Jehovah's Witnesses organize activities (the **preaching activity**) in which children are separated from their parents. The continuation of the reasoning therefore does not apply to Jehovah's Witnesses. Another bias or red herring can be seen in paragraph 25. The changes that are currently only on paper are highlighted. These changes were cleverly written in a very ambiguous language. In no official publication to the public or to the adepts is it, for example, mentioned that any report to the authorities, even in the event of a legal obligation, must **always be preceded by a telephone communication with the local Branch** pending instructions. We think this comments on its own. Obviously the three academics do not mention this. Some improvements are on such an obvious basis that they only seem obvious, such as not comparing the victim with the alleged executioner, which is the ABC of the common sense. To argue, in paragraph 26, that the “*dissatisfaction with handling*” is a victim perception, is embarrassingly tautological. **Satisfaction is by definition a perception**. It was precisely this perception that Utrecht scholars intended to measure, not to give an absolute score but to compare satisfaction levels when cases are handled internally compared to when they are handled by the authorities. In fact, what Intovigne, Folk and Melton are careful not to highlight is the **difference in satisfaction** with handling by the police (which receives an average score of **6.4**) compared to the internal handling of the JWs (which receives a score of **3.3**). Furthermore, after trying to discredit the validity of the questionnaires throughout the first part of the document, it is not clear how the data on abuse and dissatisfaction can now be taken for granted by the three authors. Paragraph 30 concludes ad libitum that the JWs are “*the group most targeted by anti-sect literature and propaganda in Europe*”, saying that they “*are a fragile community, more exposed than others to slander and stereotypes*” It is a classic leitmotif of the JWs and many sects. **The appeal to martyrism**. We recall a publication by Massimo Introvigne that defines Jehovah's Witnesses as “*martyrs*” of Nazism. While respecting the death and decision of each individual, we invite Introvigne to carefully reread F. Rutherford's endorsement letter to Hitler and the subsequent hysterical letter, also from the then president of the Watch Tower Society. Needless to say, Christ stood before those who wanted to harm his disciples. Even if we do not have the counter-proof, a more prudent attitude could perhaps save some lives. Furthermore, if the first statement were true (which should be proven) one would have to ask why. The fact remains that it is a circular reasoning. In conclusion, distinguished professors, we would like to define your 21 pages as a **weak** and **spoiled** defense attempt. Sorry, because this blog is made up of people who want to help those who suffer and moan inside and outside this organization. We invite you to interview yourself the thousands of people who have left the organization, to measure the deep pain that pervades it. People believed they found comfort, hope, but have been used to support a mere human organization where few people live behind many and enjoy their almost absolute power. A Facebook page collects real-life stories of people who lost their lives because of this organization's policies or who took it off: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/671073623227956/?ref=share](https://www.facebook.com/groups/671073623227956/?ref=share). In thanking you for reading us, we remain available for constructive dialogue, Eliseo and Corrado",
762,"This is probably going to get downvoted to high hell, but...I fear this is going to sound selfish, or whiny, or something. Or that I'm going to offend people here. That's not my intention, and if people take this the wrong way I'll just delete this... I've never given myself down time. Besides one day, I've never put life on hold for my mental well-being. In Highschool I showed up out of fear and obligation. Fear of my life getting too complicated if I admitted how depressed I was. Fear of my mom getting upset with me because I didn't want to go to school. As a young adult I was the one with a constant, steady job. I moved out at a young age and needed to provide for myself. I needed food and insurance, money for my car and rent. Even through suicidal ideations, even through not sleeping and crying all night, I'd go to work the next day. If it was the weekend I'd do grocery shopping or whatever else had to be done. Now as an adult I'm much more stable, the most stable I've ever been. I have a house and two wonderful children and a beautiful family... It's much of the same; I'm still the insurance provider...I have a mortgage to pay...I *need* this job, I *need* to do everything in my power to keep it... This is the part where people might be angry... I'm jealous of the people that can just check out. I want to once, just once, wake up and say screw this and just go back to bed. But I can't. Even on weekends no one respects my space. My daughter wants me. There's things to do. Even the one day I left work without telling anyone and went to the library for the day...*I still went to work*. I wanted to die, and I felt like I was outside of my body, and everyone at work was asking if I was ok because I wasn't even able to hide it, so I lied and said I had a migraine and left. And my husband doesn't know because he'd be pissed, he'd think that I was jeopardizing my job and our stability... He's made leaps and bounds in understanding but still isn't there yet... I just want to break. In my entire life I've never been able to. When I was a child I had to be mature due to circumstances. Crumpling wasn't an option. It's never been an option. But it's just too much. Everything weighing down on me for so long... Pressing on for so long...When do I just get to be me? So many people rely on me... When is enough enough?",
763,"Trigger Warning: Psychedelic SuicideObvious trigger warning, I am going to talk about suicide. If that will upset you please skip this post. I turned 30 this November, No one was as shocked as me! For a long time I would have told you my base state was somewhat suicidal. Not always extreme or a worry. Just a thought that underpinned everything in my life. For instance if you gave me a button that would remove me from reality without a trace, or moment of pain for my loved ones. I would have pushed it in a second. Its like the old joke, ""My car broke down, I could fix it, Abandon it, or kill myself."" But i was like that with literally everything. ""Should I do this or that, or just kill myself."" I was in the hospital in 2017 for a severe depression episode. It started slow but built to the point every other thought was actively suicidal. I had plans, I had dates, I was ready... One morning I woke up and I was in so much pain. There was only one thought on my mind. To go get my parents gun and end my life. I actually left the house that morning with the intent of doing just that. By the time i was in the car and driving, I was so deep in my head i started driving to work instead of my parents. I made the first wrong turn, and snapped out of it, and decided I could always do it tomorrow. I went to work and without being there an hour , I sent the text that saved my life. I texted my SO and mother ""I think its time for me to go to the hospital."" Left work and committed myself. I spent 12 hard days there but i got back on my feet. But I still wanted to die, The thought that i had made a mistake, that i shouldn't have sent that text plagued me for months. Once I shared this feeling with those close to me it got weaker, lost its power over me. Fast forward to the end of Oct 2019. I am forced to move apart from my SO. I felt like i failed us, like i was worthless, and I just didn't know how to life apart from her and be okay. Not that i would recommend anyone try anything from this story so far. But im doubly reminding everyone that now. The last night of the move was the first night we HAD to sleep apart. We've done it before but this was different. It was like she was stolen from me by my failures. In a moment of desperation I dont regret. I committed what I am calling, Psychadelic Suicide. I took 6 tabs of LSD, for those who care dose totaled 750ug. The story of the rest of the night is posted on this account if thats something you want to hear. But for this post ill just copy the TLDR "" TL:DR I dropped 750ug after being awake for over 24h, Watched the Suicidal part of me lose once and for all to a newly discovered part that wants to live. I switch teams in my head, Life gets easier! "" The change I want to talk about here isn't some coping mechanism, its not some trick i play on myself. I genuinely would prefer to be alive for the first time I can remember. I never planned past 30 because I assumed I would give in by then and be dead anyway. I let go of the feeling of wanting to be dead that night. It was hard, suicide was always so comforting to me. No matter how bad it got I always had an out, or so I thought. But I wasn't living life, I wasn't taking care of myself. I spent many sleepless nights on suicide watch, [lostallhope.com](https://lostallhope.com/), and other neutral or pro suicide sites. Logically I was convinced that I was better off dead. I believe that was my fault for allowing the thoughts to consume me whole. My issue now is that i need to plan like i never have before. I want to see 60 now, I might even want a child someday! My advice to anyone struggling like i was isn't ground breaking, or anything you haven't heard. But I believe these things are true. 1. Plan actions not results. If you only plan what you are going to \*Do\* not whats going to \*Happen\* you wont be as disappointed. All that can happen is you do it or not. 2. Thoughts will pop up about anything and everything. The best thing to do is nothing. Just let it wash over you until its gone. Dont embrace it or push it away, just let it be. 3. Reach out to someone, anyone. If you are going to hurt yourself call someone, anyone. There are resources everywhere if you dont have someone personal and close to you. I know it can be terrifying to admit to these feelings. But it is the first step on the road to recovery! 4. I dont know shit, talk to a doctor. Seriously Im only in my head, I am not a professional, I just want to see you get through this. TL:DR: I was going to kill myself before i turned 30, but didn't thanks to My doctor, My SO, My family, and My drugs. I would advocate for high dose experiences in a safe environment for people seriously at the end of their rope. What do you guys think?",

She’s technically not a dragon, but rather a lesser draconic being, closer to mononokes like [Mizuchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizuchi) or Orochi. It’s possible that a lot of his exploits during the Bakumatsu had her help behind the curtains. Or maybe not. By the way, unluckily enough, Ryouma’s last moments happened while she was away, which means she couldn’t help him. Consumed by sadness, she disappeared into the depths of the oceans, beyond human reach, turned into a dragon and never soared the skies again. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pronouns (Ryouma) First person: Boku/washi (in Tosa Dialect Mode) Second person: Kimi/oman (in Tosa Dialect Mode) Third person: Aitsura/omanra (in Tosa Dialect Mode) Pronouns (Oryou-san) First person: Oryou-san Second person: omae/name without honorifics Third person: omaera/name without honorifics ------------------------------------------------------------------------ **Personality** Sakamoto Ryouma, the Hero of the Restoration. An aloof man on his mid-20s. He may be a master of the [Hokushin Ittouryuu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokushin_Itt%C5%8D-ry%C5%AB), but he’s actually a kindhearted guy who dislikes conflict to his very core. In a Holy Grail War set in Japan, he would be a powerful Servant with a unique type of Riding Noble Phantasm and fame levels that rival Oda Nobunaga. In order to hide his True Name, he speaks in standard textbook Japanese, but he lets some Tosa regional expression slip every now and then. He left his name in history without trying to, just by doing everything he could for the kind people around him. The problem with his personality is that he’s easy to like and easy to misunderstand. Since he acts so aloof, no one can tell what his intentions are, furthering the problem. For that reason, he lived a life with many allies and many enemies. His partner Oryou-san is not [the one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narasaki_Ry%C5%8D) from historical fact, but rather an ungodly something that was sealed, pierced stuck to one mountain. Ryouma, at the heights of his youthful impetuosity, pulls off the sealing spear and releases her. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ **Likes** Mackerel sashimi, wild chicken stew (but wild chicken stew gives bad luck, so he avoids eating it). Foreign ships, travelling, new things. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Dislikes** People with prejudice against those of different birth or education. Suicidal thoughts. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Attitude towards the Master** He wishes to have a good friendship with his Master no matter who they are, without exceptions. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Dialogue examples** Ryouma: “Serpent of the landmass, sequestered to [Amasakahoko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amenonuhoko)… I only know of my deeds. Amakakeru Ryuu ga Gotoku!” Oryou: “Haaaaaaaaaa!!!!” Ryouma: “Yeah, most of the times, I move when it’s already too late. Well, better late than never, in my opinion.” Oryou: “Ryoma has some screws loose, so I need to babysit him.” Oryou: “Hey hey, you gonna chicken out?” Ryouma: “Stop, don’t provoke them.” ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Historical Character and Figure** Sakamoto Ryouma, a low-ranking samurai from the Tosa domain. One of the [shishi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shishi_(organization)) who contributed the most to the Meiji Restoration, being the central figure of the Satchou Alliance, founder of the [Kaientai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaientai), and proposer of the restoration of imperial rule. As a child, he was considered an underachiever, to the point he was expelled from his cram school supposedly for bad results. But once he started his sword training, his skills increased remarkably fast. Later on, he travels to Edo to study swordsmanship and joins the Chiba dojo to train the Hokushin Ittouryuu. At the time, Commodore Perry’s fleet of American black ships come to the Uraga seas and seeing that was very meaningful for the later parts of his life. After returning to Tosa, he joins the Tosa Loyalist Party formed by Takechi Zuizan. However, he later deserts Tosa to live in the Chiba dojo in Edo. There he finally meets Katsu Kaishuu and becomes his disciple. This encounter would lead to great changes in Japan’s history later down the line. Thanks to Katsu Kaishuu’s intervention, he was absolved from the crime of desertion. Then he did everything he could to advance Katsu Kaishuu’s plans of founding a training grounds for marines. And when that’s done, he works there as a head naval instructor. The changing trends of the time lead to the start of a suppression movement against the Tosa Loyalist Party, casting a dark shadow over his friends Takechi and Izou. Ryouma even receives orders to return to his land, but he ignores it, branding him a deserter for the second time. In 1865, after multiple incidents like the [Ikedaya Incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikedaya_incident) and [Kinmon Rebellion]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinmon_incident), he founds the Kameyama Shachuu (later known as the Kaientai), an organazition very similar in personality to modern corporations. Through deals of arms and ammunition, he achieves the great feat of mediating the long-time enemies Choushuu and Satsuma, forming the Satchou Alliance. At that time, events like the Teradaya Incident, where Ryouma’s dissenters go after his life, started becoming more frequent, but that didn’t stop him. He continued his work, which included writing a project for new national structure, titled Eight Proposals While Shipboard. However, 1 month after the emperor returns to power, he is assassinated in Oomiya, Kyoto. Died aged 33. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Character in Fate/GO** I didn’t want to cut anyone, I didn’t want to shoot anyone. At first, it was for the kids in his neighborhood, then it was for his friends from his village, then it was for his comrades-in-arms, then it was for the nation of Japan. He was born with a kindheartedness that made him constantly challenge the eras for the sake of someone else, from beginning to end. Everyone liked him, everyone found him unsettling, and in the end, when he was cruelly murdered, he left the living world with no grudges or regrets about it. From beginning to end, he was dreaming of a society where everyone would have an enjoyable life. That’s all there was to it. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Usual Weapons** Katana (Mutsu-no-Kami Yoshiyuki) Pistol Gracious pair-up attacks with his partner Oryou-san. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ **Related Characters** Oryou-san: Despite her seemingly wild and unhinged behavior, they are in a relationship where both are ready to shield the other from danger at a pinch. Okada Izou: His best friend from his hometown. Ryouma still considers him his best friend even now, but their relationship was never repaired ever since they parted ways. Okita Souji: When he was alive, catching a glimpse of her swordsmanship made him feel hopeless dread. “It’s very comforting to have her as an ally this time.” Hijikata Toshizou: When they were alive, their incompatible ideologies made them enemies. “That said, he’s a very realiable of an ally now.” Oda Nobunaga: He admires her dignity and innovative ideas. Oryou-san hates because she’s at an almost hyperlevel of combat disadvantage. Okita Souji (Alter): Shows concern over her circumstances, as he has some responsibility over it. Katsu Kaishuu: His unofficial master. Ryouma first visited him with the intention of killing him, but Katsu’s words earned his admiration and devotion, so Ryouma became his disciple. Takechi Zuizan: A like-minded member of Tosa Loyalist Party. They once aimed for the same goal but came to part ways due to ideological differences. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- **Comments from the illustrator** I think every Gudaguda character commission I get is a reason to party. I’m always going “Woohoo! Here we go! Drawing time!”. You guys have no idea how much I want to draw more Japanese outfits. I want Oryou-san^1 to fight using Oryou^2 yo-yos. (pako) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Translation notes: 1) As in Ryou Narasaki, Ryouma’s irl wife, not his dragon NP. 2) As in Ryouma’s dragon NP, not his irl wife.",
765,"[Translation] Author's twitter comments on Episode 4 of the Director's CutSource: Starting from [https://twitter.com/nezumiironyanko/status/1219990728098471937](https://twitter.com/nezumiironyanko/status/1219990728098471937) Nagatsuki-sensei has been tweeting commentary on the new episodes. Here's this week's batch. Spoiler warning: Some post-anime content is incidentally referenced. Rough translation: Yes! This week, once more, it's time for the new edition of Re: Zero! Today is the content from episode 6 and 7! So fast! What happened to Subaru last time after his startled eyes went rolling? He died! It continues from there. Please join us. Out of the ways he's died so far, that was by far the harshest. From Ram and Rem's viewpoint, the moment they came to check on the condition of an injured person, he suddenly screams and writhes around, so it's no wonder they were startled. ""What hour of what day is it?"" is a line that can't be left out of time-related stories. It would be best if there were a convenience store and a newspaper as well, but you can't find them in this world. They had the OP, but there's no commercials, then. Retreating temporarily from being in front of Ram and Rem, he goes to another room to calm down and collect his thoughts. I'm rather like that as well, but don't you walk in circles around the room while thinking or talking on the phone? Certainly, the books in the forbidden library don't get aired out, do they. Having said that, this is, more or less, a place where even bugs can't get in without Beatrice's permission, isn't it. I suspect that ""Poop sticks"" (note: play on words; the term used for poop here is also a pronunciation for luck) is not something that Puck taught her, but an old proverb that she learned on her own. Puck is using water magic here, but although he's a fire spirit in terms of affinity, he can make some use of other spells. You'll understand later, he can use shadow magic as well. In regards to times that Subaru almost kills Emilia, if you set aside where he almost made her die of laughter here...... Ah, no no, let's not say that this week. The Subaru in ""Subaru Natsuki"" is the name of the constellation (note: Subaru is the Japanese name for the Pleiades), so ""My number-one star"" is what Subaru sees as his best pick-up line. Despite that, where he chooses to use it is, well... Last time, he tried to do the same things as the first time around, but he failed. At the point he thought ""I'll try doing the same things as last time."" and tried doing it, his conduct is already different from the first round, so the theory is it's impossible to act exactly the same way. With sneezing, burping, and yawning, nee-sama's reaction differs each time, but this isn't a physiological reaction, rather you can tell that Ram is consciously doing it to change the topic at the breakfast table. No longer a servant and the same as them, choosing to be treated as a guest put a lot of feeling of distance between himself and Ram and Rem. Ironically, although he wants to help them more than he did the first time around, his reception from them worsens. ""Shaman"" Beatrice says mana draining is simple, but even then the people that can manage it are limited in number, so it's not as simple as she says. If you have the talent to do it, it's not a difficult technique, however. It's a question of whether you're suited to it or not. I feel like we talked last time about how healing magic doesn't restore lost blood, but still, Beatrice's healing magic is something else......isn't quite right, but for the moment, let's say that Beatrice put all his guts back inside. In the Overlord game commercial, arranging Ainz-sama and Petelgeuse on both sides gives it an amazingly hellish feeling. Speaking only of Emilia's personal safety, Puck is very quick on the uptake. Regarding anything besides that, he often just goes along with the flow of the conversation. The tea that Ram brews is one of a very limited number of jobs in the mansion where she's clearly better at it than Rem, but Subaru has the tongue of a child, so he he doesn't like tea much to begin with. With coffee, too, unless it's about as sweet as cafe-au-lait, he can't drink it. ""The Red Oni who Cried"" is the author's favorite fairy tale, but at the script meetings, we got quite bogged down over it. Around how famous is it, how much do we have to tell for them to understand; this may have been the spot in the first cour where we had the most talks about changing the script. More or less, Ram is hearing it for the first time, so it has to be an explanation that will carry the meaning to someone hearing it for the first time, was the idea...... It's Kobayashi-san's achievement, but when I'm listening like this, Subaru seems like he might be good at recitations. On the other hand, you might wonder what her reaction would have been if Rem had been the one to hear ""The Red Oni who Cried"", but, well, I can't help but think she'd probably have had the opposite of Ram's opinion. The real reason behind nee-sama declining the story of the witch, that's season two, isn't it. Looking at it now, that was foreshadowing for things quite a ways ahead, wasn't it! What kind of complicated plot is this author up to!? Speaking of that, the final destination of the cup ramen and corn pottage snacks was decided on, but what happened to the convenience store bag...... this, too, is a valuable item. More or less, wrapping a lifeline around himself here isn't so much about being wary of being attacked, as it is being ready to scale down the cliff and run to the mansion when something happens there. It turned out all right. With the one dodge, Subaru has used up all his luck... Of course, if it came to a tug-of-war with the chain, he wouldn't stand a chance, but since he wasn't finished off in one shot, it creates an opportunity to talk, so she showed her face. It's the law. Of course, this is the truth of the iron ball that Subaru took a direct hit from last time, and the sound of chains that he heard. The story of the meeting between Rem and this morning star is written in a limited edition booklet included with season one's DVD. It's not really that moving a meeting, though! When I think about how it was useful in arc one, arc two, and arc three, the overtechnology known as a cell phone is really something that you can't leave out of a isekai story, isn't it? This is the most crucial question. The true intention behind Ram's interaction with Subaru really isn't that savage. It's a situation where Rem's initial goodwill towards him gets worse each time he ""Returns by Death"", so basically Ram is standing between her little sister and Subaru to keep them apart. At this point, I think you can tell if you look closely that Rem doesn't do anything, but the last line is deeply meaningful as well. The attack that gouged out Subaru's throat at the end was assisted death via Ram, who is watching from a distance. This, too, is assisted death...... The first penalty. In many stories, it's common to place focus on whether or not you can get people to believe you, but the problem for characters that have looped, since Re: Zero's nature is for the restart point to change each arc, it was possible that conversation would be repeated over and over, so that condition was removed. Honestly, I think it would be difficult to repeat ""I don't know if you'll believe me"" time after time. Hence, he can't talk about ""Return by Death"" to begin with, is the condition. As for why the witch forbids it, that comes later. The smell of the witch is called miasma in this world, but being able to sense it clearly takes a particular disposition. At the Roswaal manor, only Rem and Beatrice can tell. When you depend on her she'll do nothing but complain, but you can depend on Beatrice, so in that sense, Subaru picked the best person to depend on. No matter what, Subaru wants to get past Day X where tragedy occurs. He didn't choose the servant route this time, but a guest......that, too, he didn't choose himself, but he's in a position he was put in little by little, so it's difficult for Emilia and the others to intrude. Thanks to Beatrice, Subaru made quite a psychological comeback. The light has come back to his eyes. More or less, Beatrice exited, so the door that Subaru and Beatrice left from is the same... or it should be. She connected to a hallway with plenty of sunshine, so perhaps it was a mercy from Beatrice. I'm sure not even Beako could be aware of what has happened at this point. Subaru's speaking quickly at this point is both because he's made it past Day X, but also perhaps because he has a bad feeling about Emilia's reaction. I'm not sure what will come in the future, but I think I probably won't write a scene were Ram loses control more than she does here. Incidentally, Roswaal is unusually serious here. When he has his cheek injured in a blink by wind magic here, Subaru knows for sure who took out his throat in a blink in the forest last time around. if he'd been able to at least reveal ""Return by Death"" there would have been no need to run away, but he's being cornered, and the pain of the penalty is still fresh in his mind, so Subaru ends up running. Even Subaru, who's had an arm ripped off, is frightened of it, so one would have to think the penalty is seriously painful. Well, even with an arm ripped off, your heart would hurt, though. This cliff be used again in a chapter well in the future. How bad does the situation have to become before it's alright to die to redo it? It's the sort of think you don't want to think about very much, but at the least, suicide for the purpose of running away was a step that Subaru couldn't take. With this you can tell that Beatrice and the RamRem sisters have known each other for an unexpectedly long time. The instances weren't that frequent, but it was a long time, after all. (excited shriek)! She fell for it! ""Straight Bet"" is just too cool, and due to the implications of when it's translated into Japanese, I reimported it into the original novel's arc title. But seriously, it's a good insert song. I think that the nee-sama you see here is pushing herself well past her limits, but if she were to go all out here, I think that Subaru and Beatrice would have died instantly...... Subaru's line right here, even after writing quite a lot of Re: Zero, is in the top class of lines that I like. Here's the crossroads. Personally, I like that, after he looked so cool jumping, they mercilessly added sound effects during the credits. Yeah, that's fast. Ah, but the atmosphere has changed! Subaru Natsuki's dramatic return begins here! But does it really, wait, next week!! And with that, thanks for this week as well. But wow, the new edition is already on the fourth week. When I think of it that way, it's been really fast. Let's rush on this way to April! See you next week!! Bonus retweet from Yuusuke Kobayashi: No matter how many times I see it, I cry when I see restart...... And where he was telling the story of ""The Red Oni who Cried"", that was rerecorded. Some of you noticed. ^_^",
766,"Update: I´m calling CPS tomorrow, please tell me I´m doing the right thing.[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/dxpt2h/im_calling_cps_tomorrow_please_tell_me_im_doing/) [Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/dz0uje/update_2_im_calling_cps_tomorrow_please_tell_me/) [Update 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/evmvzq/update_3_im_calling_cps_tomorrow_please_tell_me/) *Context: a small country in Europe* Thank you for everyone that offered support and advice. This morning I visited my sister and secretly took a video of her living conditions. The place was especially filthy, she had just awoken from sleeping on the ground in the corner. I wanted to record her admitting that our mother is aware that she doesn´t eat, that she has depression etc. But somehow I must have clicked the button or something and it didn´t record or deleted or whatever. I feel stupid for losing that. But I still have the video and 2 adult witnesses to confirm that she has said those things. She hadn´t eaten and said that there´s nothing in the fridge that she is able to eat and I promised I´d come back and bring her whatever she wants. She asked for fries and a coke. I then went to get my other adult sister to have her on board with calling CPS. I´ve spoken to her once before about calling CPS and at the time we decided we can handle our sister's need to see a psychologist ourselves. At the time she was totally against it. But that was before I learned of the bed wetting, eating disorder, malnutrition. I laid it all out to her, how horrible it all is, that our little sister will surely die or have irreversible psychological and physical damage if we don´t do something now. Finally, she agreed. She was shocked, looked traumatized by this, she cried and was really silent. We agreed that the best plan is for me to take the hit and for her to pretend she knew nothing of the plan. This way when I´m disowned she still has access to the kids and is able to help them in case CPS drops the ball. Then I made the call with her there and put the call on speaker. (Where we live these things are handled through a call first). The case handler was the same person I had consulted yesterday. I carefully went through my list of complaints: 1. terrible living conditions, sleeping on the floor behind a cupboard, filth everywhere 2. severe depression, suicidal thoughts and plans 3. bed wetting at the age of 13 and since 3 yo (In my last post I mistakenly said she was 12) 4. probably hygiene issues, she has a weird smell 5. stomach pains since 3 yo 6. a bizarre eating disorder where she only eats one thing mainly and a few smaller treats every now and then 7. malnutrition - she has to make her own food, many days she eats nothing 8. fainting from malnutrition 9. homeschooling with the occasional brainwashing how terrible schools, doctors, psychologists are (they went to a weird private school for a couple of years, but there was a conflict and now they sit at home) 10. below normal educational level (sometimes she doesn´t know the simplest words or how things work) 11. very antisocial, avoids nice experiences, social activities, speaks very little, answers question with only yes/no 12. trauma from her father´s death 13. an emotionally distant mother who only belittles, yells, criticizes 14. threats of throwing her out of the house 15. the mother knows all of this because my sister tells her and she does nothing to help 16. zero medical help with any of that - no doctors for 10 year stomach pain problem, bet wetting, no psychiatric help for suicidal depression, eating disorder and not only that the mother doesn´t recognize there is a problem whatsoever. She tells her child and everyone else that she needs to get over it and the only problem she has is that she doesn´t have her own room ""booohooo"" The caseworker was very alarmed naturally and did confirm that all my worries are legitimate and this child is likely in immediate danger due to malnutrition. She carefully listed all my concerns in the report: 1. the CPS visit must be unannounced or she will fix the ""room"" that is one of the only physical evidence 2. the child will not tell anything in the presence of the mother and in fact the child is taught to be scared of strangers and she might not tell anything on the first try 3. she reassured me that each case is handled individually and it´s not unusual to have a different adult family member in site to help reassure the child that she is safe to speak (if the CPS specialist sees it fit) The report was made and the case was started. I sent my adult sister to take the food to my little sister (she lives in the same house at the moment). Now comes the BUT. I don´t know if our mother has done this intentionally or what, but the kids are in a strange loophole. They live in a house in one city but are registered in our original birthplace far away. The house they live in now is actually a business real estate meaning the ""private estate"" address kind of doesn´t exist. Legally speaking. Meaning that there are two regional CPS-s that should be responsible for them in both of these areas, but that makes me worried. The original counselor (who made the report) promised me she will personally call them both to hurry up the process. 2 hours later I get a call from the CPS department from our birthplace (where the kids are legally registered in). She agreed that this child needs a team of professionals to handle her complex problems asap. She listened to all of my complaints again, was extremely alarmed, but said that because the kids are physically out of her handling area all she can do is put pressure on the local CPS to handle the case quickly. She reassured that this legal loophole happens a lot and the CPS on-site normally handles the case. God I hope it´s true. She promised she will call them right away to communicate the severity of the situation. The report states that the next CPS department will have to call me first to go over all of the dangers and concerns once again. I think that´s pretty good, this way I can go pretty far down the chain of command to let them know how bad it is. I´m waiting for that next phone call now. Legally they have to have visited the home, made an official report and a decision about how to handle things further within 10 days of the original report. Tomorrow is my little sister´s birthday, she´s telling me she doesn´t want anyone to come visit - ""It´s pointless"". I´m chatting with her in Facebook right now trying to see how I can make tomorrow ok for her. I´ll update once I have further news. Thanks again to everyone who supported me, it helps to keep the guilt and fear at bay. SMALL UPDATE: a 3rd CPS person called a few hours later. This is the regional CPS handler, I´m invited to her office tomorrow and bring the proof I have. I didn´t like her voice much, she was very straight to the point, no ""I understand"" and ""this sounds bad"" responses. I´ll present my documents to her tomorrow. Wish me luck.",
767,"I’m Lily Madwhip and There’s a Monster Wearing My Dad’s Pajamas[I’m Lily Madwhip and there’s a monster wearing my dad’s pajamas](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lillian_Madwhip/comments/e7wfcf/im_lily_madwhip_and_i_just_want_to_go_home/). “We wager you did not foresee our paths crossing again, little oracle,” says the monster. His name is Astyanax. I remember the last time I saw him. He had just gone through a door into someone’s bedroom and then worms came out of his head and then there was a dog, not a dog coming out of his head but just a dog dog in the room... and a shotgun. The dog didn’t have the shotgun, there was a man with a shotgun. It’s a long story. I barely remember most of it as it is. I’ll have to write it all down in my journal before I forget everything. “Why are you in my dad’s pajamas?” I put up my fists for a fight. They’re small fists. I’m a small person. I wish I had my knife on me. Even a butter knife would be nice. He tugs the pajama pants up because he’s so thin that they keep threatening to fall down. I don’t want to see that. Nobody would. I really hope he’s still wearing that diaper underneath. I don’t think he or anyone else from Snakebutt’s dungeon got to bathe regularly. Adults need to bathe like ten times more than kids do, because once you hit a certain age you just sweat all the time and it smells like rotten eggs. My dad is going to have a fit when he sees this guy in his pajamas. Especially since he’s full of worms. Maybe that’s all he is, just a pile of worms in a human suit. “We were freezing,” he replies, like that’s it. You just show up at someone’s door wearing their dad’s pajamas and shrug it off because you were cold. I could understand if my dad gave him the pajamas, but my dad would never give this guy his pajamas. “What did you do with my mommy and daddy? How did you even get here?” It feels like he walked off on our little group of survivors just a few hours ago. Let me think... faced hekate, got in a knife fight with the school bully, angels showed up, more angels showed up, everything fell apart, we fell through space, landed on a beach, surfers got decapitated... then a car ride home. I’m like 95% sure that the door he went through didn’t lead to my house. That one had a dog and a guy with a shotgun, and we have neither a dog nor a guy with a shotgun in ours. At least I hope we don’t have a guy with a shotgun. I wouldn’t mind the dog. Except that Astyanax tore that dog to pieces. I hope my bedroom isn’t full of dog parts. “We came to repay the life-debt we owe to you,” his mouth moves open and shut. Is it him talking or the worms inside him talking? “We did not think you would survive your encounter with the witch queen--” he pauses to spit after mentioning her, “--so we came to tell your pater and mater of your deeds and your fate.” He glances around at the empty neighborhood. “We would be curious to know what befell her.” “Why are you talking in plural?” I ask. He turns to look at me. His jaw creaks open just a little. Is he going to do his worm trick and tear me apart? Please don’t tear me apart, I just got home. “You saw what we really are. We thought it was safe to speak as we normally do in your presence. Only Lamia knew before you. After her mater twisted us into these... these *dirt-eaters*, Lamia stitched together this suit from bone and flesh with which to imprison and torture us. Imagine having your humanity stolen from you, then forced back upon you in a cruel jest just so they can enact more suffering upon you. We acted as one because-- would you have spared us if you’d seen us as we are?” I didn’t really follow everything he said. “I mean, as long as you didn’t ask me to carry them in my hands, I would save a bunch of worms.” Worms are wiggly and gross, but they make dirt good for farming. At least that’s what I’m told. They must be pretty miserable though because they always seem to commit suicide during rain showers, coming out to lay on the sidewalk and then shrivel up in the sun when the rain stops. “You are more noble than most,” he tugs up my dad’s pajamas again. “If it confuses you, we... I... can speak as you would. Your parents are tied up at the moment. They misunderstood our... my... intentions.” “What are your intentions?” I ask, “Make me freeze to death out here on my own porch after saving your wormy lives?” He still hasn’t explained how he even got here. Astyanax makes a sad face. I wonder how the worms are able to control the body. Do they tug on his brain like puppet strings? Is there a brain? Do they wiggle around under the skin and just give the appearance of emotions? Too many questions, and I’m still out here in the chilly, night air. “I’m sorry,” he says. They say. Whatever. “Please come inside and get warm.” We walk inside. My house is toasty and I’ve missed it more than I realize. I want to cry and hug the couch but that’d probably come off as weird. Upstairs is my bed. I’m ready to just go collapse in it. Somewhere, my parents are tied up too. I need to hug them as well, after untying them but maybe before untying them too. So many emotions, I don’t know what to do, so I just go limp and fall to my knees in the entryway. Astyanax steps toward me with concern. “Are you wounded?” “I’m exhausted,” I tell him. “We will fetch a pair of your father’s pajamas for you.” “I have my own pajamas.” He nods and starts toward the stairs. “No, I don’t want my pajamas either. I just want my mom and dad.” Astyanax comes back and stands near the kitchen door. I can smell coffee coming from inside. Normally I don’t like the smell of coffee, but smelling it now reminds me that I’m home. Inside the Veil, everything smelled old and musty, like a book store or under Nana’s bed. I hid there once... under Nana’s bed, not the bookstore. You can’t hide in a bookstore unless you’re a book. I almost forgot what home smells like, kind of a mix of Mom’s executive perfume and Dad’s Irish soap. And coffee of course. My room smells like a pomander. That’s this thing where you take an orange and stick cloves in it and then hang it somewhere like a little pine tree in a car. I like to make pomanders, but Mom said it’s a waste of an orange so I had to stop. The one in my room has been hanging there since I was six. All the cloves fell out and the orange is just this shriveled, little, gray lump. “We are... no, *I am*... sorry that I had to tie them up, your mater and pater,” Astyanax rubs his arms nervously, a strange tic for worms to have since they don’t have arms. “When I told them of your battle with the witch queen, they accused us... me... of abducting you. Your pater threatened us. Our first instinct was survival, but that would have been a poor showing of our gratitude, slaying your parents. So we tied them up.” I get up and lug myself over to the couch. Sweet, soft couch. I pet its arm and hug it, then flop down on the cushions and look at Astyanax. He seems confused. I knew hugging the couch would look weird. Maybe now he thinks hugging the furniture is a ritual in my house. “So you tied up my parents, then borrowed my dad’s pajamas and... what? Waited for me to return? You thought I was dead. How did you get here? How long have you been wearing my dad’s pajamas?” Time works differently in the Veil. Ohno told me that. At the time, I thought she meant that we could be gone for hours and it would only appear like minutes. Maybe it meant minutes in the Veil would be like days out here. She never bothered to clarify it. Ambrose has been in the Veil for years and he seemed to think it was still whenever he came from. Astyanax seems to go limp. His jaw hangs open and there’s darkness inside. His eyes stare off at nothing. I can see the worms inside him wiggling around in his throat. Maybe they’re having a meeting. A worm meeting. After a minute, the wriggling stops and his eyes swivel back toward me and his mouth clamps shut briefly. “Knowing your name was enough. Everything that lives and wriggles beneath the dirt is our kin. We spoke to them and through them we found you. Your home is well known among those of us who feast on the dead.” “What’s that supposed to mean?” “It took us a long time to get here. We... did things... that are best left unspoken. We would say that it took... days... to get here. And then within hours, you show up. It would seem that Clotho smiled upon us when she spun the thread that is our fates.” Something feels wrong about this. I try not to give it away to the worms with my face but I’m pretty expressive, so I think about it while studying my feet. When I first saw Astyanax, I thought he came to murder me. But he says he came to repay me for freeing him from Snakebutt’s dungeon, even though when he ran out on my book club he seemed pretty angry. He comes to my house and ties up my parents. I don’t see how this counts as payback. “So...” I wiggle my toes in my shoes. “Now that you’ve said thank you, I guess you’re gonna go find a place to live?” Astyanax makes a face like my mom did when I showed her I had learned how to mix her a rum and coke just by watching my Uncle George at every family gathering. “There is no true place for us among men anymore. If you are here, then the witch queen must be gone. With her finally brought down--” he turns and spits again. I wish he’d stop spitting on the floor in my house. “--there is no way for us to be restored. We’ve thought about it, and will likely shed this final prison and join our brethren under the dirt.” I feel bad for him... for them. I don’t know what they were or who they were before Hekate turned them into a pile of worms. What if they were another one of the many like me who she brought into the Veil to use in her weird plan to... I don’t even know what her plan was. Make me fight her to control the Veil only there’s no way to win and Samael was behind it all the entire time or something. It makes my head hurt thinking about it. “I guess this is goodbye. Thanks for not killing my parents.” He smiles. It’s a little gross-looking, because I can see things move beneath the surface of his face as he does it. I half expect a worm to poke out of his nose and in a tiny voice like somebody sucking on a party balloon say, “adios, Lily!” and then wave a tiny hat with a tiny arm. That doesn’t happen though. Instead he turns to the little table where my parents keep their car keys, opens the drawer where Dad sticks the mail he doesn’t like, and pull out Paschar. Or at least, pulls out Paschar’s totem, the doll that I’ve always known as Paschar, only at the moment it’s just a doll because Paschar the angel is somewhere in the Veil. At least I hope he is. Last time I saw him he was fighting Samael in the void before Meredith and I got dumped on a beach. “Paschar!” I almost squeal. I feel the strength return to my legs and I hop to my feet and run over to hug him. More than a couch, more than a bed, more than my dad but not my mom, I want to hug Paschar. But Astyanax holds him up over his head like Roger used to do. It’s called “keepaway” and I hate it when tall people play it with me. The wormbag puts a hand on my shoulder. “Like I said, I came to repay my debt to you.” I hop and reach out for Paschar. “Please give my my dolly!” He looks worriedly at me. “Are you mad, child? We need to destroy this!” I freeze and stare at him. “I beg your pardon?” Astyanax examines the doll in his fancy, black vest and drawn-on tie and nice slacks that my Nana made for him. He seems upset. Maybe he thought the doll was something else. “This is one of the instruments of the seraphim,” he says, “your captors and tormentors. I can sense the connection between it and the other side. Like the trail of a dove carrying messages between the living and the dead.” “No, that’s an angel totem!” “Angel, yes,” he doesn’t seem fazed by this, “another name for the same cruel beings. They toy with us like playthings. Make us fight amongst ourselves, treat us like experiments to do their whims. The worst of them is the lord of that wretched underworld we both escaped.” He means Samael. I agree with that part. Samael is super stinky. I hope he gets stuck in that void and never gets out. I don’t care what the dog angel said about him being important to things. The Veil can be his grave for all I care. The worm-man grips Paschar’s head in his other hand. He twists it, apparently thinking it would rip off, but it’s plastic and not fully attached to his neck, so it just squeaks and twists around. Roger once twisted his head completely off. Mom put it back on, but she’s never been one for toy repair, so it’s been crooked ever since. “Oh!” I cry, “Please don’t do that! His head is a sore spot!” Astyanax clutches Paschar by the torso and legs and tries to snap him in half, but his legs just bend at the sockets. He is clearly getting frustrated. “Accursed thing!” he hisses, then glares at me. “I’m freeing you from them, don’t you understand?” Nothing good ever comes to anyone who messes with Paschar. Roger threw him out a car window and seconds later he was tasting the metal of a truck grill in his face. My dad hid Paschar from me and he ended up getting stuffed in a trunk and getting put in a coma. I don’t know if the doll is cursed like a mummy’s tomb or just weird luck, but it’s happened enough that I just take it for granted now. “Mr. Zanax, Please. I don’t wanna sound like I’m threatening you, but you’re gonna have a real bad time if you don’t give me back my dolly.” His eyes bulge in their sockets and his mouth drops open. “Are you threatening us?” I throw my hands up in exasperation. “I just said I wasn’t doing that!” His jaw goes real loose and then his eyes roll up behind the lids and the top of his head flips back. I can hear this sound like someone pouring out a giant bucket of wet spaghetti. It’s the worms. “WHOA!” I yell, “Whoa! Let’s not do that!” Everything gets still for like half a minute. I know because I started counting my last seconds in my head: 1, 2, 3, and I got all the way up to 32. I count kinda slow though because I gotta think the word twenty over and over and that takes time. All I can hear is the worms in his head slithering about, maybe discussing whether to leap out and rip me to pieces. Are they having a worm mutiny? Maybe not all of them were grateful I freed them. Maybe some of them think gratitude only goes so far. I don’t think any of them are thinking about my warning, because the worms in his hands are straining to snap the plastic doll in half. I know the best they can hope for is pulling his arms and legs and head out, but I can just put that all back in once he’s gone. I hope that’s all he does. “Worm friends,” I swallow the lump in my throat. “That dolly is the totem of Paschar. He’s... uh... the watcher of Elizabeth.” I try to remember everything Paschar said to Hekate. It all seemed very important at the time. I should have paid attention. “Stewmaker of the casserole. And one of the seven potatoes.” I’m pretty sure I got everything wrong there. The top of Astyanax’s head flips back over with a nasty snap. His eyes roll back down and blink at me. “What does any of that mean?” “I have no idea. But he’s very important among the angels. And that doll is his totem. He’s put a, uh... curse on it.” The grip on Paschar loosens and he looks down at the toy. One of the legs of Paschar’s pants has ripped at the seam. Dad’s going to have to sew that back up. “A curse?” I nod and move slowly toward him, holding out my hands. “Anyone who tries to destroy it suffers terribly. Believe me. I’ve seen it happen.” He looks at me, then at the doll. “Do you trust me?” I ask, moving another step closer. I can almost feel the soft felt of Paschar’s clothes on my fingertips. Astyanax turns toward the sliding door to the backyard. He looks out at the trees and bushes and grass like something’s distracted him. After a moment, he turns back to me, his skin wriggling all over with the worms inside him. “The dirt eaters that reside on your land spoke well of you,” he says calmly. “See? They-- wait, the worms talk about me?” I stop. “The worms in my backyard talk about me? Like gossipy talk? What do they say?” He holds out Paschar to me. “They say you are a friend to us. That you have kept them well-fed.” “The worms said that?” Oh cripes, they *are* talking about all my dead pets. I can’t believe the worms are happy they get to eat all my poor babies that we buried in the backyard. That’s so wrong. This bizarre conversation is interrupted by the sound of shattering glass. It’s the sliding door to the backyard, because something super big just got thrown through it. The big thing is like a giant sack of potatoes. It hits the ground with a wet splat and what looks like one of those tumbleweeds you see in Western movies and Wile E Coyote cartoons rolls across the floor and stops between Astyanaxx and me. The tumbleweed has a face. I recognize it because I just got done taking a car trip with it and a talking dog. It’s name was Mortimer, or as I liked to think-- “SANTA!” I scream. I hear Meredith’s voice from outside. “Lily! RUN!” “Run and we’ll peel your little friend like a grape,” comes a voice, only it’s got a funny accent and sounds like “Rune and wail pale yer loddle fran look a greep.” Two dark forms step through the broken glass door. It’s the crispies, Snap and Pop. They’re still wearing the wetsuits they stripped off the surfers. One of them has Meredith under his arm like she’s a piece of luggage, only she’s kicking and slapping at him angrily and suitcases don’t do that. They don’t bite either, like she’s doing to his arm while snarling like a wild animal. He doesn’t seem to care in the least. “People don’t peel grapes!” That’s what I *want* to say, but I’m too busy staring at Mortimer’s lifeless eyes. If his head were still attached to his neck I’d just think he was sleepy. Instead I just say “banana” quietly. Because you peel bananas. Who peels grapes? Maybe headless ghouls like these two do. Snap brushes his hands off on his pants. They’re wet with blood. “We come bearing gifts,” he says, but his funny accent makes it sound more like “we comb boring gafts.” I’m frozen in fear. Jophiel said the crispies were too powerful for me to deal with and now they’re standing in my living room and I don’t even have Paschar to help me. “Who are you?!” shouts Astyanax. He’s still holding Paschar, but not trying to tear the doll apart anymore. He’s got it raised like some sort of weapon instead. “Get out of here!” Yeah, that’ll... that’ll drive them off. Snap looks around the living room. “Noise Hoose.” He looks at me. “Onokole sands her regourds.” I can almost understand him. “Give oos the tootem.” Astyanax and I look at each other. Are we having one of those moments where two people share a thought and make a plan without speaking? Because I got nothing. I’m just trying not to pee my pants. Maybe he is too. That can be a shared thought. Let’s not pee our pants. “They took my Barbie!” Meredith shrieks, “And they killed Mortimer!” Yeah, I can see that. But where’s Jophiel and the doggy? Did they get away? Did the crispies grab Meredith and Mortimer before Jophiel got back to the car? I hope the dog is okay. Snap crunches across the broken glass, stepping past the huge sack of potatoes that was Mortimer’s body. I can hear the carpet squish wetly beneath his feet, probably with Mortimer’s blood. We’re going to have to get that shampooed out. Or more likely mom will just get it all recarpeted. I mean, if we don’t all die. Someone will get it shampooed I guess. He walks up to Astyanax. “You er foother?” he asks, jabbing a thumb my way. He grins. There’s blood on his teeth. It’s probably the surfer’s blood. He puts his other hand out. “Hond it oover.” Astyanax casts me one last look, then turns and glares at him. “Over our dead bodies.” Snap smirks. “Far enoof. Wanna see wot I kin do wit me had?” Astyanax lowers his chin. “Want to see what I can do with mine?” Snap reaches up to grab Astynax by the neck. I’ve seen him do it before, twisting a surfer’s head right off his body so he could wear it like a hat. The head he’s wearing right now, in fact. Because Snap doesn’t have a head of his own. He’s got a hand where his head should be. But Astyanax’s head doesn’t twist off like he planned. Instead, the top of it flops back on the jaw like a hinge. Snap looks genuinely surprised by this. He gets three and a half words out. “Wot the bloody f--” And then a thick tentacle shoots up out of Astynax’s neck. Not a tentacle... worms. Worms wrapped around each other so tightly they look like muscle. They glisten in the moonlight coming from outside, reflected off the broken glass all over the floor. The wormacle pops straight up out of the lower half of Astyanax’s head like one of those stalagmites you see in a cave. Not to be confused with stalactites which are just stalagmites that prefer the ceiling to the floor. C for ceiling, G for ground. That’s how I was taught to remember. The massive worm stalagmite arcs down at the top like a fountain of water and plunges into the top of Snap’s head with a sick cracking sound If it had been Snap’s head, he’d probably be dead. But it’s not, so instead the head just comes right off, sliding down the front of his wetsuit, revealing the weird, blackened hand beneath it, all covered with gross stuff. Pop drops Meredith to the floor like a sack of garbage and drops to his hands and knees behind the couch, probably poised like a tiger about to pounce. A second later he shoots across the room like a missile --a tiger missile I guess-- minus the head he was wearing as a disguise... the hand in its place clenched up like a fat fist. He hits Astyanax like a battering ram. Astyanax flies backward and tumbles over the coat rack by the door to the entryway. His body crumples into a pile while the worms inside him flail out of his neck like an army of angry spaghetti noodles. I can see them latching onto the crispies, wrapping around them like slimy bandages. And just when I think it couldn’t get weirder, that’s when the dog bounds into the room through the broken glass door. I mean, a dog coming inside isn’t weird, but it feels so out of place with the head-hands and the worms and all the blood that it seems kind of surreal to see it running in. It trots over to me and rubs against my leg. I pet it numbly. “Lily!” It’s Jophiel. “Take the collar!” I stare at the two crispies writhing on the floor covered in worms that seem to be trying to squeeze them to death. They tear the little, wriggling bodies by the tens or hundreds, but more just keep coming out of Astynax. Why me? Why’s it always gotta be me? He could have had Meredith take the collar. He could have had anyone take the collar. Why’s it gotta be me? Always me. Always Lily. I hear Paschar in my head. “Lily, take the collar.” He’s home. It’s such a relief to hear his voice, it just makes all the horrors going on across the room seem to fade away. I reach down and unhook the dog’s collar. Almost immediately, everything around me looks brighter, clearer, more colorful. It’s night still, but I can see in the dark as if it’s the sunniest day of Summer. The glass on the floor glitters like diamonds. Even Mortimer --poor Mortimer-- looks less like a sack of potatoes and more like one of those paintings they have in the Museum of Fine Art in Boston. It’s like he was painted with acrylics. Everything is awash in color. The worms are a beautiful pink. The red of Mortimer’s blood is so vibrant it makes me want to cry. “Take the others,” says Paschar. My legs don’t want to move, so instead I reach out with my hand and my mind. I can’t see them, but I sense them... two angels, compacted into plastic and molded into the shape of dolls. They feel me calling to them and come to me, flying across the room from their individual locations and snapping into my hand like a pair of magnets. The world is alive. I can see the nasty, shriveled hearts beating in the crispies’ chests. I can hear the furious beating of ten thousand little worm hearts. I feel the heartbeat of the doggy at my side, and my friend Meredith lying behind the couch. Upstairs in their bedroom, my mom and dad’s hearts are beating fast, frightened by the noises from downstairs. I can even see the last rhythm of Mortimer’s heart in his chest. He has already been judged. “The time of judgment has come.” I can hear myself speaking, but it’s not me. At least, I don’t think I’m saying this. It’s my voice, but I’m busy thinking about how it’s not me even as I’m speaking. It feels like my hair is on fire. Maybe it is. I hope I’m not burning the whole house down. It’s like I’m outside my body, watching, but I’m not, I’m trapped behind my eyes. As if in response, the piles of still-living worms squirm away from the two silently struggling Dullahan. I don’t know why I remember that word now. That’s what they are. Dullahan. Ugly servants of death. Snap flounders on the floor, the hand coming out of his neck grabs the decapitated surfer’s head and puts it back on, then turns and looks at me, half its face covered in blood from the wound the worms made. “Woe unto you, Cian and Donnacha,” I say. That’s their names. I know their names. My voice sounds like thunder. My own heart feels like its going to explode in my chest. It hurts. My whole body is on fire. I raise my arms. “NO!” roars Donnacha. “Behold his wrath,” I whisper. [And then the world goes completely silent, even as the ceiling over our heads disintegrates and the entire room is filled with a pillar of white-hot fire that floods all my senses, blinding me](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lillian_Madwhip/comments/epjvs3/im_lily_madwhip_and_you_can_keep_this/).",
768,"Bakugou isn't as bad as you think he isRight first off, this is only an opinion and i'm not claiming that your depiction of Bakugo is wrong it's just that I like breaking conventions and exploring different views. In no means do I think i'm right; i'm just expressing my opinion. This is gonna be a long one. Firstly, Bakugo is initially portrayed as an arrogant and belligerent at the beginning of the series, which is clearly evident through his aggressive and cynical remarks towards Midoriya about his lack of a quirk and how he should commit suicide and get a quirk in his next life. Obviously this kind of language is unacceptable but it effectively shows that he views himself as superior amongst his peers; almost picturing himself as a king and his subjects. This superiority complex is then challenged by this slime villain when he tries to take him 1 on 1 and eventually gets kidnapped and taken as a hostage. When Midoriya ineffectively tries to help save him, Midoriya's act of compassion not only damaged Bakugo's pride and superiority complex, but it inevitably helped him realise that he isn't invincible and his arrogance is what got him into that situation and is effectively what makes him a flawed character. This realisation is portrayed when he goes to Midoriya in the aftermath of the attack to say thank you, although he does it in his neanderthal like attitude. He also says that he'll improve and get better so that he won't ever have to experience that kind of event ever again.This whole scene acts as a first step into the right direction of his redemption (although a very small step). His views are then chellenged again in his first fight against Deku. Within this fight, his only intention is to completely annihilate Deku and assert himself as the best among Class 1-A. However he is defeated by Deku using One for All and he himself is annihilated. This defeat further cracks his superiority complex as he was just defeated by a weak and previously quirkless nobody who only who he views as inferior When the two of them finally meet once again he completely acknowledges Deku's win and reinforces that he will get stronger when they next fight. His tears of frustration during this scene convey that he isn't just an asshole, but a person who has accepted his flaws and weaknesses and is resolved to improve as a hero; but not as an individual. During the sports festival, his exasperation over his win clearly shows that he feels that his victory wasn't absolute as Todoroki didn't fight at full force to the end. It could also show how he feels that Todoroki didn't give Bakugo the respect that he should of earned as Todoroki went full force with Midoriya but not with Bakugo. Again this whole fight deepened the crack in his pride. Perhaps his frustration could outline his sense of honour and dignity as a fighter and individual as he refuses to accept his win and continues to be annoyed by it after the festival. Although he still remains as one of the worst friends a person can possibly get, his role in the series as a rival is absolutely superb (in my opinion) because he allows Midoriya to develop and become a more mature individual and hero. His second fight with Deku (the one where all might shows up) not only allowed him to vent his guilt and annoyance, but also reveals his more vulnerable and emotional side. His guilt for causing All might's early retirement evidently shows that he isn't just a prick but also humane as it depicts that he is at least considerate of his actions and the severity of the situation. Meanwhile, although Midoriya believes that this fight is useless, he unconsciously reveals his desire to win, which he believes that Bakugou embodies. This in turn highlights that the only thing that Midoriya desires and respects about Bakugo is his unwavering resolve to always win. When Deku is asked by Mirio what kind of hero we wants to be, he replies "" I want to save everyone with smile no matter--. I want to be strong enough so that no one will worry about me. To always win. Too always save everyone. I want to be the greatest hero"". His answer to Mirio's question outlines that the he has taken into account his tribulations and experiences like his battle with Bakugou to evolve his meaning and depiction of what a true hero is. Therefore, Bakugo isn't an a terrible rival as without his rivalry with Deku, Deku would not be able to develop as a character and hero. In the Remedial Licence arc, he comes across a child who acts similarly to how Bakugo did at the beginning of the series, arrogant and naive. Unexpectedely, Bakugo doesn't try to measure his power to the child's but ""calmly"" states: https://preview.redd.it/8bcqys6fjxd41.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb81eaaedc6d59e3e49904ec3d1422ac7bb4b1be At this point in the manga, his words ""from the heart"" distinctly highlight his growth and character development during his time at UA. He has learnt from his failures and mistakes and has truly matured into not only a true hero,but also a member of society as well. Eventually, his wisdom has made an impact into the lives of the children and they'll finally grow up into some decent people one day; perhaps even heroes. Within this post i'm not trying to say that he is forgiven nor redeemed for his actions but just wanted to make a point that at his core, he isn't all bad. But that doesn't mean that he isn't all perfect. Personally, he still has a ways to go until he reaches the point of being a true hero Like All Might. In fact there is an extremely good reddit post that outlines his many flaws which I shall link down here.: [https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/evp03q/bakugou\_is\_an\_awful\_rival\_and\_a\_worse\_friend/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/evp03q/bakugou_is_an_awful_rival_and_a_worse_friend/) This post is in no way trying to attack the post above but just trying to give another view on such an interesting character. Thank you for reading to the end and I hope you have an amazing day",
769,"Severe abuse broke me, but I am recoveringMy father is a sober man, but for all intents and purposes he was always drunk on his ego. A rampant narcissist and borderline psychopath, my father is responsible for most of my suffering in life. Certainly, I take responsibility for my fair share of personal shortcomings, but we live in a world of cause and effect relationships. The roots of child abuse run deep, and they form a tangled web in my psyche that has led to me being a homeless recovering addict with a colorful spectrum of mental health problems. One of my first memories is being thrown across the room when I was four. I don’t remember why I was tossed like a ragdoll, but I distinctly remember sipping my juice box while my mom talked with the police officer at the front door. I feel obligated to share the strength of this memory, because my father would later deny these events ever happened. Gas-lighting is common for him - he routinely chooses his ego over family, which was apparent as I tried to bridge the gap between us on my spiral down to the streets.I’ve decided to go no contact with him after recent outreach attempts have returned the same condescending, compassionless responses. When I asked for fatherly advice while feeling desperate and suicidal, he had little more to say than “don’t kill yourself,” and “get your shit together.” It is that lack of loving care that I desperately wanted my whole life, without ever realizing that it was his approval I needed more than anything. Instead, I lived for vengeance, as I saw my father as the personification of pure evil. In the beginning stages of my schizoaffective symptoms (though I wouldn’t know anything was wrong until later), I created and believed a whole mythology of how I was a god who was tormented by my deity of a father for being imperfect - a perfect mirror to what was going on in my real life. After my mother died when I was nine, I was left with my father who began dating again. I remember my life was divided into sagas, where each new person he brought into my life waxed and waned, as he could only keep up the appearance of being a saintly widower caring for his son/daughter (I’m mtf trans but didn’t know until much later in life) for so long. His mood would reflect the state of his relationships, and his abuse, both physical and emotional, would ramp up to extreme levels when things weren’t going right for him. For instance, when I was ten, his second major relationship was starting to turn rocky. During this time, the water line burst in our basement. While he was hauling the water up, he asked if I had done my homework. As it was a Saturday, I hadn’t. I had no idea why he asked outside of giving him an excuse to pummel me. You see, after berating me for being lazy, he got furious with me and soon we were on the floor. He was over me, smashing my head into the linoleum of the kitchen floor. This happened several times as afterwards I had to help get the door for him while doing my homework. Naturally, my hands were shaking and I slammed the door open trying to be as efficient as he wanted me to do. Soon after all the water was drained, his girlfriend called and he was calm again. We went out to dinner with her sons that night like nothing ever happened. When I was eleven, his future ex-wife left for a darts tournament. I suspect something was amiss around this time, because my father was in a really sour mood. I tried to avoid him by playing video games, but this just pissed him off more. During this time, I eventually forgot to take out the trash from the kitchen, which led to him dragging my by the leg to my room, punching it and making me think he was going to break it. He didn’t, but he picked me up, shook me, and began smashing my head into the back of my door, breaking that instead. After throwing me to the ground and telling me to lay there like a dog, he proceeded to clear out my shelves - which contained everything my mom had ever made me - in two rabid sweeps of him arms. I laid there, completely frozen in shock, as he cleaned up the mess he made. When he finished and was about to go to the dump, he made me stand. I would continue standing perfectly still for the remainder of the day until I passed out some 8-10 hours later. During this time, he would come to me and ask if I had anything to say. I tried coming up with an apology for being selfish and not thinking of his needs during this time, but nothing I said was good enough. Near the end of the day, he would begin lecturing me and insinuate I was a horrible human being for choosing to play video games when my mom was close to death. That sort of psychological torture was common. In high school, I would become bulimic because I was not good enough for him in track, despite owning half of our school’s record board and competing on a national level. There was a time when I was practicing three times a day, once in the morning, and then twice back to back in the evening. He was living vicariously through me, as self-evident by the fact that he still has all the rewards I earned plastered on the walls of his living room. When I failed, he failed, and that was not tolerated. He wasn’t mad, he was livid, a fact he repeated many times as he shit in my soul for nights at a time. On top of this, everything I did was criticized and I was belittled for the smallest things. Once I cut my hair the way I wanted, which really wasn’t that different than how it was before, and I didn’t hear the end of it for weeks. He still stalks me on social media, but while I still lived in his house, most anything I posted was met with a sarcastic comment or at least something letting me know he was watching everything I was doing. That sort of hyper-obsessive and vile watching eye is what led to me living in denial of my identity for so long. In fact, for the longest time, It has felt like I had a dead limb attached to my psyche, there but unable to be interacted with. Now, it feels like my masculine and feminine energies are like oil and water. I’m still healing and mending who I am, so eventually this may change, but right now I’m stuck in a nonbinary state that is ever-changing. Additionally, I live in a slipstream of synchronicities. I like to say being schizoaffective is like being bipolar, but the aliens are constantly abducting me in order to protect me from the CIA, who is creating a reality TV show around my life. Every day it feels like the universe is sending me messages, most of which revolve around me not being good enough and that I need to improve. It’s not hard to see how my psyche was molded over time to perpetually trap me in a reality built of the quicksands of negative self-image. Still, I’m in an infinitely better place than where I once was. I’ve been sober for a few months now, and while there are moments of weakness where I feel I may use again, I have a greater sense of a mission on this planet that is guiding me toward brighter futures. I may be homeless, but the experiences I’ve had on the streets have been the most radically transformative of my life. I feel infinitely more independent than I once was. My core philosophy is that free will is a skill - if we walk down a new road every day eventually we will be able to navigate to any destination. If we are regularly pushing our boundaries, we cannot help but step outside our comfort zone and expand as a person. Having no stability has forced me to recondition myself, opening new doors and avenues for myself moving forward. I’m so much more calm and present than I once was. Even though my emotions are still a roller coaster, it feels more like a kids ride now, and at the very least I have stopped self-harming since being on this new concoction of medications. I am hopeful for the future. More importantly, I am grateful for the present. Being grateful changes everything in our perspective; it is like wearing glasses to see the world through a different lens. I may have traveled through some harsh roads growing up, but if I didn’t I would not be who I am right now. Every experience is a blessing, and we are all here to enjoy the ride of our lives. The highs would be meaningless without the lows, and there are so many small moments of joy to be found in every day. There is only up from here, and I want to bring some of the light I have found into others’ lives. I hope you found something meaningful in my story, and I hope you have many bright days ahead of you.",
770,"I had an epiphany. I made connections between trauma and behaviour. TW: Child abuse inc sexual - No specifics. (Long)&#x200B; A bit of background. I'm a 41 year old woman, who has CPTSD due to repeated traumatic events and being abused through most of my childhood. (11-16 I could never claim I was abused during those years, but it was far from ideal and I it was a time of 0 support or interest from my parent) Despite being diagnosed almost 10 years ago and living with serious depression and suicidal tendencies since childhood, I have somehow managed to miss making what are, to me now, obvious connections. I am not currently in any treatment, I noped out of the treatment I finally sought, 10 years ago, when I wasn't getting any relief or benefit, or **anything** at all useful - Not having anything to compare it against, I just figured any treatment, including the much lauded 'get it off your chest' schtick couldn't fix it, and I'd have to keep on keeping on as I had been. Two days ago, after having a really hard few weeks with flashbacks, getting stuck in mental loops trying to process things and spiraling towards one of my 'can't move forward cos I'm stuck with my brain keeping me in the past' er, phases(?) I finally just started telling my husband the crap that was in my head, as it came. A pure stream of consciousness. He always knew I had a rough childhood and over the years I have mentioned to him a couple of the incidents that occurred. I left out details that were uncomfortable for me to discuss and I never could be honest and open about the extent of the trauma, or the effect it has had on my life since. Giving no details other than 1)It didn't occur at home 2)it didn't involve anyone in my family and 3)it was more than once I told my husband about my being sexually abused. Something I have told no one and can barely cope to acknowledge to myself. I have never ever openly talked in any meaningful way to anyone about my childhood and issues until two days ago. And holy guacamole, after so many years of solo struggle, I had NO idea what a difference that could make for me. Suddenly as I'm talking I started to understand a couple of things. 1)My depression and my suicidal tendencies are not a separate thing about me. They are actually a result of being messed up at such a young age. I've had these tendencies and battled them since the age of 10. I always knew that my life traumas **at that time** played a part to how I felt **at that time** but for some reason, I always felt it was separate, like that's just who I was, a depressed child who grew into a depressed adult, the other stuff was just things that had happened, there was no real connection, they just made the depression and stuff harder to cope with when I got into a depressive funk. 2)There are 3 things I did, between the ages of 5 and 6 that I always knew were pretty W in the actual F, especially because of my age. Aged 5 - I'm playing outside with my neighbour - Twin girls I knew come skipping over, it's their 6th birthday and they've got new dresses on and their hair is all prettied up and they're bragging about their dresses and presents and the party they're having later and how awesome their pony tails look - And how they're 6 before me and my friend, so we suck etc.. eh, typical bratty kid behavior. And I felt rage. I decided to get one of those little nets you get at the end of cheap bamboo fish nets poles and fill it up with berries that grew nearby. My plan, was to honest to goodness kill them, I had been told these berries were poisonous; you could die, don't eat them. I picked some, and took the net over to them and offered them as birthday present. And I happily went back to playing with my neighbour, **knowing they'd die** when they ate them, and **that would teach them** to feel smug about their hair and birthday, and that thought made me feel content. I must stress again, I was 5 effing years old. What the hell. Aged 5-6 (it's fuzzy) - I took chalk and drew sexual body parts on a neighbour's door, I drew lots of them, I wrote the word ""tits"" on the door repeatedly and over the concrete outside their front door I drew numerous pairs of breasts and wrote the word 'tits' over and over and ran off. I have no idea of any reasoning behind my doing this at the time and I do not recall if I had a conscious motivation behind it, I just have always known that was a what the hell thing for a child of that age to do. Aged 6 - Assigned seating at school and I'm stuck next to boy and I can't cope. I hate it, I hate him and I'm going to show him how much I hate him. I would surreptitiously stab his leg with the end of my pencil. I felt again, a rage about this typical childhood situation and decided that I **needed** to make him actually suffer - So I started to purposely sharpen my pencil specifically to inflict more pain! That was my intent, I **wanted** to do that. Jesus. This poor kid would sob silently while I did this and I can't tell you how many years it took to get past the guilt I felt as an adult for what I put him through. Again, I was a young child. What the bleep. My point to rambling on and giving details to those stories is because context and I've known those 3 incidents were way outside the normal realm of 5-6 year old shenanigans, but like the depression I NEVER put two and two together that they were actually things I did because I was suffering some significant abuse. Seriously not one damn time in 35 years did it click that I drew those things on that door because that's where the sexual abuse I was subjected to happened. **NOT ONE DAMN TIME** did I make that connection and that's baffling to me now that I have finally joined the very obvious dots. I'm starting to make associations that are so obvious it's not funny and yet, until I actually just blurted everything I was processing at that time out, I never could make the connections. And once I did, it was like a light went on, I realised I could actually begin to work through some of the incidents by FINALLY understanding their effects **actually did affect me.** They actually did shape me, dictate the direction I take things. I've always had this idea that they were simply things that happened and I completely separately behaved and developed and made decisions I'd have made anyway. In the same way I always saw the depression I started to experience as a 'me' thing separate from the abuse thing. Internal me is me, I 'control' that. The abuse and situations I was in come from outside of me and while damaging me and making coping tough, they are not relevant at all in who I was and who I became and that is so obviously ridiculous I've no idea how my brain did those gymnastics. I now know I can **finally start** to sort through the issues I have with the life choices I have made, because I finally am able to come to terms with the fact I was always a product of the abuse, it absolutely affected my reasoning, motivations and all that rest of it. Developing as a child in those circumstances, being so damaged as I grew up and never receiving help or being able to get any of the crap out in all these years, yeah, Squirrel, that's gonna have an effect you goon. Holy mackerel! So dang obvious to me now. Wow. If you're still here, bless your soul for sticking through my ramblings, but I was honestly wondering if anyone else ever had a similar experience or realistation? Anyone else come to point where you can see something clearly and you can't fathom how you ever didn't? N.B - Thankfully I didn't develop any further psychopathic tendencies - and have always known those three incidents were not normal. Just wanted to throw that out there!",
771,"A talk I wrote a few years ago for a friend's open mic here in the Deep SouthOne time, I saw this inspirational quote on the internet. {That sentence alone describes my Mom’s entire home design philosophy.} The one I saw was: **“Be the person you needed when you were younger.""** In terms of phrases that might end up on an upcycled pallet board, this shit was **created in a lab**. I looked it up and a writer named Ayesha Siddiqi wrote that on Twitter. Here’s a fun science fact: this sentence was cross-stitched *within a single second* of Ms. Siddiqi pressing “Submit” and has torn through Pinterest and Etsy like syphilis through Victorian London. I actually do find this quote to be very inspiring. You see, when I was younger, I went through an Earth-shattering change in my life: I lost my faith. Not just any faith you see, nothing ***casual*** like that ***liberal*** preacher Billy Graham used to peddle. No sir, we were down home, God-fearing, suit-wearing, children-beating, sex-shaming, gay-bashing, Disney-boycotting Christians and we were damn proud of it too. I mean dang. Dang proud of it. From the time I was born until the age of 20 I went to church, school and college on the same campus. I was at this place 6 days a week MINIMUM and oftentimes the full 7. We had Bible class and a Chapel service **IN SCHOOL**. I learned Creationism in science class. I walked suburban streets as a child, knocking door to door to try to lead lost souls to the Lord. Imagine just getting home from a long day at the office and as you’re getting out of your car, a teenager in a poorly fitting dress shirt that looks like a picnic table walks up to you and opens his sales pitch with “If you were to die tonight, do you know if you’d go to Heaven?” That’s right, making people face their own mortality and the dread of an uncertain afterlife was ***MY OPENER***. We had a very specific answer that the person needed to say which was, basically, that they went to my church or one very much like it. Anything else was insufficient and the person had to be converted. I remember one time, **AS A CHILD**, I looked a **GROWN ASS WOMAN** in her face and told her that being a lifelong Catholic meant she wasn’t going to Heaven because Catholics don’t believe in Jesus the right way. I once walked the beaches of Daytona Beach during Spring Break in 95 degree weather in **PANTS** trying to quote the Bible to hungover college students while trying to avoid broken glass and used needles. That’s how I spent my Spring Break. My family was a pillar of the church, volunteering at several levels of service for most of their lives. I was the star child. The favorite. The goodest of good boys. The kind of kid you want to bully. Just...***insufferable***. And also, I was very sick. Invisible, but all too real. I had several undiagnosed mental health disorders. I started cutting myself in 5th grade and I’ve written more suicide notes than I have college papers. The people in my life didn’t believe in therapy much, we were more into counseling. Counseling is like therapy where the judgment free zone is replaced by judgment that has specific chapters and verses and where the prescription is always prayer. My sickness manifested in a number of ways that were viewed as positive by those around me. I was incredibly anxious and paranoid because I thought the **CREATOR** of the **UNIVERSE** (multiverse if you believed comic books) observed everything I ever said or did and was going to list all my sins one by one when I died. So I tried to behave myself with the fear of someone who thinks God is watching them take a shower every night. I took the idea that I could telepathically communicate with God silently to its logical conclusion and thought that God could communicate back. Everyone told me that the still, small voice in my head was God. So when he told constantly told me to kill myself, I assumed it was punishment for masturbating or thinking hateful thoughts about my alcoholic father. I set out to do good, to try and be as perfect as possible to make up for all my sins; all the while knowing that “all our righteousness is but filthy rags” and I could never be good enough no matter what I did. Imagine then that someone that you look up to (let’s say your pastor who is spiritual father figure you don’t have at home as a totally random example), let’s say that person comes up to you and tells you that the **GOD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH** had spoken to him personally about your future. God Himself said that you shouldn’t follow your lifelong dream of making video games because that would be a waste of the potential God gave you. Instead, you should sacrifice the life you could’ve had and replace it with one of selfless, soul-crushing, lifelong service (and likely a good deal of poverty) by becoming a pastor! If that doesn’t get the God voice in your head to shut up, NOTHING WILL. **[Spoiler: it turns out nothing actually will, but you can’t blame me for thinking going into ministry would do the trick.]** I’ll skip the grisly details, but I’ll share a small vignette of what I found in Bible College. One day, I was in a class that all the men had to take, no matter their degree track. The women had a mirror class to this one. It was ***exactly*** as sexist as you’re imagining. This class was specifically geared to preparing men to be **Men of God**™ and the topics ranged from practical “this is how to preach a funeral” to the more ... politically charged topics like Christian Education. I was told that the liberal media like PBS and Sesame Street poisoned children’s minds. Their goal was to make them believe “Ethical” positions that opposed the Christian worldview their parents were trying to raise them in. Evil concepts like ***EQUALITY*** and ***TOLERANCE***. If I were to distill my entire Bible College experience, it would be a quote from my Junior High principal who was teaching us about the importance of educating children in homeschool or Christian School: “Someone is going to brainwash your kids, it might as well be you.” I knew this man. He lived one street over from me. I had known him and his children my entire life. I had been to his house for birthday parties.He was instrumental in my education and now was telling me that my whole life I’d been brainwashed. On purpose. And now he wanted me to go do it to other children. The worst part is how loud the round of “AMEN”s were. The majority of those men are in church leadership at this very moment. Doubts had begun to take root long before that, but I believe that day was a turning point. My exit from my faith was gradual, but is marked with sharp spikes of life-changing decisions. Dropping out of Bible College was one. Leaving my church was another. Admitting that I didn’t believe in God anymore was, ironically, the easiest one of them all. I don’t know what everyone’s religious experience is like. I didn’t find out til I was 23 that there were Cool Christians who drank beer and didn’t hate gay people and watched South Park. I have to imagine that it’s still hard to leave your church, no matter how Cool they are. A struggle is a struggle. But I also don’t think everyone understands what leaving a faith like mine is like. You lose **everything**. Everything you think you’ll lose: most of your friends, family, your home sometimes. And everything you didn’t know you could lose: * a sense of security * a purpose in life * basis for human morality * the assurance that there is an afterlife and you’ll be in the good neighborhood * the constant psychic connection with the Creator of the Multiverse who cares about your specific problems * the desire to listen to DC Talk * your identity A church is, first and foremost, a community. I had hundreds of people that knew me my whole life, that would help me without question, that would bring over under-seasoned casseroles when there was a birth or death. They were people who cared for you without being friends with you simply because you both sang off key hymns in close proximity to each other every week. I took that for granted my whole life until I didn’t have it and I have NEVER managed to replace it. Some people are not given the choice or the time to consider the consequences of leaving before they break away. I stared all of that in the face and decided to leave anyway. Before you go thinking that’s a brag, that wasn’t brave of me, that was stupid. My life became ****exponentially**** more difficult. I loved my family and the thought of disappointing them nearly killed me...literally. How could I abandon everything I’ve ever known and find my way in a world that had been demonized since I was born? This is where that quote from the beginning comes in. 10 years ago I emerged from a cave and found a vast world that was as wonderful as it was terrifying. I didn’t have anyone to look up to during this time. No one that had blazed the trail that could tell me what comes next. Not that there weren’t folks out there, mind you. I just didn’t know where to look. The exile from a self-contained group like mine is intended to throw you off balance. You were told the world was a horrifying cesspool of sin, and when you were sheltered, it can sure seem like that. There is a cycle in the churches I come from. Children are raised as sheltered as possible, having very little knowledge of the world outside. Hell, they’d outright lie to you. Marijuana can kill you! Having premarital sex once will give you AIDS! Voting for a Democrat will send you to a hell so hot that **SATAN HIMSELF** feels bad for you! Eventually if these children try to rebel or leave the church, they are released into the wild with no survival skills. In fact, negative survival skills. They have a surplus of naivete and that is fully intentional. The almost inevitable result is that life roughs these kids up. There is no one **ON EARTH** that parties harder than a Pastor’s Kid living with 6 other people in a single wide trailer free from his Dad’s regular belt n’ Bible sessions. You end up with alcoholics, addicts, unplanned pregnancies, all the result of abstinence-only education and a refusal to even prepare your children to drink and fuck responsibly because that would be **COMPLICITY**. So these roughed up kids come crawling back like the Prodigal Son (because this story is older than the book it was written in) and convert into the staunchest defenders of the Faith. They took their sabbatical into the world and had every bad thing they ever heard confirmed by personal experience, no further input necessary. Morality is absolute and binary and there is no room for gray or gradients of any kind. They rely on this cycle. It is what perpetuates the whole institution. It is a machine that makes new, fervent, lifelong Christians and if you don’t fit into the machine, you are crushed. Right now, there are thousands of queer children and adults hiding and hating and hurting themselves for being who they are. There are children that are beaten and abused in the name of respect and love. There are powerful men who rape children and there are dozens of people behind that man (normal people just like the ones you know) that will hide his crimes to protect the name of God, no matter how many molested children they break. He’s **doing God’s work** after all. **There is nothing more dangerous in this world than a person who does an evil thing with the absolute certainty that they are doing a good thing.** When I left, one of the toughest thoughts to wrestle with was that I didn’t have a definitive basis of truth and morality. No Bible, no 2,000 year old Church, no mediocre Science Fiction novels or Tom Cruise. Nothing. One of the deepest barbs I had to pull out was the belief that I was incapable of setting my own values. My own morals and ethics and purpose were spoon fed to me constantly by godly people who had the Only Truth in the Whole World. I’m over all that now. I’m a 30mumble year old man and I’ve realized that I’m as qualified as anyone to decide what is right and wrong. If you disagree with what I decide, great! The best ideas get better with discussion and learning with an open mind and there are some Biblical laws that would benefit from that kind of examination. I feel like I have to use my experiences to reach out to those who are doubting and those who have been damaged by the faithful. I’m not interested in tearing down religion, but if you can’t practice your religion and adhere to basic goddamned respect for other people, your religion is immoral. Your moral authority is bankrupt and actively harmful and you are incompatible with anything resembling a functioning society. There’s too many folks suffering. I’m happy for those that find the exvangelical movement or a support group, but my heart aches for those who were like Young Me that feel alone or paralyzed or suffer from self-hatred. I mourn for those who took the route of suicide rather than face any more of the hell they were living in. If you’re one of these folks, let me tell you right now: there is nothing **inherently** wrong with you. Not a thing. You’re not broken. You don’t need saving. You’re a person and you’ll make mistakes and you’ll do good and you’ll have problems and you’ll bring joy and you’ll cause pain and you’ll be a beautiful mess start to finish. But who you are, who you love; none of that is wrong. Anyone who tells you otherwise is wrong, full stop. I once planned to dedicate my life to serve congregations of broken people looking for an answer to all their problems. Now, I’d like to do the same thing except I admit here and now that I have no answers. I only have my ears to listen, my arms to hug, and my mouth to say “join the club, you blasphemous apostate.”",
772,"My ghosthunting show was canceled before the first episode could air.All the tapes have been destroyed by the director. The network has scrubbed all mention and hype of my show from the internet. My Facebook page is gone. Twitter erased. I guess I should be lucky they aren't trying to erase me too. Either way, what happened will only live on in my words now. Everyone else seems content to pretend nothing occurred. But I can't get it out of my mind. I feel almost compelled to talk about it, so here I am. To be truthful, I am an actor first and foremost. I've always believed in the supernatural and done a lot of personal research but I'm no expert. Still, I was happy to play the part of an expert ghosthunter on TV. The format was simple. I would visit a haunted home owned and lived in by regular people. I mainly just interviewed them and then gave them a solution or performed an exorcism depending on what we thought the problem was. We put the word out on social media that we wanted to hear from anyone who suspected they currently lived in a haunted house. Out of 1,230 promising candidates, the producers came up with a list of 40 families to visit. From them, we were hoping to get enough footage to fill 13 episodes for our first season. All of the homeowners provided enough information beforehand that I shouldn't have to ask any questions I didn't already know the answer to. And research aides had gone through it all so I could give realistic solutions to their problems. We even hired a real priest to help craft our exorcism rites. Ironically, it was the most legit television program I had ever worked in. Certainly, the homeowners thought it all real. We had visited 6 families without any problems. I ended up using the strongest exorcism rites for most of the homes. Not because we were worried about what might be in their homes, it was just good TV. In fact, there was no sign of paranormal activity while I visited but the cameramen stayed behind to get a lot of B-roll that post production could work their magic with. The families themselves were pleasant and very ordinary. Exactly what we wanted. Until we went to visit the 7th family. The Conley family. Ward and Dana Conley lived with their infant daughter, Angela, in Tallahassee, Florida. Ward was the one to first contact us but he and his wife both supplied a detailed history of their time living together. I read all the material the night before going to their house and I was fascinated with what I found. At first glance, their story was pretty basic. They had lived in the home for just three years without incident but things changed when Angela came into their lives. Ever since, there had been books falling out of bookcases, lights flickering, TV channels changing, relatively harmless stuff like that. All I planned on doing was filming the interview and using the most basic ghost banishing technique of a firm reprimand. Simply telling a minor nuisance of a ghost to ""Leave this place and never return!"" is allegedly effective. We figured having a breather episode would help the series as a whole. However, my plans changed when I looked at the photos my research aides had provided. Dana Conley was, without exaggeration, the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. I will not do her features any justice by attempting to describe them in any great detail. Just know that she surely turned the heads of everyone she passed by. By comparison, Ward Conley was a stain on humanity. Not that I would fare any better being compared to Dana's looks, but I genuinely was confused as to how such a plain man managed to attract such an enviable mate. Like a man possessed, I went back through every scrap of information I had received about this family for answers. I knew his job and because of the neighborhood they lived in, I knew Dana couldn't have been with him for the money. After another hour of rereading their bios, I finally decided to just ask them more about their relationship when I saw them in person. Either way, I resolved to get answers but I needed a break. I started up my research on mythological creatures again and ended up sleeping in my armchair with about 15 Wikipedia tabs open on my laptop. Despite the unexpectedly late night, I was eager to start the next day and practically dragged my director to the airport. We met the camera crew in Florida and made a beeline to the Conley home. When Dana opened the door, I found myself speechless. Her picture had not prepared me for how utterly gorgeous she was in real life. After letting my director introduce me, I had recovered just enough to stammer a meek hello. I was actually worried about how I'd get through the interview but it turned out that I would have to do most of the talking with Ward as Dana soon busied herself with attending to their daughter. Ward explained his theory, that the ghost of his Aunt was unhappy with the birth of their daughter, having always wanted a nephew but dying before Ward had ever even met Dana. Trying to stay professional, I jumped at the chance to ask, ""How did you meet Dana?"" He told me a disappointingly normal tale about the two of them being classmates who never spoke. Then they became coworkers at a bank together. After a couple of years working together, Ward finally worked up the courage to ask her out. Dana graced us with her presence just in time to chime, ""And the rest, as they say, is history!"" Even that tired cliche sounded like the most delightful church bells in her voice. I happily took the tea and apple pie she was offering to us and the rest of the crew. It was the most delicious dessert I could remember having but I expected nothing less from Dana at this point. And yet she was stuck here with simple, average Ward. I just couldn't understand why. Ward continued to prattle on about how his slippers never seemed to be where he last remembered putting them. I tried to focus on his words but I couldn't shake the feeling there was something wrong about this whole situation. I moved on to ask more questions about Dana but Ward became uncomfortable and evasive. At the time, I wondered what he was trying to hide. My director held up the script I had memorized the night before and pointed to it while still behind the cameraman. Reluctantly, I started asking questions about his Aunt. But then Ward indirectly gave me a huge clue. He revealed that while his Aunt really did want a nephew, he had always assumed she had just been concerned Ward would die alone. I asked him if that had been a real concern and he laughed. Apparently his whole family had worried since he had remained dateless throughout his schooling. He told me that their concerns had always been unwarranted. He simply had focused on his studies intentionally. And he didn't make a big deal about his girlfriends when he did start dating. As a matter of fact, he had been dating Dana for ages before he introduced her to his family. To them, the answer to their prayers just appeared out of thin air. Something about the way he said that jogged my memory of the night before. I suddenly realized what was going on. I was convinced this was a real supernatural event before us. I had been reading about Tulpas, spirits caused by intense desire and belief. Normally it would take a great number of people believing in the same thing to make it real but if one person had an intense enough desire, it could conjure that desire out of thin air. It almost made too much sense. Dana was too good to be true. And her being here would make the veil to the spirit world weaker wherever she was. At least, that's what I read. She could inadvertently be behind the haunting. Of course, I had no idea what to do next. I let Ward do most of the talking while my own mind raced. On one hand, I could potentially prove the existence of the supernatural on camera. On the other hand, if I performed the exorcism, it would erase Dana and I could barely stand thinking about that. But then, it wasn't like Dana could ever be my own anyways. Then, Dana entered while rocking Angela in a blanket. I had forgotten about their baby. It's not like a Tulpa could conceive. Since I was back to square one, I asked Ward if we could take a break. I stood up and walked over to Dana as thought I was more interested in Angela. I directed the cameraman to get some footage of the baby. I was disappointed to see none of Dana's remarkableness in Angela. I commented that the baby obviously took after Ward and Dana gave me a wistful look but just agreed. Intrigued, I pressed her for the meaning behind the look and she finally explained, ""Oh, she's not my biological daughter."" Ward popped up with an angry look as he stammered, ""D-d-don't use that! I want that cut out of the show!"" I was angry too. Even though this meant I was right about Dana, I couldn't believe Ward could have used her like this. In hindsight, he could have used a surrogate since a Tulpa couldn't get pregnant but all I could think of at the time is he cheated on her. Impulsively, I started chanting strongest exorcism rite I knew while staring at Dana. If I couldn't have her, I would at least make sure Ward couldn't have her either. No one fully realized what I was doing so no one stopped me. The cameras rolled on. But when I finished, Dana didn't disappear. She remained before me. Clutching a now empty blanket. She screamed. I stood there like an idiot. My director and the rest of the crew just stood there confused. It took them minutes to even comprehend the child was gone. Dana sank to her knees and hugged the blanket tight. Her face contorted with pain. Tears flowed endlessly and her screams became horse howls of despair. I'll never forget the absolute agony she embodied then. I had erased something that she had brought into existence through sheer desire. Her suffering was at least as great. Ward was wailing too but soon grabbed me and yelled, ""Bring her back! Bring my daughter back!"" It wasn't until he started punching me that my crew finally intervened. They dragged me out of there, I was sent home, and that was that. All proof of the supernatural was buried and I'll never work in Hollywood again. Within 3 months, I heard that Ward and Dana had begun divorce proceedings. But he committed suicide before it became official. Dana currently resides in a mental hospital after she attempted a self-lobotomy. I've thought about rescuing her from there, but, honestly, I can't look at her the same after I've seen how ugly she looks crying. I guess she wasn't perfect after all.",

By episode 105, two of those story- and timelines have now caught up with each other, which is a major shift from and a stark contrast to the first half of the season. The storylines ran in parallel before, but now they begin and continue to merge. In my first four analyses, I examined the clues and themes that specifically connect the timelines. This time around, as the narrative structure has shifted, so does my analysis: Now I will focus on what connects the three main characters and their respective storylines -- Geralt, Yennefer and Ciri. To everyone who followed this series of analyses until now, thank you for your patience and welcome back! Everyone new to this, I recommend reading the other analyses first, but either way, I hope you'll enjoy this! **Timestamps**: On most devices, Netflix only shows the remaining time if you pause (on some both the remaining and the actual time), so I'll keep that format, marked with the abbreviation ""re"" for ""remaining"". &#x200B; ## 105 BOTTLED APPETITES &#x200B; ## Connecting Themes &#x200B; Opening the second half of the season, this episode itself can be divided into two parts: The time before Yennefer first lays eyes on Geralt (31:44 re), and the time after. Geralt's and Yennefer's first meeting is obviously the defining moment of the episode; here we have two characters who were seperated by time and space before, only connected through the themes of their storylines. Now, before and even after they meet, there are still several themes connecting their storylines and their characters, as well as Ciri's. So let's take a look at those. &#x200B; **Beauty, desire & chaos** ""What do you desire?"" (12:34 re, Yennefer to Geralt) Everyone who watched the episode will have noticed quite an uptick in terms of nudity and sexual themes: The doppler gloating over his naked reflection in the mirror. The pair in Rinde looking for a cure for erectile dysfunction, naked Beau Berrant looking for apple juice. The magically-induced orgy. Yennefer spending half the episode half to fully naked. A steamy bath scene where the sorceress and the Witcher explore each other. The final sex scene between them. But what does it all mean? The first obvious parallel manifests between Yennefer and the doppler from Ciri's arc, who uses other people's involuntary donated body parts ""to round out your artful composition"", as Cahir observes (56:25 re). There is a cost to his **enchantment**, paid by other people's lifes, and there is a cost to Yennefer's enchantment, paid by giving up the possibility to create life. ""**Children** are our favorite"" (51:30 re), the doppler tells Cahir, still in his Adonis-form, hinting at something one rather would not like to think about further. Both Yennefer and the Doppler use magic or have used magic to form a **desirable appearance**, and they both have a ""desire"" for children, albeit for very, very different reasons; one is in the pursuit of ultimate **beauty** while the other one tries to undo the sacrifice she has made for that ideal of beauty. Yennefer is clearly someone who knows how to use her **sexuality** to get what she wants; in this case, to make Geralt let down his guard and manipulate him into punishing the people who've annoyed her in the past -- with a little help of magic, lilac and gooseberries, of course. She uses her subtle weapons to ""inflict **pain**"" (37:34 re), as she tells her former mentor Tissaia -- while putting on her blood-red lipstick, preparing for her ""business"" (34:20 re), the magic orgy. Tissaia points out that Yennefer is ""pure **chaos** right now"", and the search for the cure makes her ""sloppy"" (36:31 re). This pursuit for having a baby puts everyone around her in danger -- Geralt and Chireadan, who end up in prison, about to receive the death sentence; Jaskier, the supposed Djinn's master, who wakes up after being cured, only to get threatened by Yennefer with a knife; and even the town of Rinde, unknowingly endangered by a Djinn who was set loose. Geralt also recognizes the chaos within Yennefer, saying that even the Djinn could not wreak ""more **havoc** than you"" (09:58 re). As Yennefer is clearly viewed as dangerous by other people, so is Geralt. ""Go ahead, ask about them"" (27:20 re), he tells her as she notices his **scars** during the bath scene. It may be a moment of sexual tension between the two, but Geralt's scars are more than just an addition to his sex appeal; they tell stories, some of which he'd rather forget, as shown by a similar scene in 103 between him and the prostitute. They tell the story of his dangerous lifestyle as well as of his vulnerability, as some are Renfri's. Yennefer also has scars that remind her of past weaknesses, as Geralt deduces. The **desire** they have for each other is evident from this scene on; Geralt is trying to have a look at the naked sorceress, while she later sizes him ""up quite right"" (24:39 re), to have a good look at his assets. Meanwhile, the Dryads debate about what to do with Ciri, now that they know who she is due to Shan-Kayan's revelation, who apparently got its answer for who this child is. Eithne defends her, saying ""she's a girl"", while the Dryad General points out that this is a girl ""who possesses the **power** of a weapon"" (in Elder, 46:40 re). This harkens back to 101 ""The End's Beginning"", where Ciri's magical powers implied the potential **danger** for everyone around her, just like Renfri's. This time, the episode parallels Ciri and Yennefer instead; they both are connected to the magical chaos and both cause chaos. Ciri's innocence is what seperates her from Yennefer, the pain that is inflicted upon others is neither her fault nor her intention, while Yennefer does it knowingly in pursuit of her desires. &#x200B; **(Dis)trust** ""And I do love a good old-fashioned trap"" (21:58 re, Yennefer to Geralt) Continuing with the dryads, protective General seems to mistrust outsiders, especially Ciri, explicitly saying that ""we can't trust her"" (in Elder, 48:57 re). As mentioned before, she sees her as a risk, a **threat** to the Dryads and Brokilon forest. Interestingly, this is the precise reason why she lets Doppler-Mousesack into Brokilon instead of having him shot down (like Dara), signaling to lower the weapons right after he says that he's ""come for the girl"" (06:20 re). In her view, this is an opportunity to get rid of Ciri and therefore an uncontrollable magic weapon. Ciri trusts the mysterious and unexplained appearance of Doppler-Mousesack; the General's distrust as well as Ciri's naiveté lead her right into the Nilfgaardian **trap**. Speaking of traps, even though Yennefer seems to succeed in making Geralt drop his guard somewhat, he still suspects something: ""Do you doubt my capabilities?"", she asks him while he checks on Jaskier, to which he answers: ""No. Just your **intentions**"" (24:32 re). Before that, Yennefer also voices her doubts over Geralt's motives for his search of a djinn: ""And to pretend you're after a djinn to cure insomnia?"" (25:24 re). They both begin distrusting each other, but only Geralt turns out to be right about his reservations. &#x200B; **Desperation and cures: Rubbing salve on a tumor** ""Find a whole new career to fund what you... so **desperately** want"" (49:52 re, Hemet to Yennefer) After Yennefer's old life abruptly fell apart in 104, she is looking for a new path, and of course for a **cure** to regain her womb. ""The Continent is vast"" (35:50 re), she tells Tissaia, who questions her wish for a baby. By showing confidence and even arrogance, she tries to cover up her deep desperation in this matter. She goes to the openly slimy Hemet to buy ""treatments"" (50:39 re) and later she puts her own life and that of others in danger to control the djinn. ""True **transformation** is painful"" (13:25 re), she yells at Geralt, who tries to stop her suicide mission. This of course refers to her first transformation in 103, the one that set everything in motion, and back then, it was arguably an act out of desperation, trying to undo the damage of Istredd's betrayal by enduring excruciating pain. This is the mindset of Yennefer, there's no **sacrifice** too big for what she wants, which is ""everything"" (34:25 re, 13:05 re), as she tells both Tissaia and Geralt. Unfortunately for Yennefer, this sacrifice is the **root** for further desperation, first the child and then (*spoiler for 106*), the relationship with Geralt which she thinks was never real after all. Meanwhile, Geralt has his own set of problems; in his own, blunt words, he ""can't fucking sleep"" (42:55 re) and he ""just want\[s\] some damn peace"" (40:35 re), as he tells Jaskier impatiently. The bard provides his unique insight into Geralt's problem, suggesting that Geralt's abandonment of his suprise child may be the **root** of it. While Yennefer seems to struggle to find her destiny, Geralt chooses to ignore it. He goes to ""extreme measures"" to **cure** his imsomnia without having to confront the root problem, even though he recognizes that, ""yes, I'm **desperate**"" (27:47 re), as he confesses to Yennefer. Ciri also struggles with desperation, having lost her home and everybody she'd known -- or so she thought. When Doppler-Mousesack arrives, as mentioned before, she naively follows him and makes her decision to leave Brokilon. Something that drives her in this decision is the desperate wish to return to her **old life**, symbolized by Mousesack. &#x200B; **Family & childhood, belonging & purpose** ""Happy childhoods make for dull company"" (26:18 re, Yennefer to Geralt) All three main protagonists share **traumatic childhoods**: Ciri had to live through the fall of Cintra and the death of her royal family, Yennefer was sold for four marks, and Geralt? Well, it's not clear at this point, but he sarcastically remarks that the magic which created the witchers ""made for a magical childhood"" (26:21 re). All three had to fight to **survive**: Ciri escaping the war, Geralt fighting both monsters and humans, and Yennefer having to ascend to not get turned into an eel. But what are they fighting for? Yennefer was rejected by her family, Ciri's family's gone, and it takes until the end of the season until we learn about Geralt's past. Indeed, they are all looking for a family, a place to belong, and through that, purpose, even if they're not fully aware of it yet. Ciri seems to find a new **family** in Dara, she even tells him that ""you're my family too now, remember?"" (04:07 re), while also reuniting with Mousesack, who is ""like family"" (05:17 re), as Dara observes. Ciri sees Mousesack as a remainder of her home, but Dara sees him as a reminder of the brutal loss of his own family. The real Mousesack's last moments were determined by Cahir, who ""found his **purpose**"" (54:48 re), as he tells Fringilla. As the druid dies, Cahir assures him that Ciri ""will end up where she **belongs**"" (52:09 re), and the doppler tells Ciri something similar: ""I've come to take you to your rightful place"" (05:07 re). Ciri ""must make the **choice**"" (44:58 re) to stay in Brokilon or continue on her search, as Eithne tells her. The Nilfgaardians have already made that choice for her, a third way that remains shrouded in mystery, but is undoubtedly tied to ""her **identity**, her past, her ties to Cintra"" (in Elder, 46:55 re), as the Dryad General tells Eithne, who is well-meaning towards Ciri, a potential **mother-figure** not unlike Lilja Ozol in 102. Ciri ends up rejecting her, choosing the path that her grandmother has set for her. Or so she thinks. As Ciri is on the run from Nilfgaard, so is Geralt -- on the run from Ciri. **Trapped** in an ongoing cycle of insomnia, he suffers the consequence of running away from his **destiny**. As in the last two episodes, he again chooses to get **involved**, to save Yennefer from a certain death, even when he is no longer under her spell -- ""And yet, here I am"" (14:14 re), he declares. He saved the Striga because of wanting to save a princess instead of killing her this time; he saved Duny because as with Renfri, he saw a person where others only saw a monster, and he saves Yennefer because he sees in her what he saw in Renfri -- a woman he could **love**. s*poiler for 106*, which also explains his last wish. Geralt is bound to a life on the road, and he seems to embrace his **identity** as a Witcher, since even when he is presented with the choice to wish ""not to be a Witcher"" (12:36 re), he does not make that wish. ""When did you last feel happy when you felt trapped?"" (09:50 re), he asks Yennefer after letting the djinn go free, a reflection of his life as a monster hunter -- even though he is free to roam the Contintent, his life basically forbids having a family or to get involved. But he does just that, because despite his stony exterior, he cares about others, and he looks for love, as evidenced by Renfri and Yennefer. And perhaps even for a family. Yennefer has left the service of Aretuza and the kingdom of Aedirn after late king Virfuil's successful attempt on the life of his wife and child, the latter's senseless death being the inciting incident for her wish to have a **legacy** \-- a child of her own, and with that, a **family**. ""Not being bound by the rules of the brotherhood"" (50:31 re), she has chosen a **lonely** life without any ties to an institution or allies, having to live ""off the grid with no resources"" (50:29 re), finding herself struggling to generate money to pay for Hemet's so-called services. Later on in the episode, she seems more comfortable with her life, having taken control over Rinde and by that a relatively easy path. Tissaia criticizes that and warns her that she may ""become just like them... **irrelevant**"" (36:36 re), urging her to ""return to Aretuza"" (35:35 re). But Yennefer rejects Aretuza as Ciri rejects Brokilon, which is not a place anymore where she **belongs**, but rather a place where she always felt **trapped**, as she did in Aedirn after that. She already assessed in 104 that **purpose** and legacy are not found in a sorcerer's career as she once thought. She chooses a path of her own, but there's no guarantee that she can have the legacy she wants. &#x200B; **People linked by destiny** ""Love, that's nice, but not on the cards for me. Not in my lifetime. It took me nearly a whole one to find him"" (49:23 re, Middle Aged Woman to Yennefer) As mentioned before, the big, central moment of this episode is certainly the first meeting between Yennefer and Geralt, uniting two of the three main characters and their story- and timelines. This central moment is accompanied by some **reunions**: Ciri reunites with Doppler-Mousesack, Tissaia visits Yennefer, and Jaskier finds Geralt on the road: ""What's it been, months? Years? What is time, anyway?"" (44:31 re), he asks the grumpy Witcher, providing one of the two clues to the passing of time in this episode; the timejump that happened between 104 and 105. The second more indirect clue is Tissaia telling Yennefer that ""I haven't seen you for years"" (37:26 re). Yennefer and Geralt's meeting is foreshadowed in the beginning of the episode, when Yennefer helps the Rinde pair with their lover's problem, as featured in the introductory quote in this section. The wording of ""a whole \[**lifetime**\]"" is especially interesting here, because it also took the Witcher and the sorceress one if not more than a lifetime to find each other. Many times the show's timelines have been criticized for not just being confusing, but also lacking any story justification -- the criticism is, that essentially, it's just a gimmick intended to make the viewer feel smart. Yet this quote and the whole theme of meetings in this episode seem to suggest that this timeline puzzle is also intended to underline the significance of **destiny** and **people** linked by it -- no matter the distances in space \*and time\*, they ""will always find each other"", a quote from the season finale. ""Destiny is just the embodiment of the soul's desire to **grow**"" (42:08 re), Jaskier declares rather theatrically, and yet, this quote seems to bear weight for the whole season's big main theme: Destiny (if you haven't guessed that after approximately 50 mentions of it). But how does the soul grow? How do characters grow? By constantly being put to the test, having to make their own **decisions**: ""The sword of destiny has two edges"" (45:04 re), Eithne tells Ciri, who has to make the decision to stay or go. It implies that people are not simply bound to destiny like unknowing slaves to their master; there is the freedom of choice, but not the freedom of consequence. Even though ""her grandmother's dying wish that she should go to Geralt of Rivia"" (05:01 re), Ciri's destiny remains in her own ""hands and no one else's"" (03:44 re), as Eithne tells her. The only question that remains is, even though the characters can choose a path, does destiny dictate where they end up in any case? Is there free choice after all in this world, or is it an illusion? &#x200B; &#x200B; Until next time, and if you enjoyed this, consider leaving a comment or sharing this whenever you think it might be helpful or interesting to someone!",
774,"Childhood emotional neglect venting (29/M)I’m coming to terms with the fact that I’ve had some traumatic things happen in my early adulthood which I believe are linked to passive childhood emotional neglect. Only recently have I come to realize that this can in fact be traumatic in similar ways to more malicious forms of trauma. I’m trying to reconcile that my parents did the best they could, had great intentions, with the fact that it wasn’t enough for me. And that it’s okay for me to feel that way even if I appreciate a lot of what they did do for me. I’m writing this as a venting session, to share my story, and maybe just to get some validation. My childhood was pretty good. I say that as someone who works in public schools and sees the types of environments that a lot of kids grow up in. What I mean is - my family was intact. Mom and dad are still married. We weren’t rich but we were solidly lower-middle class. Money was tight but we lived in a house. My dad worked a ton and was pretty “absent” as a kid. I never had the coolest, newest things, but I had the basics. I don’t remember these days, but I have been told up until my early elementary days I was a gregarious, fun-loving kid. I recall being heavily attached to my mom in my younger days. I was very soothed by being physically close to her and playing with her hair. She allowed this for many years, but at some point it stopped. I’m not sure if I told myself I didn’t like it or if she told me to stop based on gendered expectations. But I do believe it became a “boys don’t do this” thing, I’m just not sure which of us was really driving that sentiment. Around 4th/5th grade I began to feel very lonely, isolated, depressed, and suicidal. I have a vivid image in my mind of a suicide fantasy I imagined that was killing myself dramatically at my elementary school with a knife in a bloody pool. I contemplated suicide in countless other methods, but this one is the most vivid in my memory. This seemed really odd at the age as none of the other kids I knew seemed to be struggling like this, and I couldn’t place a finger on why I was suffering. Actually, there was 1. And her life was seriously fucked up. Blatant, extreme abuse. Between my early elementary years and when I started struggling with what I later learned was significant depression and anxiety, something changed. I was no longer the gregarious, fun-loving kid. I was becoming more and more the bitter, angry, avoidant pessimist. My theory is that my mom was extremely caring and nurturing when it came to basic emotions and small children, but did not appropriately model how to deal with the more complex emotions that arise after we start separating from our parents and developing our independence. I believe this is a long process that begins in early elementary. I spent my evenings and weekends distracting myself in video games and chatting with other angsty kids in AOL chatrooms. A not-insignificant part of what bothered me during this time was social ostracization. I had been tracked into “gifted” programs at school, which led to being socially labelled in a way I didn’t want to. I faced some teasing and bullying about it, and this is about the time (5th grade) my self-worth issues really began to manifest. I began to feel empty, sad, hopeless. I spent a lot of time dwelling on the knowing knot of emptiness I felt as I cried myself to sleep every night. Excelling academically was my way of gaining what I thought was support and approval from my mom, when I really needed basic emotional support with developing a healthy self-image. My self-image became tied up in my academic achievements. In a dichotomous way, I became simultaneously hyper-confident in my academic abilities by hyper-self-doubting in my social abilities. I began to develop social anxiety and constantly worry about whether I could be accepted by my peers. I think one big pitfall was my mom not proactively recognizing this as something that might happen. I’m not really sure if I made an effort back then to truly communicate with her, but from my adult perspective of course this is something I would be looking out for in my kid. It was my teacher who brought up concerns about my mental health to my parents around this time. I recall my parents being really afraid and stressed out by it, and utterly surprised. They had no clue I was going through with this. I have a lot of anger about this period because, as someone who works with kids as an adult, I absolutely would recognize the signs of depression and anxiety in a child this young. Those are not normal behaviors. And it flew right past my parents’ radar. I don’t doubt I was withholding, but… the signs were there. They sent me to therapy, of course at a “Christian” therapist which automatically undermined any confidence I might have had in the therapeutic process (which was already pretty low to begin with). I wanted to feel better, but I didn’t want to talk about it because it was painful and I didn’t know that was part of feeling better. I had not been modelled emotional intelligence and therefore was confused about these complex emotions. I did not have the vocabulary to express them or the logical understanding or awareness of how to help myself not get caught in their loops. By this point in life I was already bitter about being forced to go to church my whole life when it seemed like a strange cult to me from a young age. I went to therapy for a brief period of time. Maybe a few months? I recall sessions going as follows. I would show up. The therapist would ask a generic “how are things going?”. I would say “fine” or “okay”. Or maybe divulge a little bit. But there was no more than 5 minutes of discussion about my actual feelings. Then he’d ask if I wanted some treats. He’d give me a soda and a candy bar. And we would spend the rest of the session playing DOOM on his computer together. I guess he probably thought if we bonded I would open up more. I can only guess with that. But spending our sessions doing that seems wildly inappropriate from my adult perspective. He was letting me drive the conversation, which is not how it’s supposed to work. After a brief period of sessions of me clamming up and withholding information and him giving in, he asked me if I felt I was ready to be done with therapy. “Yes” said the depressed, suicidal, ten year old, who wanted to get back to playing Diablo and chatting with my angsty AOL friends. And that was it. Him and my parents went along with me being okay and as if the episode had passed. As an adult who works with struggling and traumatized kids, I am so angry about this. This should not have been my call. If I heard this story about a kid I know I would be so frustrated at the amazing lack of emotional intelligence all around. Fast forward a few years - middle school, 7th or 8th grade. I’m still connecting with the girl from my elementary class who also was depressed and suicidal. She was one of my closest friends during this time and my first “middle school girlfriend”. We would chat in the evenings and on weekends about what was going on with us. We would talk about suicidal ideation and cutting. At some point, someone (who I suspect had to be her) anonymously notified my principal that they were concerned about me harming myself. An intervention happened. I was called into the principal’s office and interrogated until I admitted that yes, I was still super depressed and self-harming. This was passed on to my parents. I went home and had to have that conversation with my parents. They did not handle it well. They approached it from an attitude of authority and forbidding, rather than caring and understanding. They treated it like they do at a psych. ward- aggressively stopping harm regardless of therapeutic value. “Show me your arms! Are you cutting?” Somehow I was able to relatively quickly evade this conversation as well and, yet again, convince my parents that I was okay despite the clear red flags I wasn’t. They let it go, and I continued to suffer and they continued to be oblivious to it. This continued into highschool, including my crushingly low self-esteem and suicidal thoughts, as well as constant social anxiety and feeling of rejection (even though I wasn’t actually being rejected in any way by my peers at this point.) I continued to drown myself in video games and other moody depressed online friends because they were the only ones I was comfortable with that level of intimacy with. Not my parents, or my therapists. When I was 17, I met a girl who brought light into my world. For the first time since 5 or 6 years old, I felt understood, accepted, and nurtured. She came from her own traumatic situations so we trauma bonded pretty strongly. For the years we were together I was relatively much less depressed, because I finally had some external validation of my lacking internal self-worth. She made me feel worthy and valuable. And we had a lot of fun together. We were together for 5 years before we got married at 22. I realize now my eagerness to go all-in on this relationship showed my desperation for connection and my lack of appropriate boundary setting. We were extremely codependent and spent a lot of time self-medicating with alcohol and bitching about our parents. Near the end of our relationship I began to get treatment for my depression and anxiety for real for the first time, and she was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. Part of her illness was being extremely impulsive. This usually manifested in what I considered small, lightly irritating ways. She was always buying, reselling, and upgrading things. Clothes, phones, computers, apartments. She could not stay content with where she was. Around 23 she stopped taking her meds for her Bipolar (to this day I’m not sure why, probably just a manic episode), and started seeing someone else (for the second time in our relationship). A few months later she told me she didn’t love me anymore and wanted a divorce. I was fired from my job the same week. I had to move back home with my emotionally neglectful parents at 24, broken from a divorce and job less. It did not go well. Since then, I’ve worked on rebuilding things. I’ve done a lot of therapy. I’ve taken my treatment more seriously. I went to grad school and became a teacher. I had several long-term relationships that ended in equally as dramatic a fashion as my first. Unfortunately my anxiety and depression got so bad I was hospitalized and had to take a break from teaching two years ago and haven’t felt able to return yet. Right now I’m really working on just prioritizing my healing over everything else. And I’m proud of the progress I’ve made. But in that progress there’s recognition of a lot of pain and struggle. Thanks for reading my story. &#x200B; EDIT: A few details I forgot to mention that I feel give some context as well: 1) I have a memory of when I was 17 being dropped off at school by my mom and her saying ""Love you!"". And me being completely rocked because I literally had 0 memories of her saying those words to me, even though I knew she did. That's a wound that still hurts, even though we say it to each other now. 2) I've talked with my two older brothers about this, who also struggle with anxiety, depression, and emotional intimacy. They are in agreement about our parents being loving and supportive to the best of their ability but still inadequately.",
775,"Severe abuse broke me, but I am recoveringMy father is a sober man, but for all intents and purposes he was always drunk on his ego. A rampant narcissist and borderline psychopath, my father is responsible for most of my suffering in life. Certainly, I take responsibility for my fair share of personal shortcomings, but we live in a world of cause and effect relationships. The roots of child abuse run deep, and they form a tangled web in my psyche that has led to me being a homeless recovering addict with a colorful spectrum of mental health problems. One of my first memories is being thrown across the room when I was four. I don’t remember why I was tossed like a ragdoll, but I distinctly remember sipping my juice box while my mom talked with the police officer at the front door. I feel obligated to share the strength of this memory, because my father would later deny these events ever happened. Gas-lighting is common for him - he routinely chooses his ego over family, which was apparent as I tried to bridge the gap between us on my spiral down to the streets.I’ve decided to go no contact with him after recent outreach attempts have returned the same condescending, compassionless responses. When I asked for fatherly advice while feeling desperate and suicidal, he had little more to say than “don’t kill yourself,” and “get your shit together.” It is that lack of loving care that I desperately wanted my whole life, without ever realizing that it was his approval I needed more than anything. Instead, I lived for vengeance, as I saw my father as the personification of pure evil. In the beginning stages of my schizoaffective symptoms (though I wouldn’t know anything was wrong until later), I created and believed a whole mythology of how I was a god who was tormented by my deity of a father for being imperfect - a perfect mirror to what was going on in my real life. After my mother died when I was nine, I was left with my father who began dating again. I remember my life was divided into sagas, where each new person he brought into my life waxed and waned, as he could only keep up the appearance of being a saintly widower caring for his son/daughter (I’m mtf trans but didn’t know until much later in life) for so long. His mood would reflect the state of his relationships, and his abuse, both physical and emotional, would ramp up to extreme levels when things weren’t going right for him. For instance, when I was ten, his second major relationship was starting to turn rocky. During this time, the water line burst in our basement. While he was hauling the water up, he asked if I had done my homework. As it was a Saturday, I hadn’t. I had no idea why he asked outside of giving him an excuse to pummel me. You see, after berating me for being lazy, he got furious with me and soon we were on the floor. He was over me, smashing my head into the linoleum of the kitchen floor. This happened several times as afterwards I had to help get the door for him while doing my homework. Naturally, my hands were shaking and I slammed the door open trying to be as efficient as he wanted me to do. Soon after all the water was drained, his girlfriend called and he was calm again. We went out to dinner with her sons that night like nothing ever happened. When I was eleven, his future ex-wife left for a darts tournament. I suspect something was amiss around this time, because my father was in a really sour mood. I tried to avoid him by playing video games, but this just pissed him off more. During this time, I eventually forgot to take out the trash from the kitchen, which led to him dragging my by the leg to my room, punching it and making me think he was going to break it. He didn’t, but he picked me up, shook me, and began smashing my head into the back of my door, breaking that instead. After throwing me to the ground and telling me to lay there like a dog, he proceeded to clear out my shelves - which contained everything my mom had ever made me - in two rabid sweeps of him arms. I laid there, completely frozen in shock, as he cleaned up the mess he made. When he finished and was about to go to the dump, he made me stand. I would continue standing perfectly still for the remainder of the day until I passed out some 8-10 hours later. During this time, he would come to me and ask if I had anything to say. I tried coming up with an apology for being selfish and not thinking of his needs during this time, but nothing I said was good enough. Near the end of the day, he would begin lecturing me and insinuate I was a horrible human being for choosing to play video games when my mom was close to death. That sort of psychological torture was common. In high school, I would become bulimic because I was not good enough for him in track, despite owning half of our school’s record board and competing on a national level. There was a time when I was practicing three times a day, once in the morning, and then twice back to back in the evening. He was living vicariously through me, as self-evident by the fact that he still has all the rewards I earned plastered on the walls of his living room. When I failed, he failed, and that was not tolerated. He wasn’t mad, he was livid, a fact he repeated many times as he shit in my soul for nights at a time. On top of this, everything I did was criticized and I was belittled for the smallest things. Once I cut my hair the way I wanted, which really wasn’t that different than how it was before, and I didn’t hear the end of it for weeks. He still stalks me on social media, but while I still lived in his house, most anything I posted was met with a sarcastic comment or at least something letting me know he was watching everything I was doing. That sort of hyper-obsessive and vile watching eye is what led to me living in denial of my identity for so long. In fact, for the longest time, It has felt like I had a dead limb attached to my psyche, there but unable to be interacted with. Now, it feels like my masculine and feminine energies are like oil and water. I’m still healing and mending who I am, so eventually this may change, but right now I’m stuck in a nonbinary state that is ever-changing. Additionally, I live in a slipstream of synchronicities. I like to say being schizoaffective is like being bipolar, but the aliens are constantly abducting me in order to protect me from the CIA, who is creating a reality TV show around my life. Every day it feels like the universe is sending me messages, most of which revolve around me not being good enough and that I need to improve. It’s not hard to see how my psyche was molded over time to perpetually trap me in a reality built of the quicksands of negative self-image. Still, I’m in an infinitely better place than where I once was. I’ve been sober for a few months now, and while there are moments of weakness where I feel I may use again, I have a greater sense of a mission on this planet that is guiding me toward brighter futures. I may be homeless, but the experiences I’ve had on the streets have been the most radically transformative of my life. I feel infinitely more independent than I once was. My core philosophy is that free will is a skill - if we walk down a new road every day eventually we will be able to navigate to any destination. If we are regularly pushing our boundaries, we cannot help but step outside our comfort zone and expand as a person. Having no stability has forced me to recondition myself, opening new doors and avenues for myself moving forward. I’m so much more calm and present than I once was. Even though my emotions are still a roller coaster, it feels more like a kids ride now, and at the very least I have stopped self-harming since being on this new concoction of medications. I am hopeful for the future. More importantly, I am grateful for the present. Being grateful changes everything in our perspective; it is like wearing glasses to see the world through a different lens. I may have traveled through some harsh roads growing up, but if I didn’t I would not be who I am right now. Every experience is a blessing, and we are all here to enjoy the ride of our lives. The highs would be meaningless without the lows, and there are so many small moments of joy to be found in every day. There is only up from here, and I want to bring some of the light I have found into others’ lives. I hope you found something meaningful in my story, and I hope you have many bright days ahead of you.",
776,"Unresolved Halloween Disappearances (United States)With halloween approaching, I think it's important to reflect on people who have gone missing on halloween, who remain missing to this day. Although it's a fun holiday and a time for families and friends to bond, there is an inherent dark side. This is an incomplete list of people who have gone missing in chronological order. I am only including suspicious disappearances, and not including lost/injured missing or people who have left voluntarily without suspicious circumstances. Enjoy your halloween, stay vigilant, and be safe. 1. [**Steven Damman**](http://charleyproject.org/case/steven-craig-damman)**(2)- 1955 (Nassau, New York)** ***Circumstances:*** On the day of halloween in Nassau New York, 2 year old Steven Damman's mother, Marilyn, had brought both him and his baby sister the grocery store, and left them out front for less than 10 minutes while she went inside to purchase some bread. When she returned, both children were missing. His little sister was recovered unharmed, still in her stroller, only a few blocks away. Steven has never been seen again. In November of the same year, a student at Queens College wrote several letters demanding ransom from Steven's Parents, with which they attempted to comply. It was quickly determined that the student had nothing to do with Steven's abduction. If alive today, Steven would be 66 years old. ***Theories:*** Many have speculated that Steven may be [The Boy in The Box](https://www.historicmysteries.com/the-boy-in-the-box/) but in 2003 this theory was disproven by DNA comparison with Steven's sister. In 2009, a man named John Barnes from Michigan contacted police saying that he was Steven, but a DNA test ruled out this possibility as well. Many people speculate that Steven's mother has something to do with his disappearance, but nothing I could find indicated that police had ever considered her a suspect. Other's have speculated he may have been taken by someone desiring to raise a child, or a child predator. No arrests have been made in the connection with his case, and Steven Craig Damman remains missing. 2. [**Patricia Spencer (16) and Pamela Hobley (15)**](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/halloween-mystery-where-are-girls-who-vanished-from-oscoda-michigan-45-years-ago/) **-1969 (Oscoda, Michigan)** ***Circumstances:*** Patricia Spencer and Pamela Hobley were high school students from Oscoda, Michigan who vanished on Halloween of 1969. Both were seen together earlier in the day when they were supposed to be attending classes, although several people have noted that they wouldn't be considered friends. They had told her parents that they would be would be attending a party after their High School's homecoming football game. It wasn't discovered until later in the night that neither had arrived to the party. A man had stated that he had given them a ride earlier in the day while they were walking along River Road, and dropped them off downtown. Police had speculated that they had run away, but both families disagreed. They had not taken any personal belongings with them, were very close with their families, and had no reason to run away. The trail of the case quickly became cold, with no police leads except a possible connection to the Oakland County Child Killer, which police confirmed is a highly unlikely connection. ***Theories:*** The most accepted theory in the community is that Pamela and Patricia were abducted while hitchiking by two men from Oscoda, and buried near a remote barn that was a popular location for high school parties. Policed searched the area extensively, but turned up no signs of human remains, even with the aid of cadaver dogs. The man who owns the property, the man who says he picked them up that day, and Pamela's new fiance are not considered suspects in their disappearances. 3. [**Donna Lee Bonnell**](https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/32122?nav) **(35) - 1978 (Graham, Washington)** Donna Bonnell went missing from Graham, Washington on Halloween of 1978. I cannot find a single bit of information on her circumstances of disappearance, but her NAMUS profile describes her as a white female, approx 5 feet, 8 inches tall and 200 pounds. She had brown hair and hazel eyes, and was last seen wearing a tan raincoat, and dark pants. If you know anything about this case please message me so I can add the information. 4. [**David Cruz**](http://charleyproject.org/case/david-cruz) **(29) - 1980 (Allentown, Pennsylvania)** ***Circumstances:*** 29 year old David Cruz was last seen on Halloween in Allentown, Pennsylvania. It is believed that he had gone to meet with an unknown person, or persons, to collect on a debt. No specifics are ever mentioned as to who owed the debt, or what the debt was owed for. Although he was last seen on Halloween, he wasn't reported missing until November 7th 1980. He is considered missing under suspicious circumstances, and foul play is suspected in his case. ***Theories:*** If it's true that he went missing while attempting to collect on a debt, it's possible that he was met with confrontation and killed, either intentionally or accidentally. Allentown is located in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania, where there are many desolate roads leading into the mountains, as well as a lot of old mining sites. If David had been killed and dumped in the mountains, it would be incredibly difficult to locate him. No suspects have ever been named in his case, and the trail went cold shortly after he vanished. 5. [**Kristi Vorak**](https://missingchildren.wikia.org/wiki/Kristy_Lynn_Vorak) **(13) - 1982 (Tacoma, Washington)** ***Circumstances:*** 13 year old Kristi Vorak was living in a foster home in Tacoma, Washington. Although she did not have a history as a runaway, she frequently was seen roaming the streets of Tacoma and surrounding areas. A witness believed they saw Kristi on Halloween night at a bus station in Seattle, but this sighting has never been confirmed. It is unclear if she was reported missing on halloween, or in the days following. Who reported her missing is also unclear. Police believe she is deceased, but her mother believes that she is still alive and living in Seattle. She has never been heard from again. ***Theories:*** Many people believe that she may have been a victim of Gary Ridgeway, the [Green River Killer](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gary-Ridgway). He was active in the area during the 80's and 90's, and his first known victim was a 16 year old foster runaway. She was reported missing in July of 1982, and her body was found in the Green River a few weeks later. It was thought Kristi Vorak could be [Jane Doe B-10](https://unidentified.wikia.org/wiki/Jane_Doe_B-10) or [Jane Doe B-17](https://unidentified.wikia.org/wiki/Jane_Doe_B-17), but she was ruled out as being the identity for either. 6. [**Nancy Penner**](http://charleyproject.org/case/nancy-ann-penner) **(28) - 1983 (Paradise, California)** ***Circumstances:*** Nancy had been invited to a Halloween Party by a friend on Halloween of 1983, which Nancy had accepted. Her friend became worried when she didn't show up. When her brother couldn't reach her when he tried to invite her for thanksgiving, and then Christmas, he reported her missing. She was last seen on October 31st, and was not reported until December 19th. Nancy was a mother of two children, living with her boyfriend Jeff Jeffries. Her boyfriend had stated that he came home one day with blood all over the house and Nancy gone. On December 22nd, Jeff took Nancy's two children to Hawaii, and returned with them. He then left her son, Omar, with relatives in California. Jeff left her daughter, Yana, with family in Iowa. Jeff committed suicide in Missouri in 1986, citing a recent breakup as the reason. Omar, now an adult, states that he remembers Jeff shooting his mother in the bathroom, but the date of this is memory is unclear. Police found a bullet lodged in the bathroom of their home, which corroborates this memory. She remains missing, and the case went cold after Jeff's suicide. ***Theories:*** Nancy's son, Omar, believes that Jeff murdered his mother and buried her in a remote area in Butte County, California, or disposed of her body down a mine shaft. This is the most widely accepted theory. Other theories state that she left her family behind to begin anew somewhere else. Some people believe that she could be [the Newton, GA Jane Doe](https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/11097) or [Appling, GA Jane Doe](https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/4705) although the possible link from California to Georgia is unclear. Her body has never been located, though her son, now known as Daniel, has [never stopped looking for her](https://www.newsreview.com/chico/finding-my-mother/content?oid=1869627). 7. [**Wendy Abrams-Nishikai**](http://charleyproject.org/case/wendy-jamie-abrams-nishikai) **(21) - 1989 (Berkely, California)** ***Circumstances:*** On Halloween 1989 a 21 year old University of California Berkely student went missing, leaving behind a husband and 2 year old daughter. While the California Department of Justice lists her as voluntary missing, family member's have their doubts. I am including her case with this list because her family believes she was abducted, and did not leave of her own volition. 8. [**George Ivan Waters**](https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/7882?nav) **(22) - 1991 (West Palm Beach, Florida)** This is another case with very little information. The last time anyone remembers seeing George Waters was on Halloween of 1991. His case is considered suspicious because he was in possession of some very valuable land, that apparently he was in the process of selling. What makes the property so valuable as well as why he was selling it, and who he was selling it to is unclear. Foul play is suspected in his disappearance, because the sale of the land was never completed, and he has never been seen or heard from again. 9. [**William David Dudley**](http://charleyproject.org/case/william-david-dudley) **(31) - 1993 (Winchester, Virginia)** ***Circumstances:*** On Halloween night, 1993, William Dudley had an altercation with his girlfriend, Cindy Denner, on property owned by Denner's grandmother where the pair and their young daughter resided. According to Cindy, William was intoxicated and frequently became angry and violent when he was drinking. After he hit her in the face, two of Cindy's male relatives became involved in the altercation. One of the families hit William with a baseball bat, and according to witnesses he then apologized to Cindy, and stumbled back to the trailer that he lived in, close to the main house. He has never been seen again. His mother became concerned that she hadn't heard from her son in several weeks, and she was the one who reported him missing on December 5th, 1993. ***Theories:*** The family members, Roger Denner and Glen Kerns admitted to police that they had fought with William that night, but denied any involvement in his vanishing afterward. They are considered persons of interest in his case, and many believe that he was killed intentionally or unintentionally during the altercation, and is buried somewhere on the property. 10. [**Sylvia Ann Lee**](http://charleyproject.org/case/sylvia-ann-lee) **(17) - 1995 (Campbell, California)** ***Circumstances:*** Sylvia was last seen on Halloween in 1995 after saying goodbye to her boyfriend en route to the light rail station in Campbell, California. She was going to see her grandmother in San Jose, but never arrived there. ***Theories:*** In 2011, Wilbur Atcherley pled guilty to Sylvia's murder, stating that he had gotten into a taxi with her at the light rail station, taken her to a remote location in New Almaden, killed her, and put her body in a creek bed. Taxi transactions from that night corroborate this story. Police searched the area but found no signs of her remains, and believe that they were washed away. 11. [**Kimberly Forbes**](https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/878?nav) **(48) - 2004 (Hood River, Oregon)** ***Circumstances:*** Kimberly Forbes vanished Halloween 2004 after informing her teenaged daughter that she was going to have breakfast with a friend a few miles away, and then go shopping alone in Portland, something uncharacteristic of her. She always took friends with her when she went to Portland, but said they were all busy on the day she planned to go shopping. She was reported missing when she failed to show up for work the next day, also uncharacteristic of her. Her 2000 Ford Explorer was found on November 19th, over 55 miles away from Hood River. The vehicle had been broken into, and the seat was not situated for a woman of her height. Fingerprints found in the car were matched to a man who admitted to breaking into the car, but denied involvement in her disappearance. ***Theories:*** Kimberly was known to have had several online boyfriends, but a search of her computer turned up no plans to meet with any of them on the day of her disappearance. Her family and police believe that she was met with foul play but have never arrested any suspects in connection with the case. There have been no further leads, and she remains missing. 12. [**Cameron Hardman**](https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/13465?nav) **(31) - 2011 (Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania)** ***Circumstances:*** Cameron was reported missing by his mother after he failed to return from spending time with friends in Philadelphia on Halloween 2011. A week later, his vehicle, a 2001 BMW 740i was recovered seven blocks from where he was headed to spend time with friends. He has no history of vanishing, and always stays in contact with his family. There have been no leads in his case, and foul play is suspected. 13. [**Christina Bastian**](https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/31151?nav) **(34) - 2015 (Apple Valley, California)** ***Circumstances:*** Christina was last seen on Halloween, 2015 with her small dog, Coco. She had been visiting a friend, but left around 1:45am after becoming upset. She left her wallet and glasses at her friends house, which is unusual because she needed them in order to see, and was not wearing contacts. A few hours later, police located her truck, though it had new scratches and dents. Christinas dog was located on November 1st by a woman who then posted the dogs image on a lost animal facebook page. A family friend confirmed the dog belonged to Christina. Christina's backpack was located on a dirt road a few miles away, but further searches did not turn up anything of significance. A few days before, her apartment had been broken into and she began acting very erratically. She took the sim card out of, and broke, her phone before driving to Phoenix and back on the same day. She had bipolar disorder and had recently stopped taking her medication. ***Theories:*** Christina's family and friends think it's possible that she vanished of her own volition, however that doesn't explain why her items were located on a remote dirt road, separate from where her truck was discovered. It is possible that she met with foul play, and the trail went cold quickly after her disappearance. There are many others who have vanished and remain missing. Please feel free to point out any information I may have gotten wrong.",
777,"Me (24M) Wife (24F) Things that are on my mind. Hello Reddit, first I would like to apologize because this post is probably going to take the form of a rambling rant and this is just a lot that I feel like I need to get off of my chest. I came to you a while back with some problems with my home life. Ultimately I took the advice of this community and separated from my wife, there was a whole host of issues but the most prominent thing was that she has a major depressive disorder and was using suicide as a means to keep me Tethered to her (I don't think that her Express intent was manipulation but I had been in a situation prior where a woman that I was with used sex manipulation and threats of suicide to keep me in it and I wasn't willing to go down that rabbit hole again). That isn't going to say that there weren't good times within the relationship, I love her and I still do. During the separation, we had kept in contact, and in the end before we separated I got her some help in the form of taking her to a stress Clinic where they admitted her on a psychiatric hold. The doctors at the stress Clinic got her properly medicated and she really seemed to be improving on a whole. But during that time on the inverse side of things, she had proven to me that she was unable to support herself without me, she was making very reckless decisions as far as her personal life went, blowing all her money and savings on pointless things, losing her job, up to and including some pretty negative things that almost happened to her had I not jumped in to save her last second. I found myself still paying all of the bills at an apartment that I was no longer residing in. Nevertheless though from an emotional health standpoint she had improved and a lot of the issues that I had with her had almost entirely dissolved, she was a whole new person. One day we got to talking and eventually I agreed to move back in, she wasn't living very well on her own, she couldn't support the apartment that we used to share, and I missed her a lot. We are back together now and things are going so so, I'm already beginning to see that things are deteriorating again and whether she meant to or not I think she may have sexually manipulated me. I feel as though I may have made a mistake during the Separation by continuing to sleep with her, it was an almost daily thing at that point where as prior to the separation it was maybe every week or two. I don't think I'm necessarily in a bad place now, but I see myself falling back into the trend of her being unhappy and me doing everything that I can to try and alleviate her unhappiness, and nothing I do seems to work. I will provide an example: she claimed that we have no food in the house that she is willing to eat and that everything we have is gross and that she is not happy with what we have, so I had her make the grocery list and I went out and bought everything that was on the list; but we still don't have any food in the house that she is willing to eat and everything that we have is still gross. When I questioned this logic it was met with irritation and the excuse that I did not give her enough time to work on the list (I gave her an hour) and that I should simply let her do the shopping next time. My only problem with this is that she is still incapable of controlling her spending habits, and if I give her a budget of $100 for a week she will spend $150 and call that close enough, the extra 50 will be on clothes or makeup or non necessity items that I feel should come out of her personal spending money not set aside for bills or food or necessary items (IE: laundry detergent, trash bags, toilet paper, etc.). Another thing that's been irritating me lately is that she refuses to clean up after herself, and I feel like I'm married to a child sometimes... Well a lot of the time. I went on strike a couple weeks back and it didn't really have the desired effect I was hoping for. My line of thinking was that if I didn't clean for long enough she would get tired of sitting around in her own filth, she did not tire. Instead my apartment slowly filled up with garbage and for about a week I was walking on McDonald's bags and her dirty clothes and makeup that she had left out that was getting crushed into the carpet. I would like to tack on that she would rather spend $400 a month on McDonald's then cook a meal, that's probably an exaggeration it's probably closer to the $200 mark but she refuses to cook out of laziness. She says she doesn't want to cook anything if it isn't going to be ""worth it"". Eventually I caved in and decided to start cleaning, I will admit that I was in a huff about the whole ordeal I wasn't very happy that I'm courteous enough to clean up after myself and she expects me to do the same for her because "" I'm cleaning up after myself anyway, so why can't I gather up her trash while I'm doing so"". She also pitched a fit because I requested that she help me clean; given that most of this was her mess. She claimed that she cleaned the bathroom last week and that I should take the rest of the house because the bathroom was very hard. Eventually though, she begrudgingly agreed to help me, and the housework did get done. I am now residing in a moderately clean apartment which is nice for a change. Unfortunately though I never seem to be able to stand my ground in an argument because to her all the points that I bring up regardless of logical stance are invalid and unimportant. It feels as though all that is important in these situations is that she is right, and when it gets to a point where she realizes she is wrong she decides without fail that she wants to end the argument because "" this is stupid, why do you have to always start arguments with me, I am not going to continue this conversation"". F\*\*\* I'll say it, I am very unhappy. The only caveat to my unhappiness is that for some reason or another I am incapable of putting an end to this. I know she can't support this place on her own, I have other places that I could go, but she doesn't. She has no friends or family to turn to, and I am her only pillar of support. I think where I have fallen in now is that I don't want to see her in pain without me, and I also know that she is incapable of taking care of herself, and I just have this innate desire to help her and hope that eventually she'll be able to take care of herself so I am I able to leave. I realize this sounds really messed up but this is the head space that I'm in right now, and I'm not entirely sure how to get out of it. I find myself fantasizing about another life on a daily basis. I would love to just drop off of the face of the Earth, change jobs, move maybe a town or two over, buy a new car so that I can leave her with the one that we share currently, and eventually move myself into a nice quiet one bedroom rental house in an upper-middle-class area and just be by myself. Anyway I feel like I have gotten what I need to off my chest for the most part, any comments or questions or advice is welcome. I will answer / respond to everything to the best of my abilities and for those of you who choose to read this in its entirety, I appreciate the time that you've invested, and I'm sorry that this isn't more interesting.",
778,"2nd MDMA sessionHey everyone, figured I'd post about my 2nd session and also ask for some advice on another subject. I went into my 2nd session with the intention of addressing the cause of my abandonment fears and anxiety. I was having trouble letting go and my therapist gave me some psilocybin ( i mentioned i had done the combo before so she was cool with it). The journey became a bit spiritual. It was about trust and love- both of which i seemed to have depleted within me (who knows but i had such trouble receiving/giving love to myself it scared me- nonetheless i have taken 5 doses of ayahuasca and that did it for me) during the journey it was a bit unclear but it seemed that I was shamed for being a loving/empathetic child while growing up and that it wasn't acceptable in the house- it was almost laughed at. Neways- i had a pretty big god moment and was shown that the universe loves me unconditionally all the time regardless of anything- even if i don't know how to love myself- i received a bit of this compassion but was really scared to let go- it showed me an analogy that my families support/trust was of a net that had holes in it and that the universes net is tightly stitched and totally trustworthy. Ive had a little bit of relief since the session but its not permanent. it comes and goes.. On to the advice portion. This began after a vipasana course this sept when i dug up some trauma i was not ready to deal with.I don't even know what the trauma was but i came in touch with my younger self and he was hiding and sensed that something fucked up had happened. Prior to this I had been disassociated/i guess depersonalization anxiety/depression/cptsd... over the past year I've been using plant medicine and have done two vipassanas. I'd say at this point I am about 80% in my body. Since this vipassana in sept I've began to feel terror like never before. A helpless feeling that I'm going to lose it (it feels like I've taken this too far) I was close to committing suicide like never before but was able to hold off. Ever see a dog thats been hit by a car and is laying on the side of the road weeping helplessly, knowing he/she is going to die? I haven't haha but have seen it in movies and that how i feel. I feel like I'm on the brink of loosing it sometimes. I' guess I may have re traumatized myself? And I am refusing to put up the walls/defenese mechanisms so I'm on the cusp of the trauma? I will mention that prior to the vipassana I have been living in a full fledge compulsive state. every behavior was compulsive from the time i woke up to the time i slept and that Ive been addicted to porno/sex addiction for the past 20 years which I've also kicked since march '19. I have another MDMA session scheduled for february but I'm a little worried- The state I'm in now is tolerable- it sucks sometimes but i can't do anything about it- and I feel conscious enough to not take on defense mechanisms like going numb/dissasociating further etc..so i feel like I'm on the brink of a massive wound and sometimes it feels like I'm losing touch. If you could help me understand what is happening w me that would be lovely. I know this is all over the place-sorry if its confusing- i really don't have the focus to rewrite it- if its unclear ask me about it and ill do my best to explain.. thank you! and good luck to everyone going through this !",
779,"Felt brave. Might delete later.A small backstory about me. I am autistic. In this context it is important because I am habitual and pattern dependant. Changes very heavily impact my functionality even when for the better. I also have a dissasosiative disorder. I am chronically ill and am on the best options I have to treat that but I am in a lot of pain even with pain management. I am the child of a parent with a long ongoing addiction history. I have a history of use but no actual addiction issues. I seem to just have tried to mimic how she coped. So the thing: I used to be a heavy drinker. Scary heavy. I hid bottles or just left them around. Had people deliver me alcohol so I wouldn't ever need to be sober. I drank on average either 3 bottles of wine, a bottle of gin or a carton of cider a night. I barely ate. That was... 8 years ago. I pulled myself out of what was basically an extension of my ED (saving calories to drink replaced bulimia for a while) and a suicide mission with the help of my now husband and barely drank for a couple of years. Now I'm comfortably drinking up to 6 drinks maybe 4 nights a week THOUGHTLESSLY because they assist my pain management and sleep. I rarely actually enjoy a drink anymore unless it's mindful and not to ease pain but to just enjoy a drink out or something. I am capable of not drinking - I do not have a drinking problem as much as I do a process problem( yes I have mental health care, no they are not worried about my drinking and havent been in years). In the last 2 weeks of being mindful about why I am choosing to drink I have poured wine only to have to pour it out because I do not want it - it just auto piloted it. Im proud I'm catching myself at that point but I'd like to know if there's any help anyone can give me in breaking my patterned autopilot. To clarify. I have spoken with my partners and doctors about ways they can help me. I am not scared or worried I'm slipping I'm simply struggling with a restrictive pattern. Community feedback and discussion has been widely agreed to be useful for me as well as simply putting into words my intents. TL;DR - tips for intervening autopilot actions for restrictive patterned people.",
780,"I think I accidentally cursed someoneThis one is long and heavy. There's some sensitive topics in here. I'm a beginner, but I was introduced to witchcraft about five years ago (I'm a 19 y/o trans guy). As of now, I don't particularly have the resources or space (I live with my Christian parents) to regularly practice, so my materials are in a lockbox under my bed. I don't attempt powerful stuff - I mostly cleanse negative energies and bless my household. I know intent is a lot of what drives witchcraft, so now I pose my question: is it possible to unknowingly curse someone? I'll spare you the long, complicated backstory, so here's a summary: About two years ago, there was someone that called me her best friend. Unbeknownst to me, she tried to get my then boyfriend (now fiancé) to cheat on me with her on multiple occasions. She kept it from me for months while still pretending to be my friend. When my boyfriend told me, I absolutely broke down. I relapsed and self harmed, I lost trust in most people, and I still had to see her face every single day while she acted like she'd done nothing wrong. I bonded with her boyfriend over this situation, and he is now a good friend of mine. I became his confidant. He would tell me he didn't know how to leave her, and it got to the point that he didn't want to live anymore. I was really worried about him. That's when I considered magic, but I couldn't really find anything to help this situation. A break-up spell? A binding spell? These spells were either out of my capabilities, or I thought they were frankly overkill. So I tried to think of something of my own. I lit a few black candles and got a photobooth picture of her and I. I cut it down the middle so we were separated. I took her half and held it. I started crying and just repeated, ""I wish she wasn't around us anymore."" I did something strange that I wasn't really sure would do anything - I sewed white thread through the picture, crossing over her face like the laces of a shoe. Then I put her half of the picture in a cloth bag with a pinch of Himalayan salt, and I threw it in my lockbox. I was extremely emotional the whole process, and I don't know if that could influence the strength of a spell. I didn't know what other implications there could be. Now we'll get to what happened in the course of the next year. She graduated early, and I haven't seen her in person since, not even in public. She and her boyfriend separated and I supported him during the process. He got visibly happier and healthier, and I was thrilled, thinking that my spell worked. But then it went bad. Please know: what happened next, I did NOT ask for, and would NEVER wish this on another human being. By this time, I had forgotten about my spell sitting in my lockbox. She had a miscarriage that was relatively soon after the breakup. She didn't know she was pregnant. I didn't have any contact with her, but I still felt an attachment to her and would check her facebook page occasionally to see if she was doing all right. Not long after, she then said she could possibly have cancer. I continued checking on her page occasionally for updates. Sometime afterwards, I wanted to pull out my tarot for an unrelated reading. That's when I saw the cloth bag I'd put the picture in. I suddenly remembered this spell I had done. I figured I didn't need it anymore, since it worked, so I burned each thread, then disposed of the salt and the picture. This is what happened afterwards, about a year ago: She announced that she does not have cancer. She and my friend got back together, and now she's pregnant, due in February. My friend has become suicidal again, and I don't know how else to help him other than be his moral support. He plans on leaving her, but he's responsible for this child and is therefore tied to the mother as well. So, we're back to where we were before the spell. Recently I began to see the symmetry of the situation. I really don't know if I'm overthinking this, or if this is the biggest series of coincidences to ever happen to me, but that's why I need help. I never meant any ill will towards her, so I don't know if it's even feasible for me to have cursed her. I'm sorry that this post is so long but the situation is so complicated, I don't want to leave out any details. At the very least, if no one has any insight regarding the spell, any advice on helping my friend is much appreciated. Thank you.",
781,"16 points and other material in support of antinatalismHi all, fairly new here. Below, I am going to put material that I plan to use on a blog I am working on. Please share your thoughts on it, how you would improve it, what you disagree with, any points or other thoughts you might add to it, etc. Thanks! One of the philosophical positions that I hold is what is known as ""antinatalism."" I am going to briefly explain what antinatalism is, and then provide extensive reasoning to support why I think it is correct. This treatment of antinatalism will include discussion of ethical matters. As you read this material, please do keep in mind that, like other material on this blog, what you read here and/or the implications of what you read here, may be, and likely will be, at least initially, shocking, disagreeable, unconventional, unpleasant, uncomfortable, disconcerting, and/or difficult to grapple with. As with other material on this blog, I encourage you to read this material carefully, and to try to refrain from making your mind up about the material until after you have been able to read through all of it at least once. Also, as I talked about in the ""Foundations and Framework"", it may be beneficial to read through it all more than one time in order to fully grasp and understand what is written. Antinatalism is the philosophical position that assigns a negative value to the birth of a human (it can also include animals, depending upon an individual's specific version of antinatalism). It could stop here, and just contain the proposition ""Human birth has a negative value."" But, it can go further, and extend to include the proposition ""It is unethical to have children""; many antinatalists subscribe to this further proposition. This means that if antinatalism is correct, if an individual were to have a child, doing so would be unethical. As a result of viewing procreation as being unethical, antinatalists try to avoid participating in a human being created. Some will take measures such as using condoms, birth control, getting a vasectomy, etc; others will go as far as refraining from all sexual activity with members of the opposite biological gender which are still capable of reproducing if they are still potentially capable of reproducing, as this carries some risk, however small it may be, of leading to a human being created (For example, if a male who has had a vasectomy were to have sex with a female who has not had a hysterectomy, there is some risk of procreation, because vasectomies are not 100% reliable). This latter approach may seem extreme and also unhealthy and/or simply not an approach most people are capable of, but for the antinatalist, myself included, if this is such a serious matter, and we do think it is, then an approach such as the latter is not unreasonable, and really is the most consistent approach to take. Below, I am going to put forward 16 points in support of antinatalism, and then provide some ""supplemental"" quotes that may help you, the reader, to better grasp this philosophical concept. Point 1: Minimization of undue human suffering If one agrees that we have an ethical obligation to try to minimize undeserved human suffering, in order to be consistent and intellectually honest, one will be an antinatalist. I will explain below in formal logic argument form why one must be an antinatalist in order to be consistent and intellectually honest IF one agrees that we have an ethical obligation to try to minimize undeserved human suffering. Premise 1: We have an ethical obligation to minimize undeserved human suffering Premise 2: We do not have an ethical obligation to create people in order for people to have good experiences Premise 3: Antinatalism is one possible way of trying to minimize undeserved human suffering Premise 4: To agree with the first 2 premises and yet reject antinatalism as one possible way of trying to minimize undeserved human suffering, absent any good reasons to reject antinatalism as one possible way of trying to minimize undeserved human suffering, is to be inconsistent and intellectually dishonest Premise 5: There are no good reasons to reject antinatalism as one possible way of trying to minimize undeserved human suffering (For anyone who might disagree with this premise, and put forth reasons such as the fact that humans have a survival drive and reproductive drive, the fact that there could be no good experiences and no happiness, etc, please see material below after the conclusion of this formal argument). Conclusion: Therefore, if one agrees with the first 5 premises, and one desires to be consistent and intellectually honest, one will be an antinatalist Point 2: Consent Due to the nature of reality, it is impossible for a couple to ask their children before they are conceived if they are ok with being brought into existence. It is impossible to obtain the consent of a non-existent person to be brought into existence because they do not yet exist. Due to the horrific things that can happen to a person in this life, as well as all the unpleasant, undesirable, and otherwise disagreeable things in life, a person should be asked if they are ok with being brought into existence in this life. Bringing a person into existence in this life without their consent is unfair to said person because of the above reasons in this paragraph. Because of this, and because, as mentioned in the last paragraph, getting the consent to be brought into existence from a person before they exist is impossible, couples should therefore refrain from bringing a person into existence in this life. Point 3: Prevention If you really love someone, and care about someone, you will shield and protect them from horrific stuff. There are some things that no one, perhaps except for evil people, should have to go through. Why are parents exposing their children to the risk of such things happening to them by bringing them into existence? Parents say stuff like “If I tried to protect you from everything, from every pain, then I wouldn’t be doing the loving thing, and I wouldn’t be doing what’s best for you. If I tried to protect you from every pain, you wouldn’t be able to grow.” While this is true, and is a good point, what about horrific stuff? Shouldn’t they try to protect their children from horrific stuff? Don’t they have a DUTY to protect them from horrific stuff? If protecting a person from something horrific, because it is horrific, is reason enough to protect them from said something horrific, then isn't it also reason enough to never expose them to the risk of that something horrific happening to them in the first place? The best way for parents to protect and shield their children from horrific stuff is to never bring them into existence in the first place. Consider the following quote from a Reddit poster (username unknown): ""We have reached peak insanity. Instead of trying to prevent something terrible from happening in the first place, a solution to solve the problem after it has occurred is the best option."" Point 4: Child disappearance Children disappear every year, never to be heard from again. The psychological damage that this can cause parents and siblings, and the bad things that could happen to the child, should be reasons sufficient to not have children. It's foolish, arrogant, and prideful for a couple to think that this cannot happen to their children. It’s possible that a child could be kidnapped at a young age, and kept locked in a basement for 15, 20 years. When they are rescued, they are likely going to be developmentally delayed, and possibly even permanently damaged and broken beyond repair. It’s also possible that a child could be kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery. Again, if you think these are ""made-up"" scenarios, do the research, this kind of stuff does happen in the real world. Point 5: Reaching a psychological breaking point There’s the saying “everyone has a breaking point.” People, even people in military special forces, have a breaking point; when someone reaches this point, they just break. No one should end up in that place, no one should have to go through that. If a couple knows full well that one day their potential children could reach this point while still in their household or once they are out on their own, why on earth would they bring them into existence? Why would they be willing to expose someone to the risk of that happening? Is the reward really worth the risk? Point 6: A psychological prison It is \*possible\* for a person to reach the point where they don’t want to live anymore, but are unable to bring themselves to commit suicide because they are worried about the mess they would leave behind, and/or they simply cannot bring themselves to harm their own body. So, they are left stuck living a nightmarish existence in which they don’t want to exist, but they can’t bring themselves to make themselves stop existing. They are like a prisoner; they are trapped in a prison that is a result of circumstances not of their choosing. Why would you bring a person into existence when it is possible for them to reach that point? Why would you want to create something that could potentially reach that point? Where is the compassion and empathy for people in these situations? Point 7: Notable scenarios It's mind-boggling that people who have worked in military, police, espionage, intelligence, firefighting, EMS, disaster response, search and rescue, mental health, and medical jobs, and have seen the horrific things that can happen to people, still want to, and do have, children. What if some of that same stuff happens to their children? Do people just not think about this stuff? Do they just not care? Some of these people may have seen pictures of and/or have encountered first-hand the aftermath of NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) accidents and warfare; why would such people have children? There's two things folks should think of here: 1) The probability that at least one of their children could be injured as a result of NBC accidents or warfare is greater than zero. It is technically possible that it could happen to their offspring. What if it happens? What then? That person is going to suffer tremendously, perhaps for a long time. What about the rights, feelings, thoughts, dreams, desires, and the life of the individual? Why expose a person to the risk of this happening to them? And, keep in mind that nuclear stuff can affect people down the genetic line after the original injured person. For example, there are descendants of people whose DNA was negatively affected as a result of the atomic bombing of Japan in World War II that deal with issues passed down to them via genetics. 2) From a more self-centered point of view in terms of the parents, this is a parent's child we are talking about here. What if it happens to their child? What are they going to do to fix the problem and make it all better? Not a thing. Not one single solitary thing. They'll sit there and scream and cry, and throw up, and heave, and cry out to God, and ask God why, and curse God. And after all that, their precious child's life is still completely FUBAR, and nothing will ever change that this side of life. Do people just not think about the possibility of this mess happening? Are they playing the odds, and betting it won't happen to their children, and hoping they'll win in the sense of their children having a normal, happy life? Do they think about the possibility of this mess happening but still have children because they just don't care about anyone else outside of their self? It is also mind-boggling that people who have been molested as children (both of my parents were), raped, tortured, etc have children. After having experienced any of those, why would anyone create a being that could potentially have that happen to them? The parent can take a lot of precautions to try to make sure that it does not happen to their child, but they cannot eliminate the possibility of it happening. Despite their best efforts, it could still end up happening. So, why would you create a being that could potentially have that happen to them after having seen how awful it can be to be the victim of such crimes? The parent who decides to have children despite the fact that they cannot eliminate the possibility of one or more of the aforementioned crimes from being inflicted upon their child, is presented with a dilemma: Do they try to protect their child, and consequently cause them to miss out on a lot of activities that their peers are not missing out on, or do they let their child participate in activities with their peers, but in the process expose them to a greater risk of having one or more of the aforementioned crimes inflicted upon them? At the end of the day, it seems that what it boils down to is selfishness and/or self-interest: The parent wants to have children. So, basically, by having children despite the fact that they cannot eliminate the risk of their child having one or more of the aforementioned crimes inflicted upon them, they are saying to their children: “Sorry buddy, but you are just going to have to be exposed to the risk of having horrible stuff happen to you because I want to have children, and my desire to have children is stronger than my desire to minimize your suffering."" Point 8: Risk of becoming a monster A simple issue that perhaps makes all other issues unnecessary to be addressed: It is not right for a couple to bring a person into existence when it is possible that one or both members of the couple, via their own choices or through no fault of their own, could end up becoming a monster and treating the person they brought into existence horribly. When a person is growing up, their parents, and especially their mother, are supposed to be the two bastions in the child's life, and be there for and protect them. Point 9: World setup First, when a couple brings a child into existence in this world, because of the way this world works, and because of the way most people are, there is a high probability that their child will end up being either a tool of the wealthy elite, dependant on government aid, or homeless. This is common sense, it shouldn't take a rocket scientist to see the reality of that. Why impose that on someone? Why bring someone into such a world? It is not ok, and is not fair to bring someone into such a world. Second, in this world, it is difficult to live and function without at least indirectly participating in people and animals being negatively affected. Why bring someone into such a world? Third, it is foolish for the couple to trust their future, and the future of their child, to the government of the country they live in. Governments cannot be trusted; governments cannot be trusted to act in the interests of the couple and their child, to take care of them, nor to protect them. There are two reasons why this is: 1: Governments can be, and are, influenced by, and intertwined with, private entities, including corporations, and possibly also shadowy, wealthy ""elites."" Therefore, it is conceivable that because those entities have more influence and power than a couple and their child do, should their interests be at odds with with the couple's and their child's interests, a government will act in their interests, not the couple and their child's; if you think this is a bunch of paranoid conspiracy talk, do some research into it. 2: There may be situations where the government may act in a way to protect the public interest, and in doing so, they harm the couple and/or their child. And finally, fourth, when a couple brings a child into existence, they are putting them at the mercy of governments, which across history have a horrible track record of treating people decently. Like many other things I talk about in this post, why would you do that to someone whom you supposedly love and whom is supposedly precious to you? Point 10: Parents putting burdens on their children Parents put all kinds of burdens on their children that shouldn’t be put on them; in some cases, the burden is put on one or more of their children directly, and in some cases, the burden is put on one or more of their children indirectly. In most cases, I would say it isn’t intentional, but it still happens. When a couple brings a new person into existence, they are making it possible for this to happen; this could be avoided by the couple simply not ever bringing anyone into existence. Point 11: The future is unknown One might argue that some people have decent, or even really good lives, but the problem is that when a couple decides to have a child, they have no way of knowing if their child’s life will be bad, decent, or great. It is possible that the person's life will be great, but there is no guarantee that it will be; it is possible that the person's life will, through no fault of their own, be bad, or at least that there will be one or more very bad developments in their life that basically ruins their life. Why would you create a person that could potentially have a bad life, or at least have one or more bad developments in their life that basically ruins their life? In addition to the basic reality that a couple does not know the future of their potential child, there's the fact that when a couple brings a new person into the world, they are guaranteed to suffer, but there is no guarantee that they will have a good life. If a couple knew with 100% certainty that their child would have a good life with some suffering but not so much that it makes their life bad, I'm willing to concede that perhaps the reward would be worth the price. But, the problem is that this is not the case. The case is that it is possible for someone to be brought into existence, and suffer, and overall, not have a good life. Is it really worth it when this is possible? Why make that bet when there is guaranteed suffering, and no guarantee of a good life? If that risk is going to be taken at all, shouldn't the person who has to directly deal with bad events in their life get to decide if the risk is taken rather than two other people taking the risk for them? Consider the following quote from a poster on Reddit: ""So your saying, its perfectly alright to play Russian Roulette pointing the gun at an innocent child (gamble with their well-being), even though they weren't in a position to understand the implications of existence or could consent to it. You also need to understand that in the state of non-existence a person is not deprived of happiness in the first place, it has no desire to experience happiness. Why do you think this gamble is alright to be played at someone else's expense?"" Source: [https://www.reddit.com/r/antinatalism/comments/bvubqi/im\_so\_tired\_of\_expectations\_just\_a\_vent/](https://www.reddit.com/r/antinatalism/comments/bvubqi/im_so_tired_of_expectations_just_a_vent/) Point 12: Pain vs pleasure First, consider that most people would agree that pleasure is ""good"", and pain is ""bad"" (exempting situations where someone ""has it coming to them"", in which case they deserve the pain, and do not deserve the pleasure). Second, consider whether the basic sensation of pleasure or the basic sensation of pain is stronger. If pain is a stronger sensation than pleasure, then it seems that it would be better not to bring someone into existence and put them in a situation where a bad sensation, pain, is stronger than a good sensation, pleasure. With that said, even if pleasure is a stronger sensation than pain (which is debatable), if one never comes into existence in the first place, they will not be exposed to the bad sensation of pain, and they are not being harmed by not coming into existence. Why not save them the bad sensation of pain when there is nothing wrong with not bringing them into existence? Point 14: Siblings can be affected People should look into the future and think of how horrific stuff happening to one of their children would affect the siblings of the child. It’s not fair to children for them to see their siblings suffer, especially when they did not even choose to be born. Point 15: Finding meaning in life “You have no justification for imposing the burden to find meaning in life on someone else. They are not harmed for never coming into existence, but coming into existence does harm them, and it isn't a guarantee that they'll find meaning in that existence.""

Consciousness has become over-evolved in humans, therefore making us incapable of functioning normally like other animals: cognition gives us more than we can carry. We want to live, and yet because of how we have evolved, we are the only species aware that it is destined to die. We are able to analyze the past for broad expectations of the future, both our situation and situations of others; we expect justice and meaning in a world where neither occur. This ensures that the lives of conscious individuals are tragic. We have desires and spiritual needs which reality is unable to satisfy, and our species still exists because we limit our awareness of what that reality actually entails. Human existence amounts to a tangled network of defense mechanisms, which can be observed both individually and socially, in our everyday behavior patterns. According to Zapffe, humanity should cease this self-deception, and in consequence, passively end its existence by living out the lives already created but actively abstain from procreation, thus ceasing to create new lives.2 Assorted supplemental quotes ""You just so happened to have been born into a life of more happiness than suffering, but you could have just as easily been born into a life of misery, and your parents had no right to gamble with fate like that, and bring you into existence brazenly unconcerned with how good or bad your life could end up being."" ""Especially when you consider that the vast majority of people who have ever lived (and the majority who currently live today) did not live relatively privileged lives of First World comforts. Most of the people who have ever lived lives of hard physical toil, oppression, deprivation, untreatable illness, and were surrounded by death constantly, especially the deaths of their close family members. It would not be unreasonable at all to say they experienced significantly more suffering than joy in their lives. And then you have to account for the concept that almost everyone agrees suicide is wrong and someone should not do it under any circumstances. Which just raises questions about consent. Someone is allowed to bring you into existence without your consent, but you don't have the right to take yourself out of existence? Sounds a bit like slavery.""

People chase an idealistic dream off the suffering and hope of others it's shameful and disgusting. Positivity at all costs ignores the bad, ignore the bad it grows until it becomes unbearable and makes us unable to fix things. People who are deemed not positive enough or with issues that can't be fixed will slip under the cracks, be shamed, and shunned for being who they are. The realistic best thing for us and all life is for it to never have existed no bad, no good just neutral without undue harm to anyone for whatever reason.” Source: [https://www.reddit.com/r/antinatalism/comments/aar8q8/is\_a\_lifeless\_earth\_ideal\_do\_you\_regret\_all\_l](https://www.reddit.com/r/antinatalism/comments/aar8q8/is_a_lifeless_earth_ideal_do_you_regret_all_l) ""Perhaps, but isn't it an awful gamble to bring something from the void into existence knowing you could burden them with relentless suffering and disappointment? Like sure that's great if you cant find contentment in life but I think you're missing the big picture of billions of humans suffering from abject poverty, tyranny, environmental destruction, disease, etc. Even in developed democratic countries countless people struggle day to day with a lack of meaning, death and sickness of loved ones, failed relationships and discrimination. I don't think antinatalism precludes recognizing beauty, humor and a deep appreciation of everything aesthetic. Some of the basic aspects of antinatalism \[seem\] grim because it really fights against our blind biological imperative but I think the true passion behind antinatalism is the deepest and most sincere feelings of empathy.” Source: [https://www.reddit.com/r/antinatalism/comments/a56b0b/i\_am\_working\_a\_12\_hour\_minimum\_wage\_slave\_job\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/antinatalism/comments/a56b0b/i_am_working_a_12_hour_minimum_wage_slave_job_and/) Family, love, companionship, and sex I can see how one, after reading all of the above material, might get the sense that I totally am against family, love, companionship, sex, etc. This could not be further from the truth; in fact, I still strongly believe in, support, and appreciate family, love, companionship, and sex.

782,"I need helpHeads up, this is going to be a bit of sleep deprived rant, but it's intention is a cry for help - My grandmother was diagnosed with FTD at 52, lived 10 years, mostly in a zombie like state and finally passed in 2008. This was obviously gut wrenching and also alarming given how young she was. Fast forward to 2018 and my mom (at age 60), starts showing some of the same signs my grandmother did - socially inappropriate, angry outbursts, forgetful, going in the shower with articles of clothing still on, lack of empathy, etc. I thought at first she was just getting old and ornery, but it finally clicked. Once it did, I couldn't believe I didn't put it together before. She hasn't been to a doctor for any of this or been diagnosed, but it seems fairly obvious what is going on. My Mom currently handles everything - the bills, the taxes, the laundry, EVERYTHING including taking care of her own aging dad. I talked to my step-dad and he also has seen these changes and is scared. He is a tough guy, so once I knew he knew something was wrong and is scared, my world sort of fell apart because now I know it's real. Since this reality has sunk in, I'm in a full panic 24/7. I have not slept without waking up every hour in a heart thumping panic in weeks. What keeps me up are these realities and questions - * My Mom doesn't know anything is wrong. We don't want to tell her because we think she will commit suicide, but this poses many problems stated below. I also wonder if not telling her is ethically the right thing to do here. * Her driving is fine now, but I want those who are getting in the car with her to know her condition before they decide to ride in it. I don't want her driving my kid, nor any others I care about, but how do we tell her this without letting on what is happening? What happens if she plows into a bunch of kids on the side of the road - that will haunt me as something I could have prevented. * We don't know what paperwork needs doing, but we know she does not have a will and is a homeowner with her husband, my step dad. What paper work should we get her to fill out now while she can and how do we convincer her to without telling her something is wrong? Do we need POA's for anything? How does one get POA, fill out a form? Where do we get the form and how do we make if official? So many other questions about paperwork. * **Will I also get this?** This sends a cold chill down my spine. The more I've read trying to find something comforting, the more I fall into total hopeless despair. I know I have a 50% chance, and for me and my pessimistic attitude, that means I will or already have it. **I feel suicidal over this**. I have never felt suicidal before until now. I'm 39 and have a wife and a young child and feel like the sooner I do it the better to try and give them as long as time as possible without me so that they can get over my death sooner. I know I can get the DNA test, but I'm too much of a coward to get it. I realize this makes no sense if I am suicidal anyways. I also have an older sister who feels the same way. This is all so tragic given my younger sister did commit suicide years ago, and now the remaining of us also want to follow. Life is bleak. * I feel like we should give my Mom the option of suicide while we still can. I feel like as a family we should give her permission to do so and let her do things on her terms. I don't know how this would go down or the legalities involved but I feel like it should be her right to do so. I live in CA and there is no death with dignity conditions in the law here that allows for suicide of the demented. * How am I going to hold down a job carrying all this? I provide the sole income in our household. I need to help my stepdad with all this and can barely manage my own suicidal thoughts and anxiety. I also have a chronic illness that has me in pain 24/7 on top of it all. * How do I help my stepdad? I don't even know what needs doing or how to help myself. And because we are hiding this, I cant just call him all the time and talk it out - me and my stepdad never called each other before all this so my Mom would be suspicious. * I need sleep. I take 600mg of gabapentin a day, lots of CBD oil in the AM and in the PM, magnesium, chamomile tea, meditate, go to church, read books before bed, NOTHING HELPS and I'm going insane over it. Or perhaps this is my own dementia starting? I know this is a lot, but if there is anyone out there that can give me some advice on what to do next, or how to cope, encouragement, anything I would appreciate it greatly. I feel lost and hopeless, without a future, sad for my kid, a useless coward and utterly defeated.",
783,"Opening (The officialized opening to Holy Conquest!) Holy Conquest “Have you ever seen a corpse? This is an exquisite one!” In the tangible world, Jay was laid back, sprawled out on a couch covered in half-eaten snacks and recently worn robes. The chrome head gear plugged directly into his brain stem, and so in his mind he was in an auditorium, about 6 meters away from the gorilla being operated on by a pulsing swarm of cybernetic ants. The coordinated storm continued to speak. The lag between the beeping robots and the translation software in his helmet frustrated Jay, because he found the indecipherable chirping distracting and the technical medical jargon dense, with the result being he could scarcely follow either. “Analysis of the vacuum function relating the corpse’s on-going Entropic dilation to last known sentient operation can determine both relevant local Death calculations and nonlocal post-mortem valuation vectors.” Jay could follow about half of that. Just as well. In the auditorium, his simulated self furiously typed and saved Notes. In the tangible world, his scarred body laid mostly immobile, his crimson tail twitching intermittently in the dark. The ants had begun swarming around each of the limbs of the gorilla, shining a symphony of lasers of all different colors. The lasers formed shapes, cubes with impossible dimensions, each face analyzing and describing some fact about the corpse. Jay was feverishly writing Notes with a futile desperation he was acutely aware of. For every idea he could capture, there was a wave of information washing between his fingers, and overall Jay found the process preposterous. *I must be a video game character or something. Someone scripted this. This is nonsense.* For as long as he could remember, Jay’s running internal dialogue went something like that. Once he got into the swing of things, he felt a bit less existential; but he often wondered exactly when and where he would see his stats. There had to be stats. How you stack up against everyone else, what you’re most efficient at, what your flaws were. It maddened Jay to no end that no one would tell him his weaknesses. How exactly was he supposed to keep track of them if one of his weaknesses was ignorance of personal flaws? But no: it was always about how good Jay was. How well he tested and scored. Ah, you can absolutely and most definitely handle this course; you’re one of the good ones. “From the sum of all convergent series of nonlocal valuation, we can determine greatest sentient interest and evaluate the market of competing sentient interests to produce a gradation of evolutionary incentives to respawn.” A day never went by where Jay didn’t feel hopelessly lost. He got the gist of what they were talking about, because he could relate it to every day life: reanimating the dead was big business. Guaranteed employment, no matter which Dome he went to, because no one wants to die, and most prefer not to stay dead. The Afterlife is filled to the brim with desperate Souls bidding on this corpse or that. But the metaphysics of it all eluded him. The mathematics shamed him, and the chemistry seemed smug. It wasn’t as if he could even ask for advice; aside from Leah, whose looming intelligence made even the Formics nervous, Jay was considered the smartest of the Sapiens; a position he loathed, because he always felt like a hopeless monkey gibbering maniacally in a cage. The lasers converged, and a holographic image of the gorilla as it must have been before it was shot in the head began displaying above the swarming mass of robotic insects. “Mediating communication across nonzero sets of one-way communication requires implicit acceptance of uncertainty that grows exponentially as accurate observatory functions build in self-referential complexity. Therefore, emotional vectors are considered more relevant factors of any consistent logical paradigm such that they can be evaluated with reference to local and non-local authoritative verifications.” Suddenly, a blue screen pops up, pausing the lecture. “Request from Minerva – Priority Highest.” Goddamn Minerva. Her generation thinks every faint wisp of an urge requires sending in the troops. Jay sighed and moved his digital avatar to click Accept. A new menu popped up with the drunken scribbles of the Dome’s Grandmaster. “Yoou r doing good, but we need you to do great. Constructive critique of the day: always be on top of thinkgs. I need you to check out 17th district. I think there is some potential Drakonid on Drakonid violence, and you know how they get. Im not supposed to tell you this, but the chief, he said he’s tired of sending his people down there, and you know I don’t blame him, but if hes not gonne then people are gonna be looking at me all like, oh, you never do anything for us, and im just so tired. Go check it out, kill the bad ones, but don’t be too loud. Im going to a meeting but text me if anything. You should be alright tho. I got the utmost confidence in ya.” Jay logged out of the simulacrum and disconnected his headset. He yawned a bit to really feel the fatigue accelerate his healing, as his skin grew back across the hole in the back of his head. Most people got ports surgically installed to make the process less macabre; but the cord was self-cleaning, and moreover Jay liked the pain. It was such a unique sensation: the piercing of flesh; the crushing of bone; the shock as the virtual nanites fluctuated between existence and non-existence to rip your consciousness halfway between flesh and Abyss. Jay stretched and began to listlessly put on his clothes. It was time to get to work. Stepping into the sunlight from the dungeon that was his dorm room was always a bracing process, and Jay strained his eyes to adjust. He looked down at his black hoodie, black jeans, and black boots. *I’m literally some goth kid’s fan fiction.* Jay put on his sunglasses and began to jog to the nearest fast-travel station. The ones on campus connected him to any terminal in the city, and already his glasses were calculating and simulating the shortest possible route with respect to his physical condition; in his case, it kept trying to send him straight forward, across stairs and tables like some obsessive parkour enthusiast. Jay refused to let the fun of such a path tempt him: he had a job to do, and it was best to not draw attention to oneself. There was the usual congestion of Sentis going to and from the terminal, and Jay struggled to maneuver into the lines set aside for bipeds. There he stood, smothered between someone with a horse’s head, someone covered in wooly fur, and the overbearing stench of mammal. Jay sighed. It probably wouldn’t be so congested if you didn’t have to pay every time you went somewhere. But if rich, then pay. Those 20 “Great” Laws never failed to assert themselves, intruding in every little aspect of daily life. And what was so great about them in the first place? The 20 Laws of Mirrim, the first comprehensive attempt to codify sentient behavior. Jay ran through them instinctively in his head, almost as a prayer. 1. If hungry, then eat. 2. If tired, then rest. 3. If scared, then flee. 4. If angry, then fight. 5. If happy, then share. 6. If sad, then mourn. 7. If stupid, then learn. 8. If smart, then teach. 9. If hurt, then heal. 10. If living, then feel. 11. If known, then real. 12. If poor, then work. 13. If rich, then pay. 14. If weak, then train. 15. If strong then prove. 16. If lost, then find. 17. If fertile, then grow. 18. If broken, then fix. 19. If correct, then obey. 20. If wrong, then defy. Jay was most certainly not logically critical of the Laws; for they were born of the highest caliber of mathematical and metaphysical proof. Jay never imagined in any way that he could ever find a flaw or blemish within them, as their rigor bears mountains of empirical and subjective evidence. It was in his tumultuous emotions where Jay felt his disillusionment with the Laws. They were always the first and the last, the command and the justification, and the bitter simplicity were chains that compelled Jay to comply. The Domes loomed oppressively overhead, and the false sunlight, calculated and processed and filtered for perfection, powered a fractal of illusion. And so, when Jay arrived at 17th District, and his sunglasses instantly updated with details of his mission, the thought that he was simply a video game character responding to the inputs of some omnipresent observer that transcended his understanding overcame him, and his anxiety and depression flared to their peaks. Their presence made Jay smile. His anxiety often anticipated threats beyond the limits of his rational ability, and he found himself reliant on his intuitive sensations of the waves of fear he could feel. His depression was the bedrock of his power: the high levels of Truth necessary to conduct Dey nigh-required suicidal levels of Despair, which Jay drank in. He jogged leisurely along the path his sunglasses bid he follow, and as he began to get closer to his destination, he could feel waves of foreign bloodlust blow past him. He channeled his fear into Resolve, and his clothes responded to his directed willpower by beginning to bend the light around him. *Stealth Mode activated.* The apartment complexes were nicer than his dorms at Paladin Academy, and Jay felt a twinge of Envy surge forth. He cautiously hopped the white metal fence and made his way inside, orienting himself towards the greatest density of bloodlust. Suddenly, an explosion! An apartment above him expelled fire with a tremendous fury, and Jay broke out into a sprint towards the source of the bloodlust inside. He quickly scaled the stairs by running vertically up the side, hoisting his cloaked body over the burning rail, and dashing into the smoldering room to see a red Drakonid, crying wildly in the corner, smoke coming out of her eyes, lashing her tail at what appeared to be a murderous mate, his eyes hungrily fixated on a fearful green offspring. The flames all about were just beginning to really spread, and so there was an awkward sense of needing to evacuate and resolving this situation. “I won’t let you eat my child!” The sight of the green male Drakonid dominating the red immediately filled Jay with an explosive and violent rage. His bloodlust was immediately sensed by the green Drakonid, who wheeled around to be viciously kicked across the room by a jumping roundhouse kick. The green Drakonid angrily picked itself up from the smoldering bookshelf it was knocked into and began inhaling deeply. “I’ve got your scent, mammal! I’ll eat you first!” Locking on to the smoke fluttering peculiarly around Jay, the green Drakonid lunged forward, which Jay intercepted with a precise axe kick that hit him twice: first a vicious blow to the bottom of his jaw, and then a merciless stomp towards his chest that sent him back into the bookshelf. The sunglasses analyzed him and reported that he was dead. *Such a shame. That was barely a fight.* Jay disengaged his stealth. Exhaling deeply to relax, he began channeling his Dey into the air in the room, suppressing the fires and blowing out the smoke. Then he turned his attention to the red Drakonid still huddled around its child in the corner. “Are you okay? I’m responding to reports of elevated bloodlust in this vicinity. Can you explain what’s going on?” “I didn’t ask to be saved by some monkey. Leave me alone!” That was fair, even if it stung. Jay shrugged and walked over to the green Drakonid, now a corpse. Blood oozed from its broken jaw, and its organs were slowly beginning to spill from its caved chest. Jay’s Greed told him there was something worth taking on his body, and his faith was rewarded as he looted an expensive looking dagger. The curved blade shined from a bejeweled golden hilt, and Jay stashed it away to sell later. Overall, this mission was a wash, some humdrum conflict resolution. The Drakonid is probably rich enough to afford resurrection insurance and will be back on the streets before you know it. Jay sometimes bemused that this was society’s grind, that feature by which everyone can level up. All your enemies respawn later, and everyone’s experience grows. As Jay left the faintly smoky apartment, he could see Sentis beginning to crowd around and lookey loo to see just what all the hubbub and fuss was about. Jay could sense the generalized atmosphere of disgust and contempt for him, could almost hear the echoes of the thoughts driving the intense emotional disdain. Jay jogged away with a bit of urgency, only slowing down to a casual pace when the terminal was back in sight. It always seemed to take more time to go to a mission than it did to get home. Jay never quite could figure it out. The Theory of Temporal Malleability, although explained to him many times, seemed to break all intuitive notions; yet he knew it was real, as real any of the other theories the many races of sentient organizations of Life have discovered and cultivated. In any case, Jay was back in his dorm room before he knew it. He was no longer in any mood to study. Something was bothering him and had been since the mission. *Ah yes, the racism. I’m upset because of the racism. That’s the thing.* Jay took a moment to lay down on the bed and fully let the misery wash over him. In his general day-to-day, Jay’s Mind could keep the venom at bay; but in his solitude, Jay’s Despair insisted upon itself. *There is no absolute meaning of anything. Your life is worthless. Kill yourself and everyone around you.* There it was, Jay’s nemesis. The Anti-Life Equation. It was early in life wherein Jay realized that some external Force that posed as an internal one was assaulting him mentally, poisoning his emotions and sapping his willpower. He immediately had begun building complex mental walls to keep the Force at bay, but it always seemed to find him, creeping up from the dark recesses of his Mind to orient him towards Despair. He had deduced many things about it. For one thing: it appeared to affect every living thing. Jay’s empathy was almost constantly overwhelmed by the background misery permeating all existence, feeling the suffering of all sentient beings as they toiled in fragile ignorance. It represented intelligence beyond intelligence, predicting and compensating for all attempts at defiance and contradiction. Jay noted personally that whatever Anti-Life was, it sought to change his identity such that he would immediately agree with and identify with the train of thought it inspired. The only thing keeping him one step ahead was Jay’s obsessive need to categorize and define everything, including his identity. One day, he noticed that all of the negative thoughts he had were in the second-person, as if it were someone watching and commenting on Jay’s first-person dialogue. When he began to consciously gas himself up, starting back to when he first mastered Pride, he realized that all of his self-generated dialogues had “I” or “me” as the subject, except when they seemed maliciously imposed upon him, in which case it was a general “You.” *You should obtain ultimate Power and burn these Domes to the ground.* This was the first time Anti-Life had ever suggested something worth devoting mental energy to. What an exciting thought. Jay never dismissed anything off-hand, neither the hyperrational nor the asinine; you never know when some snide comment will be made relevant by the overall plot. Jay always acknowledged whatever glitchy new data seemed to demand attention, as to build a better mental model of the arbitrary world he lived in. Jay never could discern his place in the general plot of life; but as most of his internal dialogue was negative, he had resigned himself to believing he was a villain of some kind, infiltrating the heroes for some arcane plot, waiting for the opportune time to betray them. The paradox was that he never seemed to find any heroes: it was villains all the way down. And if he was to be a villain, why not the best? Although Jay figured that this was all a trap, a function of Anti-Life that compelled reverence and submission, Jay yearned to know Anti-Life intimately. What was it, what did it want? Was it alive, or dead, or something beyond? Could it be mastered? If stupid, then learn. Jay lay on his bed and allowed the torrent of emotions to wash over him, analyzing each one in turn and either dismissing it or adding it to his ever-changing models of Reality. Something was missing, something was begging to fill the yawning Void in Jay’s Mind. Jay had not noticed that his eyes were tightly closed, and that his breathing was beginning to slow; but suddenly he was asleep and made instantly aware by his ring. The landscape was amorphous abstraction, different colors shifting and blending into transcendental shapes. Jay could feel that his consciousness was being pulled somewhere, higher and higher, until he broke through the nebulous ether and was confronted with absolute Nothingness, which began to congeal and conform into a titanic Ape with piercing green eyes and dark brown fur covering its mighty body. Ivory horns curled from its head, and its ears ended in sharp angles upwards. The Ape extended a massive hand and scooped up Jay, who was paralyzed. *Someone’s in my Dreamscape.* The thought filled Jay with dread, and he looked around nervously as other massive Apes began forming from the infinite Nothingness extending in all directions. Chairs began forming under them, and suddenly they were all in a room, a King’s Court, with the Ape holding Jay sitting idly on the throne. “Mirrim sends his regards.” Although the Ape opened its mouth, it did not move as if to form words, but emitted a guttural roar that seemed to inject meaning directly into Jay’s Mind. The pain was overwhelming, and Jay began screaming internally under the vast pressure building in his head. The other Apes began to roar in turn, each beginning an entirely new but related train of thought. “Soul begets Power. Power crafts Reality.” “Dominate all those in your way.” “Cause that which is Inevitable.” The tumultuous cacophony began to drown its own meaning out, merging raw emotion with intent and becoming the pure essence of communication, and Jay felt as if he were falling from impossible heights through a maddening symphony of Desire. And then Jay woke up, covered in sweat, his tail curled desperately around his leg in terror. Well, okay then. The Old Gods have spoken, probably. Jay sighed and figured this was as good a goal as any other in this world, and so quietly Resolved to destroy the Domes. He had been making things up as he went along his whole life; and honestly, he’d never been much of a fan of the Domes. The weakness of their leaders and the contradictions within their ideologies frustrated Jay to no end; and what fun would it be to tear down that festering status quo? Jay smiled to himself in the dark. The best villains always have a strong personal philosophy, and this new one seemed hip, fresh, and really all that. Jay could imagine the adoration, as crowds of supporters fell over themselves to justify and protect him, going at his command to…what exactly? And suddenly the daydream popped, and Jay was again alone in his room. He shook his head to himself. He knew he barely believed in this new Quest, that it was the machinations of the Immortals who bid him even Desire such frivolous destruction. He also knew that he barely believed in anything at all, other than that he was a barely observable spec in an absurd and unamused Cosmos. If it were to take him closer to the mysteries of Anti-Life and those who wielded it, he would accept this call to action; but it was a casual acceptance, rather than the gung-ho enthusiasm Jay felt that true devotion to Ideals inspires. Jay felt like nothing more than a marionette, hollow and unsentient; not a Senti. And so the paradox of Jay, alternating wildly between conviction and nihilism, Resolved to bring about the end to the era of the Domes.",
784,"RoomMy name is Greg and something will compel me to commit suicide in my girlfriend's apartment. I do it in her bedroom, in front of the vanity with the large oval mirror. It happens sometime during the day, because there's sunlight coming through the window. Probably on a weekday. I don't think it's a weekend because it's too quiet. If it were a day when most folks were home, I'd hear children playing or a neighbor walking a dog. There's no noise outside when I kill myself. I sit and face the mirror. Upright with shoulders square and back. My face is expressionless and mannequin still. I'll be in a blue polo shirt and have an excellent haircut. It feels like I'm in jeans based on the feel of the fabric against my thighs. I think my feet are in a pair of shoes. Whenever I experience this memory or vision, or whatever you want to call it, I never look down. And the mirror only shows me my upper body. This has always bothered me, as I want to know exactly what I'm wearing on my last day on Earth. Owning those clothes, recognizing when I've put on the right combination of shirt and pants might give me an early warning when it's about to happen. Behind me is a full-size twin bed with a cheap pink comforter. It's pressed into the corner of the room, so that you can only get out of the bed on the right side. The bedframe is painted white with gray metal exposed by scratches on the headboard. The posts are topped with round, shiny, bronze caps. There's a window to the left of the headboard. A couple feet from the end of the bed, there's a white dresser facing the mirror. It's wide, and not all of it fits in the reflection. All the walls are cheap, apartment, primer white. My eyes are locked on my face's reflection. I reach for a black, semi-automatic pistol resting on the corner of the vanity top. It's not mine. I don't recognize the gun, nor could I tell you the make, model, or caliber. I've avoided everything to do with firearms my whole adult life. Maybe I can avoid this if I never own a handgun. I pick up the weapon with my right hand in a calm steady motion. I put it to my head. I press the muzzle against the space between my temple and ear. My grip is firm and the rest of my body is motionless. The barrel is held so straight that I'm certain it's absolutely level with the floor. You could balance something on top of it, on top of me. My eyes close. My world becomes nothing but silence and pressure. Gravity pushes my feet against the soles of my shoes. The chair presses back against my thighs, ass, and back. Metal presses through my hair at the side of my head. My hand wrapped around the handle. My right index finger pressed against the trigger. And the pressure increases. My knuckles tighten and pull - and that's all there is to it. It's not a dream, but it has that reconstructed remembered feeling. Like I know there are cosmetics on the vanity, but it's just a cluster of jars. I don't know what they are or how many. I just know they're there. I don't recall if there's a pocket on my shirt or if you can see a logo. Sometimes details feel clearer, and other times it's all very blurry. Oddly enough, it has never invaded or disrupted my sleep. It's just there when I'm awake, and I only think about it when I'm very quiet or bored. It just drifts into the thought space like a floater in my eyeball. That's when I first ""remembered"" the suicide. I was in my 8th grade algebra class. The teacher was speaking and I was spacing out the window at an overcast sky. That's when I noticed the floater. A slight smear in my peripheral, forever drifting off to the left. I was chasing it with my eye and attempting to hold it in focus when the whole thing entered my head. My first reaction wasn't fear. You'd think something like that is terrifying, but my reaction is better described as agitated, disturbed, or unsettled. It's a lot for a 12 year old to process; seeing an older version of yourself in an unknown woman's room. Knowing the sensation of putting the gun to your head. Pulling the trigger. Knowing that you will be cold and unfeeling when you do it. I never told anyone. Not my best friend, not my brother, not my parents. It was all I could think about for a long time. My grades suffered. I was moody, rebellious, and mean. But I probably didn't seem much different from any boy going through puberty. By the time I was a sophomore, I thought less about the misplaced memory and more about making the soccer team, getting my driving permit, and girls. I rationalized the whole thing as a gruesome day dream. I resolved to get on with life. I avoided mirrors, guns, and going back to a girlfriend's place (or even her dorm room). By the time I graduated college and got my first job, I wasn't thinking about suicide at all. I even had a few blue polos in my wardrobe and had stopped intentionally seeking out the cheapest, worst barber I could find to cut my hair. When I was 26, I met Josie. I was working in the corporate office of a bank downtown and she was finishing up her bachelor's degree. We're the same age, but she'd taken a few ""break years"" to travel and volunteer before enrolling in university. She's been to five out of seven continents, speaks fluent Spanish, some French, and Portuguese. Despite being an undergrad, she's more worldly than most people. I never stood a chance. My brain brought up vocabulary I never really used. Words like ""enamored"", ""cherish"", ""complement"". After a year of dating, I was thinking about buying a ring. It was at that time she asked me to come see a ""surprise"" and texted me an address. I thought we were going to try a new restaurant and was surprised the GPS brought me to an apartment building. Josie wanted us to get a place together. We met in the parking lot and followed a leasing agent up a flight of stairs to look at a unit. Josie hung on my arm as we toured the 1100 or so square feet. She whispered to me as we inspected each area. She said ""ooo, look at OUR nice kitchen,"" and ""check out OUR living room."" All happiness and giggles. The leasing agent was pleased with our enthusiasm, but acted as if she didn't notice. She calmly explained the ideal location. The building is just 5 minutes from the light rail and just down the street from Josie and I's favorite brunch spot. The rent was reasonable, and would become even more affordable in two days when Josie received an offer for a job. I loved the apartment and was overwhelmed by the gesture. Most girls just ask if you want to move in together. Josie surprises you by finding the perfect spot and taking you there. Except for the bedroom. It had the vanity. It was a feature of the apartment, with the large oval mirror and counter top built directly into the wall. Josie nearly squealed with glee when she saw it. She dropped my arm at the threshold and walked straight up to the mirror. She ran her hands around the edge of the vanity top, imagining how nicely it would accommodate all her girly things. My stomach tightened. My skin prickled and puckered as if I'd stepped into the cold. Sweat seeped from my pores. My heart slammed in my ears. I excused myself to the bathroom and shut the door. Waves of nausea knocked me to the floor. I pulled myself up by the rim of the toilet bowl, raised the lid and prepared to vomit. I tried not to think about it. I tried not to think about the mirror's size and shape. I tried not to think about that cheap, white primer on the walls. That the window was in the right place. The vomiting started. I heaved until my stomach was empty and sour, yellow bile came up my throat. I heaved until nothing was left and my nose ran and eyes watered. Josie and the leasing agent both knocked on the door to ask if I was alright. I flushed and backed away from the bowl, sitting on the empty bathroom floor with my back against the wall. ""Give me a minute,"" I managed to croak and pulled myself together. I rinsed my face and palmed some water from the faucet to my lips. There was of course no towel in that unfurnished, barren space, so I made do with my shirt and slacks. I looked in the mirror to see if I recognized the man staring back. The face staring back looked younger than the man who blows out his brains in that little bedroom. I managed a smile and ran my hands through a not so perfect haircut and appreciated my white, short-sleeved button down and khakis. ""That's the space,"" I thought. ""But today is not the day."" I exited the bathroom and apologized to the leasing agent. Josie had been concerned while I was bonded to the toilet bowl, but the compassion was fading and being replaced by frustration and confusion. I took both her hands in mine, looked her in the eyes, and said ""I'm not ready"". She pulled her hands away and stared down at them. I just walked away. Went back to my car, and drove back to my less than stellar and not as conveniently located apartment. I didn't call Josie the next day and she didn't contact me. We were silent another day. Then another. A week went by and a week more. It was almost two months before we saw each other again. She'd started her new job in a building not far from my office. We ran into each other on the street after work. She walked right up to me and apologized. She barely got a word out of her mouth before her composure broke down. She stood there staring, hands clenched at her sides, trying to hold back the tears. I put my arms around her and she pressed her face against my chest. She just leaned into me and sobbed. I told her she had nothing to be sorry about. That I was the asshole for getting scared so easily. And I meant it. I'd hurt someone special and all over a stupid daydream I'd had as a child. I told myself that I could beat the damn room. Josie came over most of that week and we had brunch at our favorite spot on the weekend. After we ate, she timidly asked if I would like to see her new place. I knew by the way she asked and how she said it was just around the street that she was talking about that same apartment. Even though I walked out, she'd rented it anyway. I suppressed the dread and followed her. Josie had lived in the dorm during her undergrad and I'd never seen her furniture. It included a white, metal bed frame and a white dresser. But I wasn't about to let the fear ruin my life. I continued to cope. Fortunately, a full-size twin is a bit small for us, and when I stayed over I could get away with spending the night on the couch. I told myself I was safe as long as I was smart about it. I never needed a white noise machine, but I got one to ""help me sleep"" so the apartment would always have some background noise. I tried to have music playing in the background during the day. I avoided being alone in the bedroom as much as possible. I vowed never to sit at the vanity. I vowed never to stare into the vanity mirror. I vowed never to own a gun. I vowed never to wear a blue polo in Josie's apartment. I vowed never to wear jeans in Josie's apartment. I always took my shoes off when I entered the door. I started to talk to Josie about getting a bigger bed for the two of us. I started to look for other apartments where we could move in together. I've been smart. I've been happy. And I've mostly stopped worrying about that misplaced memory. And the practical necessity of everyday normalcy has begun to wear out the caution. The wardrobe restrictions were the first to go, and the white noise machine wasn't really helping Josie or I get to sleep. I let the lease run out on my old apartment and moved in with Josie thinking it would be temporary, but I haven't found anything that beats the price or location. We're saving up for the new bed, but it will be a while before we can get the one we have an eye on. Josie got a promotion and we work different schedules. I'm home on my own more frequently. When that happens, I try to stay in the living room and occupy myself, but inevitably I get up to visit the bathroom or the kitchen. On the way I'll pause in front of the bedroom door and look at the vanity. Sometimes I'll even walk in and pull out the chair. I haven't sat down yet - but I want to. A few days ago I went rummaging through Josie's things and I found the gun. It stays unloaded, the magazine and the pistol are in an empty shoe box in the closet. I think she got it for protection when she was living on her own. But she knows how I feel about guns, and I guess that's why she's never said anything. Every day that face in the mirror gets a little older and a little more familiar. It's just a weird daydream. I love Josie and I'm really happy - but I can't stop thinking about that damn memory. Maybe the best way to get over this is to face it head on. Take a day off. Load the gun. Put it on the vanity. Sit in that chair. Prove to myself that there's nothing to this stupid room. See if I can't get back up and put the gun away.",

I made the mistake of being honest about PTSD with my boss, hello blackballed, goodbye house and 6 figures, hello struggling just to afford to eat while my abusers are beyond wealthy from family money, yeah, the black sheep, the victim, gets nothing. I’m not envious though. I’ll take my freedom, even if it means homelessness after working so damn hard. I wish I were very young again and oblivious, and just blaming myself, instead of realizing how many ppl hurt me, neglected and abandoned me, and now expect me to go to a Christmas party like that shit never happened, they think bc I don’t verbally eviscerate them, that I’m that same small, scared kid that won’t say anything. No one wants to listen me explain the amygdala and limbic system. When parents, grandparents and siblings can just ignore the one that got almost all the abuse, every kind, for more yrs than I can count. I know they’d like to just call me insane so they don’t have to be held accountable for their actions, or inaction. The only option “egg donor” offered me was to let her know if there’s a place to lock me up, a place like Dr Phil has. OMG! I must be adopted, maybe she’s senile, nope, just the same as she always was, but I couldn’t allow my younger self to acknowledge that a mother could actually want to harm and neglect their own child, and actually ENJOYS it. It’s actually chilling, that’s why my little brain couldn’t handle it. I’d love to see my PET scan, what’s left of my brain. The brain my Ivy Leagued trained psychiatrist says is broken. Freaking idiot! Great way to explain it to a patient. Tells me “U just gotta let go of it, your brain’s broken”, just keep taking these addictive sleeping pills and benzos so I can pay my student debt and never even ask u about any real issues, just take your prescriptions, don’t ask about side effects of the efficacy of it. I gently tried to explain Dr Bessel Van Der Kolk’s work, or why I shouldn’t be on high doses of Benadryl for years too. I guess have to do YOUR job too, doctor, plus teach u! I’ve already had to raise myself, then two kids alone. No idea why I’m frustrated and burnt out! Either way, screw them all. Too stupid to mistake my kindness as weakness. Well, this inner child is as healed as she’s gonna get. I’m just trying to contain my frustration at all of them and the whole damn world about now. Regardless of how much I can know the abuse wasn’t, and isn’t my fault, I did, and still do, the very best I can at everything, gotta be a perfectionist. Maybe if I’m good enough.... I’m just done. I’m too exhausted from deciphering this mess called my life, then trying to get anyone to care, help me, listen or even just help themselves. I decided yesterday. I’m sick of fighting for my recovery alone, suffering continued abuse, living with triggers on the daily. I’m not gonna kill myself. That would actually be quit easy. I’ve attempted before and dealt with the aftermath of my father’s suicide. I don’t have that option bc the one, singular person that cares and understands any of this, and is suffering already too, would then also likely do the same. I’ve seen it. They can fall like dominoes. I had two other relatives commit suicide shortly after the other.(with the same gun) Often it’s precisely those of us that have been hurt the most have, end up with the most empathy, it can actually be too much of a good thing, imo. We pick up on everything. Feel everything. Hypervigilance just gets overwhelming, like a soldier tired of being on patrol 24/7 for decades. Family doesn’t care, doctors don’t care, insurance doesn’t care, employer didn’t care, community doesn’t care, no support groups, no “friends “ offer, police don’t care. I literally just tried yesterday (I know I’m triggered atm) to warn TWO separate state troopers at TWO barracks, including a corporal, of a serial pedophile. They had me tell my story of sexual abuse in the goddamn lobby, in front of ppl, standing up, didn’t even ask his name, not even when I told of other ppl I strongly suspected(easy to track...his own kids! I’m their cousin! God damn! And I’m not using that the wrong way, forgive me, but there is evil.). They would also be victims within the statue of limitations. They couldn’t even answer if I was allowed to record an in person conversation. Literally said, “What do u want me to do about it?”. Neither knew, neither cared, and this is a pretty rural/suburban area. They weren’t doing anything else.(I’m definitely not hating on law enforcement, I’ve got family members in blue too, I respect them, although I left with a bad taste in my mouth). They also had me wait for them seated beside, and had me tell my story of abuse, in front of a guy there updating his Megan’s Law paperwork, they KNEW him! It’s that small of a town, joking and laughing with him. I could feel my anger build, somehow me trying to protect my little self, finally speak my truth with the sole intent that no matter how embarrassing and emotionally draining it was, I HAD to at least TRY to protect other children. Unfortunately, I got the outcome my continually self blaming, deflated belief that justice or karma exists, mind told me. Even the criminal said to me, “Nah, that’s not right! I would never even mess with kids that young!” An actual sex offender was the ONLY one to give me ANY sympathy. Even more than my own mother. I wouldn’t believe this story either if I didn’t live it. Am I living in some different universe? How do ppl not realize??? Did I mention that my abuser was a male relative, I knew his history well, and told them that he drove a school bus for years and years, even though he was highly skilled in another line of work, neighbors came forward saying they’ve know for decades. The police didn’t care one single bit to even listen, I could barely get a sentence in, rolling their eyes. And this was me, after possessing everything I had in me to speak my truth, keeping my composure, dressed like a well respected, educated, middle class adult. No wonder kids don’t say anything! I thought I could save other kids from the hell I’m living. I can’t. I tried. Did I mention this is Jerry Sandusky’s home state? Oh, just two hrs down the road. And two hrs the other way we had one of the largest Catholic Church scandals. Ppl really learned from all that, huh? I’ll never find the closure that I’d like. I’ve never allowed myself anger, but it’s coming. Possibly a good sign, yet it feels, not good, my anger is trapped. What can I do now? They’ve(there were a couple abusers) all ruined my life. Game over, they win, even if they’re all too intellectually, ethically and emotionally incapable of understanding. I’m done banging my head against the wall. I accept the fact that no one cares about anyone else, I should say very, very few. Our culture just further encourages narcissistic behavior and it makes me terrified for the future. I’ve faced this demon CPTSD almost every day of my life, have evidence of numerous crimes committed against me as a child, and as an adult, which I understood the statute of limitations, which neither trooper did, fyi. I recently testified(via phone or I would have full blown dissociated and/or had a panic attack) in front of our state senate to change the law. Glad I did, so maybe 3 freaking generations from now ppl will finally catch on to how damaging trauma is and our country is having a mental health crisis. They think opioid abuse is the problem. No, it’s the result of ppl that are in pain, trying to self medicate in this country where suicide has increased 40% in 17 yrs. I’m just too tired to constantly try to solve my problems, my family’s and trying to understand our society. I feel like Sisyphus trying to keep pushing that bolder up the hill. It just keeps rolling back. Even heavier, the more I understand all of my abuse and sickness around me, the more my hands sweat and slip off of that boulder. I’m too damn tired. If it rolls over me, I honestly don’t care anymore.",
786,"Andrew Gosden and cases that remind me of himMost people on the sub are familiar with the Andrew Gosden case. On the morning of 14 September 2007, 14-year-old Andrew who lived with his parents and sister in Doncaster, England, left his home on the pretense of leaving for school. Instead he went to a nearby park where he waited for his family to leave for their jobs at which time he returned home, packed a bag with a few items and left to walk to Doncaster railway station where he boarded a train to London, never to return again. My initial instinct when I first read about the case was that he must have committed suicide. Two things that made me skeptical was why he would go all the way to London and why his body has been missing all this time. I’ve often thought about the case and throughout the years, I’ve been reminded of Andrew when I stumbled upon other cases of teenagers disappearing. I’d like to list a few of the reasons why I still believe he committed suicide. Yes, the fact that he didn’t take his charger or didn’t get the round ticket plays into that. But for me it’s a bit more than that. 1. Lots of teenagers commit suicide. Andrew was a smart and apparently brooding and sensitive child who liked to listen to relatively intense music. As far as his personality goes, I think he can fit the suicidal teenager profile if such a thing exists. He was also reported to have started reading Nietzsche, which seems like a contrast with books he had been known to read before. I’m speculating here but growing up in a religious home he may have been dealing with a crisis of faith. We know he had also stopped going to church. His parents also reported that he had become more withdrawn preceding his disappearance. 2. The fact that he went to London might be the very reason his body has never been found. I feel like it was important for Andrew to commit suicide somewhere far away from home and make things at home as normal as possible for as long as he could. I also think it was important for him to do it somewhere far away and separate from his family. While I’ve never been in the position, I feel like a major part of deciding to commit suicide is dealing with the thought of the people you leave behind. Although I understand that not knowing is probably much more agonizing to the family than knowing and reaching closure; I also feel like Andrew must have dreaded the thought of his family who I think he really did love, knowing this side of him or finding his body. Andrew probably though that in London, he’d be able to kill himself and disappear. 3. To me suicide is the simplest scenario. Andrew leaving for London for mundane reasons like a concert and then meeting a nefarious fate with his body also never being found seems like an unlikely coincidence. What are the odds that on the one occasion that he planned to ditch school and have some fun, a predator spots him and manages to bring him to harm and then goes out of his way to hide the body? Probably not that low but again it’s a bunch of things happening at once whereas I think a planned suicide with the intention of disappearing does not require any coincidences. I also find it hard to believe a rather goody-tow-shoes kid like Andrew would deceive his parents for such a small thing such as a concert when he probably could have done that at a more appropriate time with the knowledge and permission of his parents. And him planning a rendezvous with a predator seems unlikely as well since he appears to have been a rather isolated child and had no real way of developing a secret relationship with somebody. Keep in mind that he had no internet at home and the police searched all the school and library computers and found nothing and he also had no online gaming profiles. I also think as far as his personality goes; he doesn’t appear to be the type to be interested in a secret relationship with somebody. When he lost his phone, he opted not to have it replaced. 4. I think he would have eventually either returned or been found if he had left to start a new life. A 14-year-old not very street-smart kid managing to pull off such a thing seems unlikely. And I think after hearing all the pleas from his family he would have made contact with them had he been out there. 5. I’m going to name some other cases that have reminded me of Andrew and have made me feel like suicide not only fits this scenario but also appears to be the best answer: **Annie McCann:** A 16-year old girl, who appeared to have been a good and well-mannered girl and was also reported to be a homebody. She also skipped school, grabbed a few items and left home. She did however leave a note saying she had contemplated suicide but had settled on leaving home and starting a new life. Her body was later found. There is debate on whether or not her death was homicide, an accident or suicide. **Devin Bond:** a 16-year-old well-mannered teenager whose case was featured on the Vanished podcast and whose remains appear to have just been found after 2 years. He disappeared from his home in the early morning hours. While details are still pending, he appears to have taken with him one of his father’s guns. It seems that he made his way to a wooded area 6 or 7 miles from his home where he committed suicide. He had occasionally talked of suicide with his friends. What reminded me of Andrew about this case was the fact that Devin made sure to arrange his pillows in a way that made it seem like he was still in bed. It reminded me of how Andrew tossed his uniform in the washing machine and arranged the rest of his clothes the way he normally would. Also, the fact that Devin made sure to go to an inaccessible area away from his home reminded me of Andrew. He was also reported by his mother to be playing video games in his room the night before when she said good night to him and retired to bed. It was a bit strange for me that Andrew was calmly playing video games on the train if he was indeed on his way to suicide, but Devin’s case changed my mind. **James Candy:** a 17-year-old Canadian teenager, also featured on the Vanished, left his home in the middle of night and took only a lariat with him. While he did leave a suicide note in his room for his parents, his remains have never been found. I feel like he could have killed himself somewhere nearby if he wanted, maybe in the family barn. But the fact that despite searches his remains have not been found makes me feel like it was important for him to do this somewhere far away and separate. Not going to make this post any longer; but sadly, I believe Andrew left to kill himself. My intention of mentioning the other cases was to show that some teenagers may feel a need to commit suicide somewhere far away from the eyes of the adults in their lives. And that may be the very reason Andrew left for London and also the reason why his body has not been found. It’s unlikely but he may have not been sure at first and may have wanted to test the waters a little, be on the streets for a while, see if he could start a new life (like Annie McCann). Or he may have wanted to enjoy London, a city he reportedly liked, one last time. Either way, I think he eventually killed himself soon after. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Andrew_Gosden http://philosophyofcrime.com/what-really-happened-to-annie-mccann/ http://www.thevanishedpodcast.com/episodes/2019/3/17/episode-167-james-candy http://www.thevanishedpodcast.com/episodes/2017/9/13/episode-91-devin-bond https://www.dnj.com/story/news/2019/11/13/devin-bond-search-remains-found-murfreesboro/4182413002/",
787,"[PI] There has been a murder, the entire house has been locked down, all the guests are now suspects, and you're a yet-to-be discovered burglar who was just trying to make a quick buck.The original post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/elbmk9/wp_there_has_been_a_murder_the_entire_house_has/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) This prompt was made a few days back, but I wanted to share the whole story I cooked up here. Hope you enjoy it. —-—------—--——-----¯--___---_____-_-----____—---—-- “There are only 15 people on this island! Get a grip Rachel!” The man that finally managed to approach the girl shouted those words, making everyone else in the room that surrounded her back off a bit. Not because he was there to protect her, but that he would take the blame if anything were to happen to her. “But… I saw it... ” Even from where I was hiding, the sound of the slap upon the girl’s cheeks reverberated enough to send a shiver down my spine. “Arthur!” “She’s lying! One of you… one of you killed Amanda… and I am not going to let anyone of you get away with this.” His low murmuring was more than intimidating, the glint of bloodlust in his eyes making him indiscernible from an animal. “None of you are getting out. I am the one that has the keys to the boat.” “What are you…?” “Everyone will remain. If you don’t like this take it.” He flaunted the keys in front of everyone. “If you do it...” he pointed the short rifle he had to the closest person that possessed any threat, a young man that seemed to be ready to jump on him at any second. “... then you are the killer. Why else would you do this, right?” “Arthur...” Rachel looked up at the man that she must have barely recognized as the one that had been so kind the day before. I know… I saw him as he gently patted her head and played with her. “Do you think-” Before the young man could say anything more, a man in his 40s placed a hand on his shoulder. “It’s a typhoon. No one can get to the mainland anyway. No matter if they have the keys or not. Right, Arthur?” The man that stopped the angry kid from doing something stupid stepped forward. The doctor. “What are you getting at with this game? You want to blame someone here that badly? You want to blame one of your family members of murder?” “Family? The part of your family that tied me to you had already died! I have no more ties with you people.” With those last words, Arthur distanced himself from the rest of the people and went outside. “Are you alright Rachel?” Some woman that I could only assume to be her mother, approached the girl. I would have liked to stay a bit more and listen in, but someone made their way upstairs after that confrontation and I don’t like the idea of being found out that easily. In this situation, this means nothing less than death. Hiding in the balcony overseeing the main entrance wasn’t a bad idea, more so with all the expensive plants around that could hide my body, but I couldn’t stay there for more. The old geezer is right. I can’t get out of here. Heck, every entrance is guarded by someone. They are set on believing it’s someone from the outside that made that crime… but it would be impossible. There isn’t anyone else other than me. I made sure of it. Not to mention… the fact that 4 people were already murdered wasn’t a joke. Someone must have planned this from the start. There is no way to do something like this while surrounded by people without some sort of plan. Could they have predicted that I would be here as well? That’s why everyone is staying watch, trying to blame me? Damn… All I wanted was some quick cash… but… “Like hell you’re going to catch me… No. I’m going to catch you.” That’s the only option. To find the real killer and bring them to justice all the while not being seen by anyone. That’s the only way I can survive. For the moment, I hid in one of the rooms with the bodies. It’s creepy as hell, but they won’t come here anytime soon. Now… Let me think through the events that transpired until now. 15th of August, everyone arrives at the island, including me. There are another 15 people besides me in the mansion. They have their own individual rooms, but there are those that came here with a partner. Those have a shared bedroom. The children, even though the youngest one, the girl from before, is about 16 years old from what I heard, they too are staying in individual chambers. She is the one that saw me in the forest surrounding this place by chance. I didn’t think she would be walking alone in the rain at that time on the night. She was… smiling? I can only remember it vaguely, but she was smiling… that and her clothes… I can’t remember properly. I ran as soon as I saw her. I glanced at the body of the man on the bed. A large stake was driven through his heart. The people here want to leave the crime scene as it is, so I guess it’s as eerie as when they found it. There is no way a small girl like her can do something like this. Even for a grown woman… Wait… If the killer really drove this into their victim’s heart, what about the noise? Next to here is a normal chamber, right? One for servants if I’m not mistaken. I took a look over the blueprints for this place I found into the archive of one of the libraries in town, but I can’t be sure. Were they carried here? Or… Did that damn doctor say anything? Did he make a full investigation? Without having this kind of information really screws me over. I will keep this in mind, however. Next, the way the murders were made is just impossible. Each person was in one of the rooms. Not the one assigned to them, but a random one. Each of them had the key to one another. So, the first person had the key to the second room, the person in the second room had the key to the third and so on. They had to break a door to find out the first victim. Aaaaah, I don’t know shit. I don’t know if someone was lying or if all the exits were really secured. From what I can see in this room, it appears to be the case. The door was left unlocked now, but it’s sturdy enough and it doesn’t seem like anything is out of order here. The window is locked tight, probably remained the same. Then… the body. Is there something here that they might have missed? While it’s not what I had intended to do in this kind of situation, my life depended on it. I checked every pocket, but I couldn’t find anything. Hands too, were clean. Just as I was about to give up, I noticed something. “Hey… this shit...” There was a card in his breast pocket, one that most people would ignore… but I noticed a red spot on the fabric at the bottom of it, like some sort of liquid spilling inside. The card read “Thank you.” the bottom part of it being smeared with thick blood. What sort of killer leave a calling card? But the question was… how many of them were there? If I am to search every crime scene… that would take a lot of time. Not to mention that guy might have set something up for intruders in his wife’s room. Fucking hell. Just my luck. Part 2 I somehow managed to spend another day without getting caught. It will be midnight soon. I tried to reach every room with a dead body. I managed to get into another one before I almost got caught by that old servant, Peter. He was going around, locking all the rooms. It seems that there is a master key and he has it. I bet everyone has their own keys for their rooms, and the other rooms will remain locked. If anyone was snooping around they might get caught if any of the doors were knocked down. Pretty clever. I, however, managed to hide in the attic. There is no lock here, just dust and spiders. The rest of them seem to be in the dining area, I can hear a lot of noise from down there. Maybe another fight. Not that I care that much. The first body that I found was George, a servant. The second was Christina Hunberct, the wife of the cautious man from downstairs that fought back Arthur. Well, so it appeared from the picture on the nightstand. They must actually live here, while most of the others seem to have just arrived. She didn’t have anything on her… I wonder if… “Mother! How long do you plan on staying in your room?! Answer me!” That voice… I peeked through the small openings in between floorboards to see the hallway bellow me and sure enough, Rachel, the small girl from before, was yelling at a closed door. “Everyone is already starting to suspect each other… If you stay here, the blame will only shift on us! Mother!” Even as she pounded on the door, nothing happened, until her cries grew more and more desperate and she ran away, probably to get someone. This is bad… If there was another murder, I have to move out of here, and quick. With trained movements I walked down the stairs without making any sounds. I had already figured out what parts of the floorboards to avoid as well as which stairs creaked the loudest. After closing the attic, I walked the hallways. There was surely going to be a commotion and almost everyone will be at that door before soon. What I needed was another place to hide. Without thinking I started walking towards one of the rooms where the other corpses would be without actually thinking about the fact that they were locked. I jokingly rattled one of them, but to my surprise, it opened. “You’re… going to be kidding me...” There was nothing inside. No body, no blood, no nothing, as if nothing had happened. I checked the room and sure enough, it should have been the one where Amanda Hunberct was found. Why? Or rather, how? Rattling my brain, I glanced around the room and almost jumped out of my skin. On the side of the wall, there was a portrait of a man I didn’t see before. Since it was a close up, it was like he was looking at me through a window. Fucking… Who are you? Krauss Hunberct? I heard of him. The man that brought fortune on this family, right? So much so that people that marry the daughters of this family prefer to take their names rather than the other way around. There was an urban legend that said that he was actually a vampire… but he had already died last year. “Old bastard.” I tried to inspect the other rooms where bodies should have been in, but I found nothing. It seems that several people had the same idea as me and inspected the bodies, but only found what I did. Ah, I hid under the bed on several occasions. There was barely enough space to fit a person, but most people wouldn’t realize that. At first I tried to see if I could find the bodies stashed under there, but once I actually tried, I fit quite well under here. Perhaps because I was on the slimmer side. “Nothing here as well… Is this some kind of joke?” “Calm down Oscar. Don’t run off... We still don’t know if miss Amelia commited suicide or...” “It was a fucking murder. You’ve seen it, haven’t you? Can someone punch a stake into their own body?” Again with the stakes… It seems that these people are off their rocker. Or at least the murderer. “But… she was locked inside there, right? The key was on her desk and the windows were closed tight from the inside.” And now a closed room to boot. Perfect. “Yeah, I find that suspicious as well. There are no secret passages here as well. I know this place like the back of my palm since I was a kid. What is going on?” Aaaaaah. What a pain. I don’t want more people to die… it will make things harder for me if I’m caught… but it will be easier to move around, I guess. I need a place to rest as well. I haven’t slept for more than a day, but I can’t rest here. I might get locked inside. “You two! Have you found something?” “Nothing...” “Fucking bullshit. That and now Michael… he was found dead… outside. Someone seems to have impaled him on the fence.” Great… I can’t investigate that at all. “Let’s stay as a group, ok? I don’t know what to believe...” Yeah… me too buddy. Everyone was in the same place. Everyone was there, no one could have done something more. I made sure of it as I moved. Tracking 11 people around a house isn’t an easy job… not at all. But… that begs the question… Why didn’t I hear anything? Again, the issue with the sound… Why can’t I hear them do anything? I was so close to the other room, I should have been able to hear everything… but… How could someone get inside a closed room? How can they enter it? So, the two new victims. The first one was in a closed room. She went there around 9 PM to get some rest and asked Rachel to check on her. She never came back, even though she tried several times to knock on the door. That I heard myself. The other crime was done outside, the victim being Michael, an older man. He went there alone and the result was this. Apparently there was a window open when he did. He went there at around 10 PM from what I heard from the others. How can these crimes be committed without anyone being there? Is there another person here? Other than me? People remaining: 10/16 Part 3 “Hahaha… ahahahahaha!” even as she had been thrown to the ground, Rachel kept laughing, not even trying to get back up. “You can’t do anything to me now. Go ahead! Try!” She smiled at the man that hit her, a smile unlike anything a normal girl’s. One filled with malice and if anything, bloodlust. “Peter! What in God’s name are you doing?!” A woman from the corner of the room noticed the commotion and placed herself in between the two. “You’re just a servant! How dare you do something like this?” She wasn’t speaking of the moral actions of an adult doing something like this to a child, but that of a servant laying their hands on a Hunberct. In this woman’s head, the latter was of greater importance. “S-Sorry mam… but she… ” “I won’t hear any of this!” As she raised her voice she pointed the carbine strapped over her shoulder at the man. “I don’t know what sort of relationship was between Amelia and you, but it’s gone now. I won’t stand by as something like this goes on. All of you servants are suspicious. It was a great idea to take the keys from the main desk and the master key after that… incident.” She was of course talking about the sudden disappearances of the bodies. As a result of this, all the remaining crime scenes were closely guarded. “M-mam… please… ” “If you are so quick to beg, then go with Arthur to change the shift outside. Old Charles and Helen must have-” Yet, her thought was interrupted by what appeared to be… gunshots. Not from outside, but from the inside. Even though I listened to the conversation while hiding behind a large couch in the corner of the room, next to the hallway, I could swear the sound reverberated so that it was near impossible to tell from where the shooting began. The couch in question I smeared with my own blood. It’s a wonder what a few cuts on your hand can do. In a way, I added a bit more intrigue to the killing, but I did so only to have a reliable place to hide near the hallway. Everybody rushed out of the room, leaving only Rachel there, laying down on the floor. She slowly got up and followed behind them while muttering something. This was my chance. With the place cleared, I could exit through one of the windows here. Since I have a rough idea where the other bodies are I can safely get away. I mean, I would love to catch the killer, but at this rate everyone will die. I want no part in this. As soon as I opened the window the heavy rain enveloped the room itself. It would be impossible not to notice that it was opened once I stepped outside and if I couldn’t find shelter outside… then I would surely die. But it’s better there than here. Pocket knife in hand, I ran into the woods and circled around the house so that I could see the main entrance, yet as I did so I noticed something… weird. I tried picturing the house itself, how the floors were set up and where were the random rooms where the people disappeared from. “Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.” The realization hit me. The rooms were chosen. They weren’t random. They were the only ones that were above rooms without a window. All of them on the first floor. Then… I just stood there for what appeared to be an eternity before making up my mind. Instead of going towards the pier, I went deeper into the forest. Somewhere around here. Somewhere around here. Shallow ground. I need to find it. There is no other place to hide them. Everything is connected to the mansion. There would be no way to hide a body there. Then, here, it would be the perfect solution. Still, I nee- “Found it.” I wasn’t running aimlessly. While I didn’t know the mansion very well, I got to know the woods around these parts on my first day here. There are very few places where tree roots are few enough to dig a hole big enough to hide a body. In one such place out of the three that I remembered, one of them was easier to dig into. This place was dug up. There is nothing paranormal here. Nothing. Whoever it is… is it trying to make people cower in fear? I can’t figure out their motives, but… “I might be able to save them.” The rest of the people there. If I am fast enough, I might be able to do something before it’s too late. I started digging with my bare hands. I don’t know why I am doing this. These people mean nothing to me. Did it take something like this to grow a conscience? Is this Stockholm Syndrome? I’ll be damned if I knew, but… “I knew it.” Wrapped in cloth, I could count 4 dismembered bodies. I didn’t have the mental strength to unveil the horrors within, but all of them seemed to be here. “Then, the killer is one of the remaining people.” I couldn’t bring any solid evidence as to why and how they did this, but at least I know that the bodies didn’t just disappear over night. There is a person that is pulling all the strings. There isn’t anyone from the exterior. Someone that knew this island well could be able to do something like this. The island and the mansion. “Now, let’s get back.” I ran as fast as I could back to the mansion. I don’t know who you are, but I am going to find you with this. I am sure you got everything planned out. But there is one thing you haven’t counted on being here. Me. From how things progressed so far, you have no clue I am here as well. I bet you didn’t expect the blood on the couch, huh? That’s why you got scared and started outright shooting people? Then, how about a move like this! I threw a rock at one of the windows, shattering it. Then at another. And another. I’ll make it true. This criminal that you invented. I will make it the 16th person on this island. One that not even you had planned for. Mysteries? Locked rooms? I’ll open them all for you! I’ll make it so they realize! That the things happening here are still solvable! Part 4 There are many things people aren’t prepared for. For example their deaths. They would lie and deceive others to the bitter end if it would bring their salvation, yet trusting your life to a murderer in the first place, in these kinds of conditions would be nothing more than suicide. Hearing the words of the servant that witnessed the shooting, I thought of this. She was hysterical to the point where it didn’t even matter if her words were addressed to someone she never even met before. The thought didn’t even register that I was someone else. Someone that shouldn’t be here. Yet she pled and told me that it was Krauss that killed them. Krauss the vampire. They shot him, but nothing happened, they shot until no bullets were left, but he only smiled as he killed them with the bullets they’d shot at him. Disregarding the rope marks on her hands, disregarding the fact that her nails were ripped and her fingers were bleeding as she grabbed onto my shirt, she pleaded with me that this was all real. I told her that I believe her and told her to run to the pier, where I would bring the others. Of course, I wouldn’t do anything like this. Not when I was so close to the final act. There should be another 6 people in the mansion. 3 of them were killed in the shooting. 1 person escaped. Yet, the person that escaped didn’t meet up with anyone else but me. Now she will be either a suspect or deemed disappeared. I shouldn’t care much about her, but the people remaining. The doctor died along with a female servant and old Teresa. Even though the two should have been outside, guarding the place of the murder, they weren’t there when they were killed, but rather in the boiler room with the others. There are still a few things that I can think of, but I will need to think carefully about them. Mostly, about who to trust. The remaining people in the mansion are Rachel, Oscar, Arthur, Helen, and Peter. One of them is the killer. Think. Think. Who was where when the killings happened. These impossible killings all have to have a normal explanation. What am I missing? A motive? Why is this “Krauss” trying to be Krauss? What does he or she have to gain from this? Terror? Do they plan on killing everyone? Or is the intent something material? Did I miss something? Like an inheritance that should have played out but didn’t? Did someone get cheated out of their money? No, really? What is the reason behind a murder? This was thoroughly planned, so I doubt it’s something as simple as these motives anyone can come up with. At what good are complicated murders if not to dazzle and hide? To not be found. Perhaps this time the intent wasn’t necessarily not to be found, but rather, to gain enough time to kill everyone. 14 people are a lot. Even from something like hiding a bomb, some of them could have escaped… but they could just kill the stranders afterward… No, they wanted to make them doubt one another. They wanted them to suspect and perhaps even try and kill one another. So a vendetta, then? They just wanted to kill everyone, then? As cruelly and interesting as possible, as if for an audience…. To think that the only audience here is a thief. Even though these crimes might be for the police or investigators, or perhaps the world at large, I am the first one to see them. I am honored. I smiled a daring smile as I ran around the building. Even though it was dangerous to go around the house since I might get shot by “Krauss” if I’m not careful, it was suicide to go inside. I ran alongside the hallways, making my way towards the boiler room. Even as there was a door on the outside, it might be guarded, but I needed to make sure of it. Of the weapon used. There are plenty of expensive weapons here, but one, in particular, I heard about, mostly because of my profession. Here, in this mansion, there might be a lot of them, actually, if I think about it. The people here often use carbines from what I see, so that one should be… “De Lisle.” I couldn’t help but mouth over as I noticed through a window the gun that Helen had on her as she barely held onto the door frame of the boiler room, fighting to stay awake. I didn’t pay much attention before, but it was what I was looking for. I finally had the final piece of the puzzle. Now, all that remained was to make my move. Or so I thought. I don’t know if the shot was meant for me, or for Helen, but it hit her in the throat, through the window. Without a sound, without anything, as if a pebble went through. Even the window didn’t shatter but rather the shot went through with only a crack. That was the only sound that I managed to hear through the pouring rain. Looking behind me, I managed to see it. “Krauss”, the murderer standing behind me on top of a hill facing down the mansion. “I didn’t expect someone else to ruin my plans, but I guess, it’s for the better. I was always more of the ‘hunter’ type.” “I don’t doubt it.” I said as I walked into the woods as if led by “Krauss”. “Mind if I ask you a question?” “Ask away.” “The typhoon isn’t as bad as it was forecasted. It’s just a bit more rainy than usual. Is that why you guys went with the boat thing to discourage the rest?” “That’s right.” “But didn’t the doctor help you?” “Oh, please, that old man? Even though he went with the lie Arthur told him, saying that no one can leave the island, that wasn’t enough to save him. He had it a long way coming.” “I see...” “But you… you saw through everything, didn’t you? In the end, you already knew who I was, right?” “Yeah. I had a hunch, but I only needed to confirm a few details.” “Then, tell me. Call me by name. Who am I?” As the words escaped my lips, I could feel the world growing distant, the echo of my voice enveloping the island, never to be heard by those that needed it the most. ----------——----__-----___--——---------__—-—---------- That’s all. I gave all the clues that were possible. This was indeed a bit rushed, and perhaps it would have beneficiated a lot from more development, but I just wanted to draft everything to see how it worked. It seems like an idea worthy of a book, really. Perhaps I will adapt it eventually. I will await your answers for who you think is the killer, as well as how the people were killed. Hope you liked it. The story of a thief that wanted to be a hero ended up not being able to save anyone.",
788,"Been smoking for 1 year, and feel like I need to stop but it’s been the only thing that has helped with suicidal thoughtsI turned 18 not too long ago. Since childhood I’ve been extremely anxious/depressed and just racked with mental pain in general. I’ve never been happy in life, and the few times something has made me happy it’s been snatched away from me. I tried weed over a year ago. Ever since trying it, I’ve seen it as another world where I can go to try to avoid my pain. I have a very active brain and almost every second of the day I’m overthinking something. I have had been obsessed with death ever since a child. I’ve been using weed with irresponsible intentions. I’ve never admitted this, but I started using weed to either A) escape my pain, or B) make my brain dumb enough to not be able to feel or process the pain. I purposefully wanted the weed to hurt my mental processes so it’d slow me down. I figured if I smoked, I’d become more dumb and not be able to process the idea of death and pain as well as I had been. So it would be an escape when I was high, and it would also make me dumber when I wasn’t high. “If I fall, if I die, know I lived it to the fullest. If I fall, if I die, know I lived and missed some bullets” was basically how I felt about weed. (Shoutout Kid Cudi for letting me know I wasn’t alone) It has been working. For 2 or 3 hours every night, I’ve been happier and the rest of the time my brain fog keeps my mind calmer and doesn’t let it start to think. There was a period of about 2 or 3 months where I wasn’t consistently having suicidal thoughts, which had never happened in my life before. So it did help me, and I’m honestly not sure I would still be here without it. I don’t think I’ve done irreversible damage in any way. I mostly only smoke at night. But it’s been a straight year of being high every night. I’m an engineering college student. It’s super rigorous, and I feel like I can’t compromise my intelligence anymore. I have so much brain fog and my tolerance is through roof. 1/4 of a joint was enough to get me plenty high. Now I will have 2 or 3 and feel like I need more. I was just wondering if there is anyone else out there who feels like me. I just needed a place to vent and hopefully some of you can give me some advice. Thank you",
789,"18m my story of the past three years So it all really started when I was around, idk actually. My parents explained my recurring night terrors but I never had quit to continually recount how they had been with me seemingly all my life. It would be hell before I went to bed, that I would remember as I would put up a fuss knowing that some horror scenario was going to occur in my sleep until I would be awoken with fright only to be put back to sleep and awake over and over again. This continued with bed wettings until I was 12 when I prayed to God and my grandma gave me a dream catcher so I could finally enjoy peaceful dreams again. Now this next part is inappropriate in its own manner because it draws out I began to relate all of my issues to my genitals being mutilated. Being potty trained and peeing over the plastic toilet or folding back the remains of my severed prepuce felt like the only odd thing nature had truly messed up to me as a young child, other than that I felt very pure and perfect in everyway. Fast forward to the age of 15 and I came across a post by a woman who I had great respect for protesting against circumcision. I knew not much more than the bible and my dad explaining it to me at one point when I was 8: saying they sliced just the tip incase I married a Jewish woman with great pride, so during that time, I had assumed it was only my glans or for reference the male clitoris. If it was only just a little nick which I did notice a weird discoloration at the tip like some amount had been sliced, then what was the damage done I had said to myself. Well being 15 I went to look on google and came across the usual excuses and ideas such as a photo comparing a circed and an uncirced and to me this struck me as a little odd as I now have a deeper understanding that they cut off quite a large length. I wasn't too hurt though as I quested through an article making it sound like the foreskin would never retract. So I felt fine and assumed then and there that my parents would never hurt me and they had in fact given me more sexual pleasure. Well that would have been the case had not my psoriasis developed onto my tip and now things are going to get a little more graphic. I must advise any children reading this to look this stuff at their own risk with regards to their mental health and to save their sexual wholeness at all costs as I am not ashamed to admit that porn and masturbation and a desire to fornicate played a great role in my later dysfunction too. Dear children, there is nothing more pleasing or better then to spend your eyes and sex with an actual human being and if you are ever to go look this stuff up out of curiosity I highly advice you to not even though I feel this is hard with our society 1. telling girls to dress promiscuously 2. comparing our sexual instinct to animals and not to a higher divine class of beauty and civility 3. again, censoring ""hate and abuse"" but not the very thing that makes our genetics immortal in a higher tongue of speech. So psoriasis, a skin disease caused by an overabundance of heavy metals from the sky and water on my genitals. A sensitive exposed part now itched and was right next to the open remains of my foreskin constantly exposed, persuading me to porn. And then it hit. I wondered why my glans looked terrible compared to a lot of pornstars and others did not where they were smooth like that of the mouth. I would later learn it is because the glans are an eternal organ lacking the barrier of the epidermis that makes skin greyish, and that due to exposure, it had developed a callous like of the same material of nails or hair. In reality the only pleasure for most men was on the cornara, the area under the glans technically the foreskin, usually not stimulated directly. This direct stimulation causes a dysfunctional sensation that men will burst for a short period of time after much senseless rubbing causing an issue that is abrasive ro female genitale, something we know as PE. And in more traumatic cases, some develop a case where they cant cum because all of the foreskin is taken. Luckily for me and probably not known to my father's experience (he was the kind of man who took family baths and showers when we were little so I saw his botched tiny dick) my doctor was nice enough to leave me with a frenulum amd enough foreskin to make it longer. It was by far the mostagically sensitive and pleasing part of what was left of my foreskin. I could hump my bed to orgams and I would fly through space on rare occasions (that is what I suspect intact men feel all the time) all because of this compacted skin underneath my penis. So for circumcised men, if you feel any sexual pleasure it is because of the foreskin and alot of us had most of it taken away. This realization gave me a resurgence of desire to look further and soon I feel into an obsession. I eventually confronted my dumbfounded parents. First it was family therapy, then personal therapy and soon my hobby and enjoyment of red pilling became a serious stressful matter as it is still is today that all the chemiclas dumped on us and brainwashing was apart of this bigger scheme to hurt us all and that because of this my parents were stupid enough to make a choice like this. I looked to religion desperately wondering if god could save me from my new misery of this genitle cutting culture. No one was sympathetic because to them I was attacking them whenever I cried out in pain from misery. Who could make such a sacrifice to think I was right, it would mean that they were not safe and those such as their doctors, our parents may have not had their best interests, or worse, not known what was best for them. I packed a bible one night and some cans of food to walk forty miles and sleep in the field only to frightened that to escape this new hell I would now have to eat racoons most likely. It couldn't and so forty miles back I found the police at my house who took me to get screened against my will remind me of the lack of freedom and consent this society will have in store for me. Land of the free was a lie too. And my patriotic father, circumcised by his intact immigrant father could never think that this world was not for his best interest. That WWII was the war to end all evil and how there was just a few more battles to fight in conservatism. He had even thought til so long ago that his father was circumcised. A case of cognitive dissonance, on both sides if you consider it. Later I would walk another twenty miles that summer barefoot thinking I could live away on the nearby island only to be frightened again and walk home to my parents again. It really started to plague my life, the perfect American life as I do not think for the past three years I have gone a day without having to pee in the toilet wherever I go and see it. Or walk and feel it. And I think that was what had gotten to me the most when I had tried to run away, knowing that no matter how far I go, whether it be the edge of the universe, I would be reminded that my PRIVATE PARTS were not mine to even nurture like the rest of my body. And I am an intelligent kid, cooking since my mom showed me how to, building my own 20 square foot garden in a dense weed patch all by myself and growing every year, and maintaining my own saltwater aquarium since I had been 12 with coral. I really wanted it to leavey head and end and no therapist telling me I was wrong and I had obsessive COMPULSIVE disorder or throwing meds at me for being down about not having hope helped. So I poured bleach on my skin to make the constant rubbing go away and over time forget about it. I lost my frenulums feeling and since then masturbation has never been the same. I then tried to pull over the skim that was left over my glans and at times I was able to keep it on for three days holding in my pee and the feeling was majestic as the old callous skin regained its sensitivity. But after a case of mt skin tearing near the bottom I stopped. I ordered aesthetic foreskins that my mom threw at me in hope I would stop my bitching. It only reminded me of what I was missing. Eventually school became impossible and Junior year, 7 months since discovery I was admitted to the hospital for the first time after an overdose on aspirin when my stressed parents scolded me and walked when I was in need. They love me but I have noticed that they try to stay as far away from me as possible whenever I explain my feelings about this often telling me I guilting them. And it is hard because before all this my parents were my best friends amd things are getting better now, I try not to bring it up regardless of my daily suicidal thoughts because in order to maintain the romantic life they plead for must hide my pain from everyone (except you guys:-)) My suicidal thoughts appeared for any of you parents dealing with kids like this or anyone else going through this when they thought medicine would cure my ""OCD."" It doesnt, it does not, I am telling you this stuff keeps you where yoh are at, regardless of what they say, stop taking pills, they are bad for you, they cause suicide and much of it is being recycled into our water! We are in an epidemic. But back to the hospital, I noticed the keen difference between the gentleness between the nurses for the physically sick and the mentally sick. In the actual hospital, it was like heaven and I had a lot of good thoughts and I was feeling better. In the mental hospital it was like a prison and they made all coping impossible. No it was smaller than a prison, it was hell. I lost part of my should there and the doctors kept me there as long as they could because I refused to accept that I should be circumcised. I wanted understanding, but in reality I had gotten a relash as the hospital supported the idea that I was mentally deranged for having an opinion and a conflict of interest that was personal and great to me where nothing could be done due to the indifference towards an issue that they were taught to support and accept. Come winter of that same year and this time I was kept from Christmas and the rest of the holidays after I had gone mad in the men's bathroom. I held the rage as best I could think about how could women be so indifferent towards the treatment of men. They went to the bathroom where no one would ever experience any sort of discriminatiom on their genitals, the peace of mind. When I got home I couldn't restrain from speaking in front of my grandma, this tradition of abuse must not go unheard of for anyone when to the best of my ability and full understanding of my loss and the hardship of not being able to escape such wounds. Of course I rather talked of my want to just cut myself infront of my dad, which earned me a trip to the hospital that night never having gotten to my disscuss with the mutilation. I never told her until this past year actually, amd this event took place a little over two years ago. Anyhow, I went back to the hospital where again I tried talking to the people I was supposed to trust the most, the ones who were being paid to show me a purpose to life as I will remind you I admitted myself in that night. Instead they treated again like a deluded prisoner as one of the staff members told me with pride how he watched his son get circumcised. Totally insensitive to my feelings I held my trigger in and every once in awhile I would bash the concrete walls with my fist before a fat guard came in with a needle to pinch me with his useless tranquilizer. After two weeks and a larfer will to kill myself more then before I did all they said, lied to with a mask and escaped hell once more. I will remind you they are all the same too as this one was Centerprism and not anything else. The outpatient program was light in all of this misery. I had not yet shared among my peer friends my feelings but the leader or coordinator, an older man had been the most sensitive and understanding of all of them. Even though he couldn't quite grasp mt feelings, he never took me for a rivalry but saw me as the broken kid I was encouraging me to share with the rest of the group. I drew a lot of pictures and everyone appreciated me. But it was hard to share my ""obsessive feelings"" as I would say to the group and I would then share my hurtness best I could. Over time the bonds and new group, a whole broken us made a great social group that I will never forget. Many times throughout such history of these patient programs had I met the nicest most inclusive people ever always getting the best compliments ever. Maybe they should have made some daycare for us out casts as it was in a way because we could all see past our hardships and bond together, something many of us were simply missing out on. Fuckedicene, all it had ever gotten me was more abuse from truly sick people because I had suffered some.side effects these institutions never stopped to ignore. Well time passed, one day after spring break I couldn't get out of bed to finish my midterms at my private school amd so I transferred to my local.public school. People were cool there too, more so then they are at college these days. And then I fell into a depression again this time as my parents wanted it for me to get better once amd for all by following the dogmatic principles of the medicine institution that had been bothering me in the first place. They sent me to a home with five other teenagers where I was completely devoid of contact. It was interesting, there were two who had a love affair and this caused a lot of group punishment. Everything was super strict and at times I felt pretty okay growing an attachment to the tv as I watched impractical jokers amd formed a sort of sibling relationship with one of the members who was surprised to see herself stay the longest, darling redhead she was. And I went home and it felt amazing similar to the feeling of getting out of a prison again as they continually punished me for being deranged over my civilly mauled genitals. I then had a happy summer, I think I had smoked weed for the first time the summer before and had gotten addicted to nicotine after winter. Hey, I am sure these all of a part to play in the grander scheme of things of my mental health. But there is no doubt in my memory which my m can tell you is pristine since I was two as I remember not wanting to turn three or five as I guided my mom to the car in the vast parking lot. I can tell you it was my discovery of thr truth of my genitle mutilation that pushed me over the line. Amd all of you temperance activists agsinst drugs or sex will have different opinions, but keep in mind too, for all these things, I have felt some control for and over. Not my missing body part. Part two was when I had a big disagreement again and I drove two whole stares through the midwest before getting my car stuck in a ditch. I walked around for awhile in a minnesota until I came to a very nice farmer. ""How you doing he cheered"" ""You interested in what I am making!?"" he yaltered as his machine screeched against wood. "" No,"" I said "" Um actually I had gotten my car stuck in a ditch. I was truly in the middle of nowhere and before altering to this man I had wandered for at least two hours coming to many houses were all there was was a landline and no understanding of my need. This man smiled, he was clearly of sweedish descent as all Minnasotians are. Guess I'll have to get Kenny then"" he exclaimed sight fully. He drove me i'm one of his many trucks to my car and up met the next old man with more energy than any man I have seen today. With a few exchanges of cuss words and some failures, we got the car out. I was out of money and the car was near empty, I had to go through half of Minnasoata, Iowa and then half of Missouri, all in one trip. The man had been making a wedding alter for his daugher and he made me understand just how big the world truly is. The trip back was exhausting, I slept during certain part of the road only to be awakened by my driving need to survive and get home again. I won't forget the fresh air or the weird urban cities I had to go through or how when I stopped at some places to try and call my parentd the land lines wouldn't reach which I was discouraged in disbelief. Only the road and fumes would get me home. I stopped at almost every ramp to beg for fas money and people were resilient to even give up five. It made me understand the importance of charity. and finally after a few recognizable streets and bridges and me hallucinating from sleep deprivation at the end. I came home, many times it crossed my mind that I would stop at the road with no way to contact since I had left my phone in order not to be tracked. Soundly I slept that night only to quickly wake up just in time for school the next morning, one day late. I went to Mercy again this time at the same time as last fall. There I saw a lot of hot girls, and I couldn't help thinking to myself that maybe my issue with all of this circumcison was not ever having sex yet. That I was just an incel and I should lose my virginity to someone special. So I refrained and I waited and I spotted my favorite. Then community formed among us children and I got her number near the end of our two week stay. We ended up leaving at the same time too and against the policy of the hospital, she gave me a hug before leaving. She had tried to kill herself after getting threats from her ex who had found out she had issues and was a cutter. I did not mind because I felt she just needed love. At my stah I had also successfully confessed of my issue and feeling with my peers toward circumcision and felt me to be a brave man. However, contrary to the nurses promise of not being judged for my feelings, they kicked everyone out as I got loud and passionate. It was hard not too as a monstrous wave of emotion overwhelmed me, I had been through so much. After leaving unfortunately for this girl of my same and similar age when I had gotten out to ask her to see a scary movie during halloween she was gone, gone for a while. And then after one concert for my public school orchestra, I got really drunk with my cousin (and now as I type this serionin is seeping in not because of this but because of the after.) I had spoken of my nihilism towards my neighbors and their lack of kindness compared to the others I met on my many journeys that this mutilations revelation has condemned me to. Unfortunately, as I was crazy drunk somehow it had gotten translated that when I said ""I am going to kill you all"" that, as a rumor, I had brought a gun to school, when in fact I was just solemnly bought and taken back home to be announced that due to fears of me that I was to be ostracized for a thing I had no intention of doing. I watched three movies in a row that day last being into the spider verse as everywhere I spent, developed relationships, even at my old school was torn from me as by three schools it had been assumed that I was planning on shooting up. All my teachers, disappointed and every former acquaintance now saw treachery. To my misery when I emailed my current teachers they confirmed to my concerns that they were happy that the rumors were not true, so petty yet expected of them. I think the true crime is these city dwellers not knowing they should feel guilty for not possessing a free mind. No one thought on their own because I all learned that day is how fake everyone was andaube message drunkenized had some meaning I now meant even though I had not meant it all before. I called my mom from a hotel that night wondering if I could die just like my boy scout friend had earlier that year just simply and pain free with some opioid. I wanted a prostitute but felt indifferent to it without my foreskin. Then came exactly last of my current time of January 2020. That spring was so delightful as I sincerely hope it will be this year. I finally had gotten in touch with the girl and we instantly felt a deep connection. There was just one problem, she lived in New Haven and I live in St. Louis, forty miles away. So we befam by meeting in the middle. I guess during that time as beautiful as she was no one wanted her since she was seen as a self harmer. I could see past that. I showed her how to build a fire. We explored the city in the middle of Washington, Missouri, a historic town. And not soon after in one of my most significant parts of my life I explored her as she did for me. She was a little crazy from the start but I digged it. After having looked into her youthful face and fucking twice in my car behinde one of theant rural strip malls of Washington, I couldnt help but feel at peace for once in my life. I felt a deep loving connection in my dreams as my mind craved her pussy in a beautiful amd not even lustful way. She had no fear as she took birth control. But then things got bad. It wasn't even after two weeks of our honey moon phase and kids if tou have come this far please know that this is why sex should never be played arojnd with. Not to soon my parents caught on to my secret love affair as one night I didn't come home as J choose to stay the night at her Grandmas house. 40 miles there and back my parents drove in the morning to wait outside her Grandmas house knowing my location somehow. Feeling aneixity I couldnt help but release my pronlems onto her for example jow I couldnt insert my penis im as well due to a lack of the softness and mucosa the penis must have and how I came to quick amd thereafter in hoping of making her cum I would fuck her after the climax painfully and flaccid it would get. I was not in tune and my dick felt very little, but there was somehow love, just without the erotica I felt terrible. Our problems from there on manifested as now my parents continued to grip a control on my sexual nature,, I was 17 with another 17 year keep in mind. They wouldn't let me have the car and it was hard to visit her. I soon discovered her mom got pregnant in college and her true father was in New York. She had an abusive step father with his three sons and daughter. For the newborn son, he had a botched circumcision which triggered me and I had gotten angry with my new girlfriend (not abusive, just riled at the world stupidity) and she said she was sorry and didn't know better. She told me how at one point they had kept her locked in her room with just bread and she couldn't even get out to pee. No wonder she was self-harming. Eventually due to a lack of getting the car I was forced to pay for uber and then by train.T he days continued and at one point I ran away again leaving myself with amtrak train to get to her house for a week. I was finishing up online school too, but like I said my parents past could not leave me as I would make love to my girlfriend. I felt it and was reminded and saw how thier prescence made me fail to perform sex right. It was like they had carved their names into me so no matter what I could not stop loving them and I would have to pretend like they made a good choice, even in the fact of.violating me. Because who is going to stop the business between a child and his parent? Who will stop a predator from procreating for the sole purpose of molesting their kids? Can a parent consent for thier kid if they are to have sex because according to the law I am not seen as important enough to be saved from any harm since I must carry the genes of my parents filthy habits? So many more questions passed through my head and so much control and manipulation from both mt parents and girlfriend drained me of my spirit. I eventually made it home only to discover she had become pregnant but then had od to abort the child. Painful. Over the summer we continued to work on ourselves but never did my parents fail it stress me and at times it was difficult to go back home as my girlfriend begged me to stay. Finally at the end of the summer we broke up after being two weeks in college. And then there is rested the same case of misery as I was left alone to my foreskinless penis. We broke it off too being thag I realized sex of all things was so lame. My circumcison had weakend my sensation to understand how to fuck her and in a way I was blind to the vagina. Bacteria is good and plays a role in sex. Without the foreskin I couldn't interact with my girls vagina/g spot where the frenulum lays in doggy style. My veins many of so were popped and I noticed a development of ED as my penis has grown whiter over this pas year. It hurts me that no matter what I was wrong and deep down actually right. And the more I looked online, the more I studied the faditutes of circumcison I becaem depressedm Near the end I will admit my girlfriend wanted to hace more sex then I did and my parnets continued to make me feel guilty about it. After all child development is designed to be expensive so more people in their self interest to kill their children, and I wouldn't want to bring that in. She went throuh three more boyfriends that semester before getting bsck with her fucking ex who would tell her to kill herself and now she is pregnant with them and all I can say is I hope she wont get him circumcised and they have a happy marrige as it is now. But something tells me this curse will continue as does any thing with the sexual exploitation of children so I guess I hope its a girl. Anyways, doctors continue to post live circumcisions on youtube because they can and everyone is silent on it. I spend half my day hopeful and the other half depressed and suicidal. I discovered the foreskin is a sphincter (look it up in the dictionary) with in reality a five fold skin structure. I also realized that every excuse to do so can be found to be a lie lost easily at CIRP.org for the harvesting of neonatal fibroblast for both cosmetics and scientific research. They lied to my parents for a clear economic motivation and there certainly was no bear interest in mind if you have listened to a segment of my story. It does piss me off that we are in fact losing and many intactivist find themselves trapped in some sort of identification they didn't ask for when they are speaking in accordance with the opinion of more than 70% of the world which is intact. I really hope girls espically and boys absolutley would bring attention to this against thier superiors. They claim that we do not complain, but if a man has never seen sight, how could he complain. To find plenty of complaints head here r/circumcisiongrief Otherwise your condolences would be appreciated as I am still struggling. Thank you.",
790,"I actually like Kylo RenDespite most of the hate Kylo has gotten, (although this has diminished since TLJ) I’ve liked Kylo since his intro. I don’t think he’s the perfect character, nor do I perceive him as a groundbreaking one, but he genuinely interests me. Reason #1 is easily his Aesthetic. His Revan/Vader reminiscent inspired outfit looks fantastic. [Badass](https://imgur.com/a/q7HLM4R) and almost feral seeming much like his lightsaber. His lightsaber untamed and rigid much like his personality and soul, showing instability and imbalance. His voice modification sounds wonderful, and he’s easily one of my favorite villains to play as in BF2. Reason #2 would be his powers. Kylo has some incredible force powers and raw talent, though the movies don’t showcase this as well as other forms of media. Obviously his force stasis ability, mind interrogation (beautifully illustrated in BF2), etc. But what we don’t see is just how talented and sharpened his abilities TRULY are. For example, in the novelization of The Force Awakens, he’s disarmed in his duel with Rey. So he deflects a handful of her lightsaber swings with his hands using Tutamenis. The sheer amount of concentration and training, as well as power required to do this is something we only see from characters like Yoda or Satele Shan, etc. Add onto the fact he took a bowcaster to the gut, a shoulder injury, not trying to kill Rey, and was imbalanced from recently killing his father. In the comics he created a force repulse that completely obliterated the dark side cave on dagobah. Despite the movies lacking in showing his true potential, other media beautifully highlights just how dangerous and sharpened he actually is as a force user. He isn’t the only one, as this is the case with Phasma, as well as most Star Wars characters. (Episode III doesn’t hold a candle to its novelization or TCW series). Reason #3 is his arc. Though we’re only recently getting more backstory to Kylo, he easily has the most interesting character arc out of all the new trilogy characters. He starts off as a neglected child due to Han running around the galaxy and Leia governing, with his head filled with the idealistic evil of Snoke. His master and uncle who he thought he could trust tries to murder him, in his eyes. He’s an emotionally tormented young man much like Anakin, and seeks power to achieve happiness and a future he wants. He sees no problem in what he’s doing, and thinks he’s justified in his acts. Part of it is because of being influenced by a young age into following the teachings of the dark side, having his reality twisted into one of false order. These voices (Snoke and Vader, Whomst may be Palpatine manipulating him as per most recent RoS trailer) convincing him this is the only right path to take. Yet we still see conflict in him and moments of weakness, regret, glimpses of light. He’s routinely tried not to kill Rey because he wants her to join him and help create a world he sees as right, one without the Jedi or sith, a new world where things make sense for him. Killing his father devastated him and split his soul to the bone, filled with regret. When faced with killing his mother he was incapable of the act. When in the dark side cave he couldn’t kill the visions of his parents. While he isn’t quite worthy of redemption, and is still very much evil, he’s human. He’s being manipulated much like Anakin was, I’d say closer to how Sidious manipulated Maul if anything. When he was most vulnerable his entire outlook was twisted and his brain reprogrammed by those who took advantage of him and acted as caring “teachers”. From what I’ve gathered, it seems like he’s starting to finally wake up and make his own path. Though he’s still misguided in what the right pathway is. He’s an incomplete character, and isn’t the BEST in Star Wars, but he intrigues me. I’m genuinely interested to see how much they build on him and his full arc because he’s one of the best new gen characters we have. Reason #4 he doesn’t have to be THAT villain. Darth Vader is a very terrifying and godly seeming villain, well composed, seemingly heartless, faceless, imposing. Maul is a viscous and rage-filled monster. Dooku is a highly intelligent and graceful villain with wisdom and wit. These are all different villains. Kylo is a villain as well, but one made for us to pity more than fear. He’s a victim of manipulation and circumstance, and emotionally unstable. I’d liken him to Zannah in her early years training under Darth Bane. Unsure of himself, vulnerable, not fully given to the darkside. He isn’t supposed to be a very intimidating and godly villain, or an elegant one. He’s a very human villain we are supposed to feel for and follow his story, what makes him this way, what he can become. Kylo is a villain that isn’t fully submerged into evil intent, and doesn’t see his own actions as inherently evil. He’s doing what he thinks he should do, but we do see moments of doubt in himself and if he’s truly right in what he’s doing. And- I like it. I think it’s a good change, it would be boring if he were just another Vader, or just another (insert main villain). He’s also an incomplete character that’s still growing, he hasn’t yet become the full villain he (might) be one day. It takes time for one to develop into that. You could argue based on the movies he’s too whiny and bratty, but I could say that about Anakin or Luke just as easily. Most movies don’t do the characters as much justice as their novels or extended lore. The movies wouldn’t tell you Phasma used to be the leader of an elite warrior race, or that she manipulated the army of an entire planet into a suicide mission just so she could eliminate the officer who witnessed her lower the starkiller base shields. It’s great to see other fans that love him, because we get wonderful creations such as [this.](https://youtu.be/owrmLeX20CY) Of course, this is all opinion based and you’re welcome to disagree with me. Just do so respectfully. As this is a friendly discussion, not a debate.",
791,"Popular Youtuber Advocates Aborting Autistic/Mentally Handicapped People in the Womb: An Open Letter from An Autistic Person to Unnatural VeganHello everyone, Faye Fahrenheit here. I made an hour an 17 minute long response video to Unnatural Vegan, because she advocated aborting mentally handicapped and autistic people in the womb. # You can watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpOYDxJAV6I), but I had a few important things to add: I am autistic, and when I was 16 my mother abandoned me and my older brother who was both mentally handicapped and terminally ill. I cared for him while going to high school, and got him into a living facility for people with his needs, and made him comfortable while died. He died when I was 19. I say this because I have been a caregiver. My brother couldn't use the bathroom without help and wore diapers until his dying day. My brother was afraid of the shower because he fell in it once and so I had to help him bathe. He needed a lot of help, and I loved him much. RIP Jeremy 2010. As for me, I have struggled with autistic self injury, ripping my own hair out, plucking my eyelashes out, and picking huge crators in my skin. In her video she claims neurodiversity advocates are the people who never suffered because of their disabilities and I'm here to say that's 100% untrue. Both myself and my mentally handicapped brother were supporters of the Neurodiversity Movement. She also seems to think caregivers aren't part of the movement, and I'm here to say I was a caregiver. I have also worked professionally with people who have Down's, nonspeaking autistics, on dementia wards, and on hospice as a personal care provider. Now, onto my major criticisms of her video: # Unnatural Vegan's Video and why its (unintentionally???) ableist: She made a video about a raw food vegan feeding her kid a raw vegan diet to ""cure"" the autism. I like the idea of the video, and I appreciate that she's coming out against anti vaxxers however, but unfortunately half way through her video, she began to start promoting misinformation, myths, and outright lies about the [Neurodiversity Movement](https://autisticadvocacy.org/2017/02/autism-and-the-disability-community-the-politics-of-neurodiversity-causation-and-cure/), which is a civil rights movement. She states in the video that she knows you can't make an autistic brain not autistic-it's how we developed in the womb, some areas of the brain are overdeveloped, others are underdeveloped. For example I was reading at a college level before kindergarten, but as an adult I've yet to master driving a car. Autistic people are difficult to categorize, and the terms ""high functioning"" and low functioning"" have fallen out of favor, with the current DSM referring to autistic people via support levels(the kind of help you need) instead. **In her video she either lies about or clearly doesn't understand the neurodiversity movement. Here is a list of her claims I take issue with:** &#x200B; * She states this she states that she is in favor of a prenatal test to abort autistic people in the womb. She uses the fact that some autistic people can't live on their own, and are mentally handicapped to support her belief that this is a good thing. * She states that \*ALL\* neurodiversity or autism rights advocates ""have mild aspergers"" which is ""a big problem with the neurodiversity movement"". This is categorically and completely untrue, and in my video I feature countless nonspeaking and severely autistic advocates and activists. Nonspeakers were the some of the founders and forerunners of our movement. Five minutes of googling would have shown her countless severely autistic advocates. * It's also really not cool to call someone ""mildly autistic"" because it's kinda like saying they have ""a little bit of Down's"" or are ""mildly pregnant"", or ""you aren't black, not like black-black"". This is not to deny that some of us need way more support than others. That's why the DSM uses support levels now. * She states that neurodiversity advocates think autism ""is just living differently"". This is not true, and possibly a strawman, if intentional. The Neurodiversity movement is **very specifically a disability rights movement. We think that autism is a developmental disability, and no neurodiversity charity has ever stated otherwise.** * She doesn't seem to know if we support treatments or not, clearly demonstrating a lack of research. Neurodiversity advocates support all treatments and therapies that are humane and respect the autistic person's identity and self. * She overplays the ableism we face, by dismissing fears of a ""cure"". In my video, and below(under Nazi Stuff) I talk about why autism rights advocates opposed using the term ""cure"". This is represented in her video as if we believe that autistic people aren't disabled and don't need any help and it's ""just living differently"" but that's nonsense and not actually why we oppose using the term ""cure"". * She talks down to autistic people in the video at several points, dismisses the opinions of autistics on their own disability. * She includes videos on why Autism speaks is bad news, but unfortunately, she either isn't aware of the fact that Autism Speaks is a Eugenics organization pretending to be a charity that helps disabled people, or she doesn't care. The history of eugenics and current attempts at eugenics against us aren't mentioned once. * I didn't respond to this in my video but it irritates the hell outta me that she implies the **only** successful person with classic autism is Temple Grandin(**Wtf**???), and I hope the sheer number of nonspeakers and severely autistic people I included in my video makes up for it. * She never once mentions that neurodiversity advocates are working towards extremely important goals, like ending [the use of electric shock on the handicapped](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Judge_Rotenberg_Educational_Center). She portrays a legitimate civil rights movement for extremely marginalized people as a group of delusional people who think autism is a bed of roses. * She frames the neurodiversity movement as something that blames parents and stands opposed to parents. This is a blatant strawman, and she presents the false choice of having to choose between supporting neurodiversity and blaming parents. Nonsense. Many neurodiversity advocates are parents! * Aside from Greta Thunberg the only neurodiversity supporters she shows are Instagram commenters. Not once is any charity, like The Autistic Society UK, Aspies for Freedom, or the Autistic Self Advocacy Society. Blatant misrepresentation or just ignorance? * She has a huge platform and is using it to misrepresent a civil rights movement for a group of people with an average age of death of 36-38(largely due to suicide) # Nazi Stuff ""Cure"" has been a euphemism for killing, torturing, or otherwise abusing autistics and it's a derogatory term that goes all the way back in autism treatment. Starting with Hans Asperger, the Nazi Doctor who selected which children would be ""cured"" aka euthanized by the child euthanisia program the nazis were running, and which children would be spared death. Blood filtering treatments, feeding children bleach, electric shock treatments, beatings, exorcisms, therapies based on [gay conversion therapy](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Applied_behavior_analysis), and many, many more have been marketed as ""cures"". [The history of controversial therapies marketed as ""cures"" can be found here, on Rationalwiki's page for The Autism Rights Movement.](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Autism_rights_movement) Hypothetical prenatal tests designed to flag autistic fetuses so they cant be aborted have also been called ""cures"" many times, and nazis as well as the alt right have used ""cure"" as a euphemism for the killing of, or abuse of the disabled. Unatural vegan says she supports a prenatal test for autistics, aka ***eugenics***, in her video. **Autistic people can't be cured because autism isn't an illness, it's a permanent developmental disability, like Down's Syndrome.** **Suggesting you can ""cure"" autism is like saying you can unbake a loaf of bread. Autism is how the bread baked in the oven. Can you unboil an egg?** **Would you suggest to a person with Down's that we can change the number of chromosomes they have? No?** This is ***NOT*** to say we oppose legitimate therapies or treatments, we simply oppose the use of the term ""cure"" both for accuracy reasons(legit treatments are called other things) but also because autistic people dislike the history of the term ""cure"" in relation to how it's been used to justify abusing us. Autistic people are still being subject to inhumane ""cures"" ***today***, and for this reason, the term ""cure"" can be triggering for a person who was forced to eat bleach as a child. The term ""cure"" is so widely hated in the autistic community that it has been turned into a slur, ""*curebie*"", which is used in our community to say that we think someone is a eugenicist nazi. If you get called a *curebie* that usually means that the autistic person you're talking to thinks you're a supporter of eugenics. Again, always remember that to us we don't hear cure. We hear ""cure"". It's a Dogwhistle. This is why autism right advocates say, ""Autism is not an *illness*, it does not need a cure."" What we're saying is that it's a ***disability***, and needs to be treated like a ***disability***. Autism, like Down's, is also part of who a person is, and most autistics consider is to be both a disability and a part of our identity. For this reason, implying that a child's disability is a bad thing can be hurtful, and again, you'd never tell a person with Down's, ""I don't hate you, I hate your Down's"" so please don't say things like this to us. Even if you mean well, it's disrespectful. # Terms to use instead: Therapy, speech therapy, CBT, treatments, medications, etc. Literally any other term than the one actual eugenics promoters use. # Why this is important: Myths about the civil rights movement for autistic people are frequently used to dismiss activists. We are facing real issues and just like how conservatives lied about gay rights and trans rights and BLM, they're lying about us. You can find a list of myths about neurodiversity [HERE](http://www.thinkingautismguide.com/p/so-youre-doing-story-about.html) and the position statements of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network [HERE](https://autisticadvocacy.org/about-asan/position-statements/). A lot of alt righters benefit from derailing the autism rights/neurodiversity movements. [Here is an excellent primer on Alt Right figures lying about the autism Rights movement by the Aspergian, a famous Neurodiversity Blog.](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Autism_rights_movement) Help us fight the misinformation. Please don't let uneducated Youtubers promote lies or myths about a very real civil rights movement. Thank you for reading, and watching my video. I'd love it if you shared it because I worked hard on it and he topic is close to my heart.",
792,"What sort of feelings might a young woman have towards the discovery that her SO already has a child and the implications of his (sexual) past that come along with it? Basically, I have two protagonists, an about 18-20 year old young woman and a young man from a wealthy family who is 2 years older than her. Ages can be adjusted as necessary, but I want them around that age and to have that age difference. As the title suggests, I am planning on them eventually getting together and hooking up, albeit it'll be a gradual process in that it probably doesn't happen until some point in the second half of the story. The protagonists were childhood friends who used to get into trouble quite a bit, so they had a delinquent side to them as children and young teens. However, a big incident occurred in their early teens that caused the man to do a complete 180 in terms of personality, in that he became an upstanding young man, very well-liked among many, and very popular in his community. The man has a rather dark past, with some PTSD inducing events in his life as well. He could also have been suicidal in the past due to it. In high school, he was a big man on campus and could have accelerated his education and graduated early. However, in the intervening years, he has been involved in some ""dark incidents"" that have scarred his psyche and left him with some emotional and psychological wounds. In contrast, the woman kept getting into trouble and being delinquent, and in the present, she has brushes with the law. The man's change in demeanor appears to have caused a rift between himself and the woman, as the latter now sees him as a slave to the established order and someone she now has little in common with. Part if the plot would involve both characters reestablishing the close bond they used to have and coming to some common understanding. My thoughts are that the woman didn't have a very easy childhood, in that her mother passed away when she was a young teen and her father buried himself in work partly to cope. I suppose this led to the woman upping her delinquency and acting out and she became distant from her father, who was sort of at his wit's end on what to do about her. As part of her character development, she would sort of clean up her act and rebuild bonds with people she was once close to, including the man, but her father would also pass away at some point early to middle of the story as well. So it's probable that she could be somewhat vulnerable emotionally, even if she tries to hide it. Where it pertains to the topic at hand is this. The protagonists would eventually hook up. My thoughts are that the young woman has little to no experience with actual romance (and perhaps her headstrong and abrasive behavior turns off or scares away boys) and this is her first ""actual relationship. On the other hand, the young man has been through quite a number of relationships, one-night stands, etc. Essentially, he does have quite a sexual history. Not all of it is positive, as he has been taken advantage of a number of times in an emotional or sexual sense. Even though he knew that he was being taken advantage of in some way, he desired the companionship so much that he couldn't being himself to think too hard about other peoples' less than genuine thoughts about him. One big twist in the plot would be that it would emerge that the young man has a young child (probably a daughter) from a past relationship that he previously knew nothing about. My thoughts are that the child's mother may have hidden her pregnancy and then gave the child away for adoption without telling the man, fearing that he might disapprove of the pregnancy and dump her (he wouldn't have done so, but she would not have known this). She would later die in a tragic manner, and it would've been devastating to the man when it happened, since it was one of the vanishingly few deep relationships he had. As for how the man's past lover hid the pregnancy, I haven't fully pinned that down yet. It could be a cryptic pregnancy, meaning it doesn't show even in the late stages (the show ""I Didn't Know I Was Pregnant"" has some examples). Another idea might be that the mother had labor induced early so that she could put up the child for adoption sooner. I suppose it is also possible that some of her friends and confidants conspired to hide the pregnancy or she could have gone on a trip for a while without the man. I also presume that they were both busy with their jobs/education, so sex or deep intimacy wasn't really something they had time for while she was pregnant. I do imagine that the child's mother may have left some notes, letters, or diary entries behind stating her intentions and her feelings of trepidation, fear, and anxiety about the pregnancy and what the man might think. He would of course, read those and come to understand what was going on with his past lover during that time. It is very likely that the man would have married her had she lived, so this could have been hard for him to take in. After discovering this child, I suppose that while the man was a tad upset that his past lover hid her from him and put her up for adoption, he realizes that they were both young(er) and understands that she might have been afraid of what to do about the child. He then resolves to raise the child himself and be a good father, penning out an arrangement with the orphanage to take her for a few days a week until he is older and secure emotionally and mentally to care for her full-time. Money isn't really an object, since as mentioned, the family is wealthy. Of course, one big reason the man wants to are for the child would also be that she is the only thing he has left of her mother, his past deceased lover. He would actually prove to be a good, loving, and caring father to his child. Another reason he wants to care for his child might also just be that she gives him something to live for, considering his past suicidal ideation. My thoughts are that the child herself is probably around 2-3 years old, so she can probably walk and has simple language skills. This of course, causes mixed feelings in the woman. I imagine that she has realized that the man did have a considerable history of previous relationships (and sexual partners), she figured she could overlook this and understood that people hook up and break up a lot. However, the presence of the child now serves as a visible and tangible reminder of this fact and she might feel overwhelmed with the idea that this is her first ""real relationship"" and she now might be expected to be a ""step-mother"" to the child and might not take to the child at least at first. The presence of the child also reminds the woman of the fact that there is just so much about the man's history that she isn't privy to as well, so she could wonder just how much more skeletons he has in the closet. She might also be somewhat jealous of the attention the man is showering on his child. The man, I would imagine, has made it clear to other family and acquaintances that he wants the child in his life and would likely pick the child over the woman if he has to. I guess it's probable that yes, the woman would be resentful of the child or jealous, partly because of the attention the man is giving the child and partly because the child would remind her of his previous relationships. While a tad cliche, I suppose the implication is that the woman is a virgin, having no real romantic experience before hooking up with the man or having any real inclination to be romantic with or hook up with anyone prior to that. Perhaps there's some lingering envy there since the woman might compare herself to her SO's past lovers. So, with that scenario, what are realistic emotions the woman could be expected to feel beyond possible jealousy and being overwhelmed by this child coming into her life, that isn't hers yet she'll likely be expected to be a maternal figure to if she wants the relationship to last (which she does). What might be a nuanced and realistic set of events that might lead her to accept this child that isn't biologically hers and grow to care for her? As mentioned, I would want to emphasize possible resentment to the child at first and that sense of being overwhelmed, as she may just want to experience what being in love and dating is like before moving on to things like moving in together, marriage, and raising a family. The presence of this child obviously throw a huge wrench in all of that. Of course, given that these characters would ultimately deepen their relationship and eventually marry, I would of course, want for the woman to eventually accept the child. This would naturally entail the woman growing to love and care for the child as her own. The tricky part probably is getting to that point and developing it organically. Maybe something perilous happens to the child and she might risk her life to save her. Perhaps seeing how good of a father the man is might make the woman realize that this is the sort of person she'd want to marry and raise a family with. In a sense, the child showing up early in their lives helps the couple figure out what sort of people they'd be in the future as married parents. I suppose I was looking for some opinions on this part of the story because it's a complex subject in my opinion, and something I don't want to botch unintentionally. While you can find some resources on how to get used to or bond with a new stepchild, it's certainly a lot different if say, the couple is rather young, and as mentioned, this child pops into the young woman's life and this is her first relationship and she has no experience looking after children, let alone getting the hang of this dating thing to begin with.",

Osama bin Laden, May 1998 Aside from pursuing mass murder plots against innocent populations in every corner of the planet, Islamic terrorists have one other thing in common: They credit their motivation and success to religion. Islam isn't hijacked by extremists - it is what inspires them. This distinguishes Islamic terrorism from criminal activity, and it is part of what makes Islam so very, very different from other religions. Many people prefer to bury their heads in the sand or look for ways to re-cast Islamic terror to fit their own political agenda. However, Muslims behind the violence are quite explicit about the religious certainty that compels their actions. The teachings and early history of Islam that explain the violence are discussed elsewhere on this site.

794,"4x07 ""407 Proxy Authentication Required"" Honest Reaction & Show Theory by a SurvivorI saw [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MrRobot/comments/dwzddh/mr_robot_4x07_407_proxy_authentication_required/f7xb4jc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) post giving a virtual hug to anyone who's lived through what Elliot has, and I was compelled to share my story as a reaction to this episode. Just a warning, obviously there's spoilers so please don't read unless you've seen the episode in the title. There is also triggering content of the same theme as tonight's episode. This is my reaction to this episode, the storyline of Elliot and Vera that was revealed tonight, my own story as a survivor, how important *Mr. Robot* as a show is for me, other survivors of childhood abuse, and our whole society. Ultimately, though, this a message of gratitude and hope for this show and random kindness of strangers. This show is a remarkably accurate depiction of what it is like to live as a survivor of childhood abuse. I felt compelled to share this because of how deeply visceral my reaction to this episode was. What started out as a simple reply to that virtual hugger soon turned into this. I had to leave this here because I wanted to carry forward what that hugger was doing and what Sam Esmail and everyone who's been making this show has done: to let people like me know *you are not alone*. So here we go... As a survivor of the type of abuse Elliot survived, who recently recovered these memories... I have to be honest. This show is a big part of what helped me recall it. Not all in one night, of course, but over the span of the past two years. I didn't know for the longest time. Like Elliot, there was so much other abuse and neglect that happened to me in my childhood and teen years by those who were supposed to protect me that hid it very well, and that stayed top of mind. I suppose that's deeply what unconsciously grabbed me about this show from the start. There was something there that I *knew*. But I started to have these other memories intrude on me, that I didn't understand, that I couldn't quite place, because shit like this... you just immediately dismiss it when it comes up if your mind isn't prepared to handle it. It's dangerous. It destroys you. You doubt yourself. You drown it out. Tonight's episode is a direction I knew this show was heading from nearly the start. And just like Elliot, I didn't want it to be true. As each season went by, I was living a parallel life, piecing together another part of something I did not want to admit. But as more time went on, and as more events started happening in my life, I couldn't deny it. Because I could see myself in it, in him, in the way Elliot relates to people in the show. The feelings, the hiding, it was all too familiar. Somewhere I knew, but... There comes a point sometimes where you can no longer deny, and it comes up, whether or not you want it to. Just like Vera forcing Elliot open tonight, so the cosmos will act upon you to force you open. I like to think in the show that it's because Elliot *needed* this to happen now. He was becoming lost, going down a dark path, losing sight of his own morality. For me, it started becoming more and more undeniable when seemingly benign things started to trigger strange thoughts within me. Different things like babysitting a friend's 5 year old and seeing their innocence, happiness, joy, total trust... I was like, W*hen did I feel like this? Why don't I have these kinds of memories of being a kid?* Spending time around my family again after a long separation. Looking back at my childhood as an adult and really seeing it for what it was and not how I'd been sugarcoating it to cope in intellectual jargon of ""extreme family and socioeconomic challenges."" Eerie feelings of sexual abuse started coming up. I started questioning it... *is this child that I'm watching being abused and I'm picking up on something? Am I misreading something? Am I seeing something that isn't there? Am I reading too much into this? Where is this coming from? Is this real?* Then it all slowly started clicking together. The child I was watching wasn't the one who was being abused. The child I was watching was near the age I was when I have my first memory of abuse. It would be many more months before I could admit this to myself. But the memories started flooding back. In my dreams, in my meditation, intruding into my regular thoughts, random things triggering me. I tried to run from them, but once it opens, you cannot put it back. But I tried very hard to. The more I denied it, the worse I felt, the more paranoid I became. I started projecting all of my mistrust onto the world at large, my senses heightened by the memories locked in my body that were begging to be let out. It would be a year of feeling like I was going crazy, watching myself lose control over my entire life right before my very eyes, unable and helpless to stop it. Being blamed for it. Trying to find out more information that would contradict it, and to my horror, only finding out information that confirmed it. I kept running away. But one night a bit over two months ago, shortly after rewatching all three seasons of *Mr. Robot*, I couldn't run anymore. Everything caught up with me at once, and I stopped questioning if it was real or not and let myself remember. My parent's drug-addict ex-partner (now dead) used to watch me as a young child and would sexually abuse me, right while his mother, who had schizophrenia, sat in the other room, chain smoking and talking to herself. I was 5. It had been going on for years. Questions that I asked my parent confirmed that it was happening since I was an infant, and worse, that he was taking photographs of me. Realizing the truth of what had happened, I felt like every molecule of my existence was being ripped apart from its bonds and that I would just cease to exist. I cannot put into words, really, how it felt. I told some close friends very shortly after I recovered the actual memories... one friend has been phenomenal. I am beyond grateful for them. Another who I thought was a really solid friend basically made me feel like I was lying and dismissed me. That hurt almost as much as the abuse... but then I knew. *A person who responds this way isn't ready to deal with a similar experience of their own.* But not everyone can be so understanding of other people in that scenario so... if anyone reading this happens to have gone through a similar thing... just know that it's not your fault if anyone does that or reacts like that, and you're very likely just mirroring their own pain to them that they might not be ready to deal with. I'm still really hurt and confused by it and don't know how to talk them anymore now. I feel vulnerable and let down and humiliated. It felt for a few weeks like the abuse was happening all over again, because it made it so obvious to me that's exactly the fear I'd been holding as a kid this whole time: *no one will believe me*. I might understand my friend's reaction but still, I have to learn how to be okay to have my own feelings. Even still, in a way, while it still hurts, I'm grateful that it happened, because it mirrored back to me how real this was. The feeling of someone denying your truth only amplifies and clarifies what's real. That is why what Esmail, Malek, Villar, and Reuben (Krista) have created here in this episode and throughout the whole show is a fucking masterpiece depiction and is literally something that has made me feel not alone in my own life. Because this is one of the most isolating experiences a person can ever have. You feel like no one will understand, that somehow it's your fault, that you should have been able to change things. None of that is true, but when you are living it... it's very much your reality. **Tonight, when Elliot was crying and screaming ""I don't know who I am!! I don't know how to live with this!!"" <--- that is the fucking real shit.** Because it's true. I don't know who I am. Everything I've ever done, accomplished, and lost, every relationship I've ever had, I see I just put myself again and again into this vulnerable situation to be abused. I was *so fucking close* of finally being totally free of it when somehow I just got roped right back into abusive family patterns. And I was so naive. I knew something was off but I couldn't see it. But if that didn't happen... I don't know if I would have recovered the memories when I did, because I would still be idealizing my parent and family and making excuses for their failing to protect me. I've gone back and forth feeling like it's a good thing and feeling like ""now I finally understand why people say ignorance is bliss."" Because of the slow burn of this realization over two years and getting sucked back into abusive family shit, I gave up my education at my top dream school because I started believing them again: *I would never amount to anything and who did I think I was to even try*. Imposter syndrome set in, I started thinking, *They're all going to find out I'm just a worthless nothing and nobody. Why am I even trying to pretend to be normal? I'm not like these people. I can't change anything.* Education I had to fight so hard to get against all odds and at my total expense. A major part of my abuse was not being allowed to go to school when that's all I ever wanted to do. I was taken out of high school and not allowed to go back. I eventually went on my own to get my GED, graduate college, and start graduate school. And this is when my abuser saw I was almost free as an adult and manipulated me in the way they knew how, and I was helpless to resist. And they did it in the worst possible way. They told me that they knew they had been a bad parent and wanted to make up for it now. They wanted to support me now. Like Edward, they said they wanted to ""protect me and help me and that they loved me and wanted me to succeed."" They pretended to be proud of me, they said all the right things that I desperately wanted to hear. But it was all a lie. Once I moved back into their ""supportive"" reach, it all came crashing down. Their lie was exposed. And then they blamed me for it, said I should have known better, and mocked me saying, ""How much is your education going to save you now?"" This almost broke me. I was trying so hard to make this parent proud of me, giving them another chance after how many broken chances to be a good person and do the right thing. To find out it had all just been a sick, twisted power play was almost too much to handle. I almost ended my life. But all of that was a necessary lesson for me to see myself more clearly, even as much as it hurt and I didn't want it to be true. That's when the memories of my abuse first started to resurface. I started to remember what I went through, how my parent pulled me out of school for 6 months and let their random partner abuse me at 9. How they would do sexual things in the bed next to me while the partner would tell me I was worthless and I was lucky to even be there. My parent let them abuse me physically and never stopped it. All the neglect, never having enough food, never being allowed to have friends, it all started rushing back. But there was something deeper that I could feel, glimpses of something I couldn't quite catch, something earlier. Something I didn't want to admit or see. That deeper, younger trauma that still lurked, waiting to be recognized. All along, I'm watching *Mr. Robot* and being a total superfan over the cinematography and storyline the greater social implications of what's discussed in the show. Just like any other vice, I at first let that distract me from the deeper grit being discussed. But it was more than that for me. The more I watched, the more I saw this story *was* me. Granted, I'm only an elite hacker in my dreams (lol), but even that aspect quietly echoed some of my life. When I wasn't allowed to finish high school, I'd sit in my room and teach myself to code and talk online to people. To this day, it's a lot easier to open up through a keyboard than my mouth. Watching *Mr. Robot* brought me to the hard realization that I don't know how to have friends or to really trust people. Somewhere deep inside, I am always waiting for the trauma to happen again. That's the most horrible part of abusers. They take from us before we even have a chance to know ourselves, to build ourselves, to learn how to love ourselves. And because it gets buried deep in our unconscious to protect what we can't handle as children, and we bury it deeper with every manner of coping mechanism available as we grow, we keep playing that role in our relationships. And then we get blamed for outbursts when we don't even understand our own emotions or why we are so damn upset, or why certain things are triggering us so hard. The way Elliot would cry and ask ""what do normal people do when they feel this lonely?"" *That* crying alone and not even knowing why... that has been my life. That pain has been my only constant friend. Like Elliot, my early childhood abuser is dead. I can never confront them. I can never have the closure that would come from holding them accountable directly. I don't even know where they're buried, and if I did I might go pull a Whiterose and piss on their grave. I cried so hard tonight along with Elliot. I weeped seeing in his face the emotions that I felt just barely over two months ago when I could no longer keep inside what has always been there. When I let my body remember it and let my mind *see it.* When I let myself finally admit it. But I wept the most after watching Vera die by Krista stabbing him when he least expected it, at the apex of his abuse of Elliot, watching *someone step in and protect someone vulnerable*. And even though this is just a show and a fictional story, the truth is—***so much of this is all a true story to countless silent invisible victims who don't get any closure or who die with their secrets and can't cope with their pain and drink and smoke and swallow pills to keep it all down or can't take it anymore and end their lives. Either way, you slowly kill yourself when you can't face this and the tragedy is so many people don't even know why.*** Krista killing Vera felt like it was avenging ***ME*** and what I survived. It was avenging me not just of my original abuser who took my innocence before I even started grade school, or my parent who did nothing to stop it and abused me themselves. It was avenging all the abusers I ever had in relationships that somehow could just smell that vulnerability on me and took advantage of it... that shit has been extremely difficult to come to terms with, how much of my life has been lost and destroyed because of opportunistic, narcissistic abusers like Vera, even some of my own family members. How much of my life was lost because I didn't learn how to make better decisions, because I didn't have any healthy guidance. Vera being killed was a cathartic symbolic emotional representation of the protection I never got, that *every single human being deserves to have.* **And THAT is the power of art. THAT is the power of art to change the world, to change people's lives, to make them feel real again, human again, connected again,** ***seen again***\*\*.\*\* And to the random human being Redditor who inspired me to share this, you with your virtual hug left for whoever needed it, is actually a lot more fucking meaningful that you probably can know. I'm sharing all this because just like I saw that comment, I want to leave this here so anyone else who went through this knows... you aren't alone either. ***We can fucking make it. We are survivors.*** Vera was a narcissistic abusive piece of shit. But that doesn't mean he was all wrong. This pain we have inside of us can become our deepest source of strength. We just have to see it, sit with it, and accept it. We have to own it, instead of letting our abusers own us. ***We can learn how to own ourselves.*** But unlike Vera was trying to twist Elliot into doing, we must not become the thing that hurt us the most. That's what Vera's storyline is. He was abused and used as a child, too. That's been his ""cosmic, spiritual connection"" speech this whole time. But unlike Vera, killing people, smoking meth, dealing drugs, ruining people's lives—Vera is a warning tale that we must not cope with our abuse in unhealthy ways. Because that's the real hard story here with Elliot. He did so many questionable things for the right reasons, to regain his sense of power and control over his life that was taken from him. But the more obsessed he became with unconsciously avenging his childhood trauma, the more he became like the very abuser and manipulator that hurt him. That's what he did to Olivia. That's why Edward was saying ""this is crossing a line."" Edward knew that this would be the thing to finally open the curtain to him, because it would be far too close to the truth: knowing someone's vulnerability in the most intimate way and intentionally violating it for selfish gain, power, control, or pleasure. The ends **never** justify the means when it comes to this. I almost don't even want to watch the rest of the show. I'm scared of what might happen to Elliot. I want him to survive, I want him to make it out of this, I want him to win. But because I know that feeling, I know it's just as equally likely that he takes back the ultimate control by ending his own life. I don't want the story to go that way. But it could. That *is* the ultimate control: ""No one is going to hurt me anymore, no one is going to make me feel this pain anymore. This is my life on my terms."" But no matter how it ends (and of course I'm going to watch because, *come on*), this show has made me realize something very important, even as it helped me come to terms with my own abuse: I am not alone and even if there are people in my life want to deny the truth of my survival or those who enabled it to happen who won't take responsibility, there is someone out there named Sam Esmail who had the immense courage to create and tell this important story that needed to be told in a mass way. There are a lot of people who helped make this show, and all of them worked so hard to tell this story that needed to be told in such an epic, wonderfully executed way. And not only that, there's a bunch of random strangers on here who actually care enough to just say kind words. ***Those words mean a lot.*** So even if there are ones in my life who can't sit with my truth because of their pain, I know there's a whole bunch of people out there who are brave enough to not just sit with it, but to go through the pain, agony, and emotion to live it, breathe it, and act it out... not just to entertain us. *Mr. Robot* is a deeply artistic, philosophical, human study of power, abuse, control, manipulation, and how it runs our collective and individual lives. It is not just here for mere entertainment, and to keep it on that surface level is to miss so much being said. It's all these things, but it's also here to let people like me know that I'm not alone, and to hopefully plant a seed of compassion in the hearts of those who thankfully didn't have Elliot's world as their reality, so they can understand just even a fraction of what it's like for us who did. And that's enough to keep me going right now and get back up. I don't know what I'll do with my life, and maybe that's okay right now. Maybe now I have to learn who I am, who I want to be, and just let it happen. All I know right now is: this is the best television show in the history of forever. It has saved my life in no uncertain way and I will remain forever grateful to everyone who had a hand in creating it. *Thank you.* *For anyone struggling to cope with anything like this, always remember that you aren't alone:* [National Suicide Prevention Lifeline](http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/) Call 1-800-273-8255 \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* **Update 4 days later**: Wow.

795,"[PubQ] Query Critique 62K LitFic/Memoir hybridAfter 10 years, I think I'm finally able to start querying my book. I won't go into why it took me so long to get where I am now, but it was a necessary journey. I came across this sub today, and I have to admit I am kind of excited to have my basic query letter read for trash. Feel free to trash the book concept as well. First, I have to ask one thing: I've been customizing the first paragraph of the query to address why I picked the agent I am sending it to. Mistake or good tactic? Secondly and finally, here's the majority of what I've been sending out. I've only been querying for a week and have no responses to gauge any changes off of. So yeah, destroy me.

Prior to bearing witness to this crime, I was sexually abused as a child. In the years after, I watched powerless to intervene as a fellow US Navy Sailor committed suicide on my watch. In spite of these events, I have discovered that there is good in the world, and that life is worth living. Writing this book is how I came to this realization. The goodness of life does not come from the belief in any sort of god, but in what we make of our existence. > > The first half of GOD NO MORE is a parable. A fictionalized version of myself, NONCOGNITON, is an alcoholic, depressed writer. Clearly, this is an unexplored archetype, as no one who drinks can write well. NONCOG is intent on committing suicide after his best friend’s wedding. After waking up from a night of binge drinking at the bachelor party, the two pass out in his living room. When he awakes the next morning, NONCOG finds that his unconscious roommate has been replaced by a stranger. This stranger introduces himself as God. > > As it turns out, the stories we’ve been told about God are all wrong. He’s not as omnibenevolent as we have been led to believe. God loves a good practical joke. However, He is not entirely without compassion, but the eons of dealing with His silly apes has caused God to become a bit jaded. Having reached His breaking point with our shit, God has turned in His resignation. God is only stopping by NONCOG’s apartment to turn over the keys to the office and provide some parting wisdom to His successors. > > After a discussion about the difficulties in proving who He says He is, God persuades NONCOG to believe in Him through non-conventional miracles, and by exposing an embarrassing secret from NONCOG’s past. God then further proves his godhood by taking NONCOG on a journey back to the creation of the universe, and a trek across the surface of a primordial Earth. > > During the journey, God and NONCOG discuss how humanity’s behavior has caused the sorry state of existence in NONCOG’s world. Presented as a Platonic dialogue, our dialectic duo covers the nature of human behavior, and how it can be modified to make our world a better place. The truth comes out that defining morality is mankind’s responsibility alone. Since we cannot know the mind of God, there is no need to believe in Him. > > Instead of disappearing in a puff of logical smoke, God explains the reason why He still exists. All human thought is memetic, and He only persists because of the faith that's been placed in Him. Because we are forced to look at our existence through the lens of mortality, we tend to latch onto things that allow us to cope with the fact that we’re all going to die someday. The only way we can defeat this fear of death is through making our lives as best we can, with the power of love. > > The memoir half of the book deals with how I, the non-fictional NONCOG, have come to believe this. My past, while painful to relive, has given me a way to find hope, even when the world seems so dark. God abandoned me when I needed Him most, at a church service the day after the shooting. I was raised as an Evangelical, the type of Christian that most believes in an interceding God. When he left me alone with my grief, I opened my eyes to other possibilities.

And yet now, after the Epstein case, most of you are beginning your comments with ""I'm not a Conspiracy Theorist but..."". Oh how the turn tables have...naah, I'll skip the meme for a change. Let me educate you about a pattern that we've all observed. First - they call it a conspiracy theory. Then - once the truth starts trickling out, they say, ""Oh c'mon! This was never really a conspiracy theory. Everyone with a brain knew that."" There was a time when nobody believed that the US was doing extremely inhuman things to people as part of their defense experiments. It was just us ""tinfoil hatters."" Then, it all turned out to be true. Then everyone was like, ""Meh. Everyone knew about it."" Then the same thing happened when us ""nutters"" warned people that they were being electronically spied on. Again, the story repeated. Then we warned the world about Elite Paedophiles and their horrifying Satanic Ritual Sacrifices. The former is now front page news. The latter will eventually follow. It has to.

Similarly, you probably still haven't noticed as to how the r/911truth subreddit got mercilessly quarantined by Reddit - with a lot of cheers coming their way for that. The exact same Reddit, which is also combing interesting comments calling out the Epstein ""suicide"" BS across r/news, r/worldnews, r/politics, and like a shit ton of other places. But soon, I assure you all, I'll hear you say, ""Oh c'mon! Everyone has been saying Bush did 9/11 since like forever."" So there's the facts. I know that you are going to continue making fun of us ""tinfoil hatters"" or whatever or say that we are only forwarding some specific political party's agenda (I'll be honest here - there are many on this sub who do have such agendas. But NOT ALL of them are like that.) You are also going to cheer out loud if/as/when Reddit blocks us for having a (planted) hate post or comment or literally anything else in the future - in much the same manner as violent folks get ""planted"" to discredit peaceful protests, which are then quashed violently by the cops in ""retaliation"". You are also going to laugh as your rights get taken away and eventually, your dignity and safety and everything else you hold dear. So here are a few more things for you to know of right away - so that the next time you claim that ""everyone knew it perfectly well all along"" - at least we ""*retarded tinfoil hatters""* can *buy that shit.* 1. ALL of your media is controlled. ALL news is planted. ALL headlines are perfectly chosen to brainwash you in a specific way. So, the next time you ""debunk"" something by giving out a ""source"" i.e. a ""trustworthy news link"" - you are fooling nobody. And don't even get me started on *Snopes* and their agenda. 2. If you still think that you are living in a ""democracy"", where things happen by rule (unlike Russia/China/North Korea which are evil places manipulated by evil folks) - I may have some bad news for you. The Epstein incident should be eye-opener enough for you. 3. Nearly all shootings that happen in your country of US are *manipulated* to achieve the gun-control objective. So that people have no means to defend themselves when the government ultimately decides to invade them. Trial runs of these things are managed in countries such as New Zealand - which was a massive success because their (both literal as well as metaphorical) ""sheep population"" willingly bought it in one go. Either psychologically imbalanced individuals are targeted, drugged, brainwashed and manipulated into doing this or hired sharpshooters are dedicated to the cause. Other side-objectives such as having a shooter of <insert race/religion here> are also achieved simultaneously for the purpose of spreading hate and fear. 4. You have been lied to regarding the TRUTH about MH 370 and the MH 17 incidents. Yep, your folks had had something (all of it) to do with that. 5. The entire 9/11 story is a fabrication. 6. The British Royal Family, the Obamas, the Clintons, the Trumps, and, sorry to add, even Bernie Sanders are all part of the same elite circles that do horrible things. Because unless you aren't a part of the elite, you wouldn't even get CLOSE to the presidential race, let alone the presidential nomination. 7. Feminism/feminists is manipulated and controlled by these folks to create further gender-wars and divide. (You can see how manipulated they are that they actually try to sell you the ridiculous idea that the Burqa/Hijab/Niqab is some form of women's empowerment). The response to it (Meninism) is also ""founded and run"" by these same folks. Black people, White people, Sikhs, Muslims, Christians - ALL are attacked under the orders of the very same people. If you have seen women replacing men as superheroes and other characters in movies (Ghostbusters, Oceans 8) - it is part of that DIVIDE AND CONQUER agenda. Gender pay gap is also a part of that exact same agenda. Meanwhile, they continue to oppress women on the side by denying them abortion rights, mistreating them etc and play both sides of the game. The same applies to black guys suddenly getting to play originally white characters. It's all manufactured to generate outrage, divide and rule. **[This ad is an excellent example of the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0)** 8. *Nearly* all rich and famous folks (the coveted 1%) are part of the ""dark side"" in some way or the other. Yes - you are going to see folks of the likes of Bill Gates, Warren Buffet for what they TRULY are to get ousted pretty soon. Don't say we didn't warn you later. 9. Forced vaccination is a plan for something a lot, a LOT more nefarious than Autism. The Autism nonsense is just to keep people distracted from the real deal. 10. Point no.9 mentioned above and Elon Musk's Neuralink are, well, *linked* very closely. 11. Sorry, but global warming is a hoax too. These people you have put all of your faith in - these scientists, these researchers, these ""experts"" - when their true allegiances are revealed to you, you are going to feel, really, really stupid. The real thing that is causing a lot of this world's problems is something known as HAARP - but hey, can't have YOU FOLKS knowing THAT now, can we? 12. If you see someone's image being marketed as that of a ""good guy"" for *far too long* - expect it to be the exact opposite in reality. Looking at you, Pope Francis, Barack Obama, Malala, United Nations and NATO. 13. Some people take on a ""good guy image"" (Elon Musk). So that once the public fully begins to trust their intentions, they can give you your personalized eternal slavery toolkits such as Neuralink™. 14. People like Alex Jones - and the real-life ""tinfoil hatters"" have been created to discredit/mock the actual awakened *conspiracy community*. Yes, we do have some folks who believe in baseless stuff without anything legitimate to back that up, but they are not the majority. 15. This is the opposite of point #12. People who DO speak the truth, are branded by the powers-in-control as loons, addicts, or retards. Whatever suits their causes the best. E.g. Jim Carrey, Russel Brand, Kanye West, etc. Can't have these folks spilling all the beans now, can they? 16. Celebrities who DO wish to tell the world the truth get killed. Usually through the kind of technologies that killed Osho (via giving him cancer), or the stuff that has been used to drain Julian Assange of his very life force (he'll probably not live too long either), and so on and so forth. They killed Michael Jackson. They also killed Robin Williams. And they also ""suicided"" a bunch of bankers not too long ago. Sometimes, they just shoot them in plain sight like they did with that one President dude called Kennedy. 17. The Large Hadron Collider/Particle Accelerator had WAY more nefarious purposes than what you'd ever believe to be true. 18. We have had the technology (obtained by reverse engineering) to visit Moon/Mars/Outer Reaches of our Solar System since a LONG, LONG time. So while the Moon mission wasn't exactly fake - it didn't show to the world what we really have. Or how often we use what we have to travel through this Solar System at mind-bending speeds. 19. The Moon isn't what you think it is. 20. Last but not the least, aliens exist. Always have. And many of them are literally light years ahead of us - both technologically, as well as spiritually. Deal with it. This is by NO MEANS an exhaustive list. I just dropped the most important things that came to my mind at this time. There are many, many, many, many more things I could tell you but that would go on forever. Long story short, don't you *for a single second* believe that you are living in a world that is any different than what was described in the book 1984. Don't you *for a single second believe* that ""Russia"" is the only evil, dictatorial place where people get ""suicided"" and America's some kind of a *heaven.* Really, just *don't.* Because all of your delusions are about to get uprooted, real fast, real hard. All of your bankers, your pharma companies, your petroleum companies, your Nestle's and McDonalds and Cokes, your fancy fashion brands, your media, your educational systems, your scientific fraternity, your governments, your armies, your spy services, your police forces, your military-industrial complex, your religions, your politicians, your ""justice"" systems, and your *everything* is corrupted to its very core. This applies across countries, across borders, across the world. The ones of lesser light see humanity as slaves - and are wiling to do anything to use us for their greed, lust and even entertainment. **You have been manipulated physically, psychologically, socially and even** ***CHEMICALLY AND BIOLOGICALLY*** **to the extent that even your DNA and your VERY SOUL has not remained untouched by their advanced nefarious technologies.** It is up to you to either sit in quiet acceptance of it, or to **do something about it before it takes away everything you have ever loved or valued.** **DISCLAIMER:** Just because evil has infiltrated and rotted everything in existence, does not mean that there are no good people left. In fact, without the good people, our world would be a 100% hell right now. So let me make it very, very clear that GOOD PEOPLE STILL DO EXIST. In your politics, in your Nestles and Cokes, in your police forces, in your armed forces, in your governments, in your spy forces, in your media, in your judicial systems, in your scientific field, in your educational fields, in your NASA, in your UN and even in your religions. Without these folks being there to balance things out, we'd all probably be COMPLETELY FUCKED AS A SPECIES by now. But these good people are usually powerless because as of yet, Earth is still under the rule of darker forces (such as the Illuminati etc) - and other good people from all across the world haven't joined hands yet to become a SINGLE, POWERFUL, INDESTRUCTIBLE FORCE that the negative ones COULDN'T EVEN TOUCH. Because most of them are still buying into all those hate and division games. The day they wake the fuck up, is the day we'll be liberated as a species... Have a good day. **EDIT:** To those asking me to give proofs of my claims, or asking me to explain to them more about the moon, the Hadron Collider etc. I am *so not* going to do any of that. Try living **our life** for once. Go into the rabbit-holes of the internet, the YouTubes, the blogs and even the 4chans and the 8chans that you so despise. **READ** people's arguments for yourselves. **ANALYSE** the evidences presented. **FIGURE THINGS OUT** on your own. **THAT'S HOW YOU WILL AWAKEN.** Not by someone spoon-feeding you everything and you either (blindly) buying it, or else (blindly) rejecting it. THAT MENTALITY is what has got all of us here in the first place. Where everybody (blindly) believes their media, their governments, their politicians, their scientists, their celebrities, their teachers, their religious leaders and even their psychologists. Where everybody (blindly) believes in their society, their friends, their moms, their dads, their siblings and absolutely anyone else - WITHOUT GOING OUT THERE AND LOOKING UP/VERIFYING SHIT FOR THEMSELVES. And then we have a sleeping civilization that will believe in *literally anything.* Sorry, ain't gonna contribute to that madness. **EDIT 2:** So I found a few recurring themes/questions coming up within this post. I would be more than happy to address some of those. **Question 1:** Why you no provide proof? **Answer 1:** Hold it right there. Do you really think that when conspiracy theorists were making claims about Jeffrey Epstein WAY back - that they were doing so without posting proof? Oh, let me give you a better example. Julian Assange and Edward Snowden (along with us ""nutcases"") were *screaming from rooftops* telling people they were being spied on. Entire troves of documents and other *proofs* accompanied their words. Did you all for a single second believe them? No, right? And what happened ultimately? They were proven all right, right? So don't you for a *single second* feign all of that ""innocence"" and *ask me for proofs* now when all you have done is *disregard* proofs for the entirety of your lives. Besides, we are all just *nutcases* here right? Why would you even believe someone you have already labelled a nutcase? That would be ridiculous. **Question 2:** But muh Donald Trump is *innocent.* **Answer:** *Is he?* Kindly go look up his attitude towards Saudi Arabia, his trigger-happy, war-friendly stance towards Iran, and report back to me regarding his true allegiances at your leisure. Get out of this ""Republican good, Democrat bad"" and ""Democrat good, Republican bad"" nonsense already. Because while you are busy defending their asses here, they are all just thinking of newer and better ways to trample yours. Yes, both of them. Sorry to break that to ya. **Question 3:** Do you really believe in Satan, it's 2019? **Answer 3:** Accepting that Satanic Rituals exist is not the same thing as accepting Satan exists. There are plenty, plenty of stories, witness accounts and testimonials about those out there. **Entire books have been written about the said rituals - and MANY at that.** And where there's smoke - there's usually fire. Go figure. **Question 4:** Doesn't your mentioning the moon completely ruin the whole point of this post? **Answer 4:** This one's the one that brought me the most laughs. Because I haven't even mentioned a *single theory* about the moon in this post. I haven't said whether the moon is hollow or not, or whether it is flat or not, or whether it is a ""projection"" or not. And yet, people here are already, well, ""projecting"" rather hard about what I *might have* intended to say. Perhaps it is indeed a projection then? Lol. See, this is why I left some of the stuff here open-ended. So that you lot here can come and project your preconceived notions and prejudices about such topics yet again. So that you can (already) decide as to what is ""believable"" and what sounds way too ""out there"" for your tiny minds to comprehend. But hey, there was a time when the idea that the government was spying on you was way too *""out there""*. Go figure. **Question 5:** Yes to everything except the Vaccination Part, the Global Warming part and the <insert name of concept ""sold"" to you by your mainstream media, social media, literally all scientists, literally all celebrities, literally all your friends, and even your neigbhbour's 3-day old puppy>. **Answer 5:** So you have already decided that you know everything about those topics. And clearly, since absolutely everyone upon this planet accepts them - they can't all be wrong, right? Let me give you an example to illustrate this point a tad better. Almost everyone on your planet agrees that believing in fairy tales and magic and any other ""out there"" concepts is either for kids or druggies or for complete retards. That believing in ""imaginary stuff"" makes you immature, stupid and dumb AF. **Strange then, that nearly all (so-called) ""mature, grown adults"" upon this planet** who are all intelligent ""homo-sapiens and everything"" **believe in imaginary borders, imaginary separations** between religion, creed, race, gender and whatnot **and buy all of those imaginary dreams** such as the American Dream/or that the ""media never lies"" and more. How wise and mature of them. **Question 6:** Why the fuck would the elite do all of this shit openly? They knew the entire country was watching them here. They'd be stupid to even try. **Answer 6:** Two reasons. I'll address the first one first. The reason that our Elite do a lot of things is NOT about whether it's the best thing to do or not. The reason is to remind the world just how very fucking powerful and untouchable they are. That they can get away with **absolutely anything,** right in front of humanity's noses and people will still buy all their BS and suck on their dicks at the end of the day. This is why they were so happy about ""predicting 9/11"" in like a ton of different places (yeah, WAY too many ""coincidences"" happening in there for all of these things to be organically happening) be it comics, cartoons, movies, or what-have-you. Manipulating entertainment to suit their agenda is something they have always done. The guys over at Disney would love to tell you how well they've all gotten at this shit. **They are ALL on the power-trip of a lifetime where no matter WHAT they do and HOW BLATANTLY THEY DO IT - humanity all laps it up and** ***worships*** **them regardless.** THIS IS WHY they thought offing Epstein right under the entire world's noses was a good idea. Alas! Times are a changin - and they are changing fast! And as their ship is fast sinking now, expect them to do many, many more such stupid things in desperation that only have an opposite effect to that which they had intended. For, as that recent movie title would gladly remind you, we are truly in the ""Endgame"" now. And nope, that title was no ""coincidence"" either. The reasons they do all of those horrifying paedo-sex-and-torture-ritual-cult-blood-sacrifice ceremonies is NOT because all of them were organically born as child rapists. The reasons they do it is for their *initiation.* To filter out the darkest from the dark. For only the greatest of psychopaths and monsters can even as much as *imagine* participating in one of those psychotic ceremonies. And then they continue to force these ""initiates"" into doing this on a regular basis to forever ensure that these people are still ""on their (dark) side"" and as leverage against them if any of them ever decides to turn against them. Hope this is making some sense to you now. **Question 7:** Why TF are you making all of these tall claims? YOU are the one discrediting the community now. **Answer 7:** AM I? Here's a suggestion. Save this post. Try your best to survive for the next 10 years. Okay, let's just make it 5 years. And then, watch in horror as a ton of things mentioned herein get revealed to you. I hope 5 years isn't too much of a stretch for you. Because this entire revealing process might well take a 50 or even a 100. Why? Because the hiding has been going on for entire fucking millenia. So for the revealing to just take about a 100 is a massive achievement already. But I am not saying you have to wait that long. **You will get more than what you bargained for within the next 5 years alone.** That I guarantee you. So yeah, go convert this thread into a checklist. And begin ticking off items as and when they happen. I assure you, *I* won't be the one disappointing you here. Can't really say the same for your leaders, your businessmen, your doctors, your scientists, your judges, your media, etc. though.",
797,"Three-Way Traffic AheadAll serious runners are a little crazy. Monday evening I watched a runner dive into a street in downtown Argenta. Friday evening I made up my mind to try it myself, despite the danger. By ""dive into a street"" I don't mean she leaped off a skyscraper. (Argenta's tallest building, the six-story Makepeace Tower, is high enough for a suicide, but nobody's ever jumped from it.) Loping along, she sort of ducked her head and disappeared downward. From my viewpoint she sank straight into the street, still running. Galumphing a block behind her, I gaped at what had to be an optical illusion. Still, I slowed, half-expecting to find a new sinkhole devouring runners on JFK. (With so many limestone caves under the Ozarks, it's surprising Arkansas doesn't have more sinkholes.) The asphalt was unbroken&mdash;but the woman was gone. At the next intersection she was nowhere in sight. I made my usual right turn onto Fifth, crossing over to Argenta Avenue to loop back to my office on Bella Vista. No cars had been passing; there's no curb parking along the ""shared-use"" lane of JFK. She had to have turned into a building or something. But it bugged me, as any unexplained illusion can. **** Driving home, I noticed something: Someone with a spray can had altered one of the warning signs where one-way traffic on JFK ends. Instead of TWO-WAY TRAFFIC AHEAD, it now read *3*-WAY TRAFFIC AHEAD. The sign stood mid-block, just before where I'd seen the woman disappear. Odd thing was, I recognized the style of the *3*. Most people draw a *3* as two big loops joined in the middle. But this *3*'s upper loop consisted of a flat top bar and a hard slash down to the left, a sharp dramatic shape I'd seen only one person use, one of my coworkers. Eddie Lee, though, didn't seem the sort to deface traffic signs, so I dismissed the thought. **** Running in downtown isn't particularly fun. The city forbids running on the regular sidewalks. On the few streets with shared-use lanes, cyclists are more of a hazard than cars. But streets where I live are even worse, hilly and narrow, so I run downtown after office hours, dodging bikes and utility work. Tuesday I didn't see the woman, but I studied the altered sign. It really did seem to mark where she'd disappeared, as though the ""third way"" took you underground. Wednesday I put another thought with that one. I'm the sort who's glad the word *jogging* has gone out of style. As an overweight forty-something desk jockey, I'm grateful even my huffing efforts to run a 5K with a thirteen-oh pace merit the dignified title of *runner*. But Eddie Lee Baker is a real runner, marathons and hill climbs and Ragnars and such. He knows all the serious runners in the area, knows the best routes&mdash;and knows the secrets. In Argenta there are tourists (lots) and transplants (often graduates of the university). There are locals who grew up here. Then there are *natives,* who grew up here&mdash;*and absorbed the stories.* Eddie Lee and I are natives. We know which road over Grace Mountain is said to move, what nights to stay out of the National Forest north of the lake. We learned the tales as kids, from grandparents, from schoolmates (from my seventh-grade teacher, in one case). So I didn't hesitate, Wednesday afternoon, to tell Ed, ""I saw a woman running on JFK disappear."" He took it coolly, scrolling an open spreadsheet. ""Oh, yeah?"" ""Is that your *3* on the sign between Fourth and Fifth? 'Cause that's where she disappeared."" Now I had his interest. ""*You* were running? You must've really been in the zone. You shouldn't'a seen that."" He looked me over. ""You take running seriously?"" ""Not by your standards. It kills me to break thirteen minutes a mile in a 5K."" ""Pace's got nothing to do with dedication."" He leaned back. ""You got gear here? Come running with me after work."" He saw my look, grinned. ""Don't worry about keeping up with me. I just want to see how you run."" **** Whether or not my schedule calls for a run, I keep a gear bag in the car. I changed after work and met Eddie Lee at the back door. ""Show me your route,"" he said. ""Just pretend I'm a coach."" After a few stretches and a couple of blocks walking, I started my usual 3.4-mile route through downtown. Ed paced me easily, made no comment when I dropped into a walk interval, effortlessly ramped back up for my second run interval. On JFK, I pointed ahead. ""That's where she vanished,"" I panted. He nodded. ""That's the spot."" Back at the office, he told me, ""You don't cheat on your intervals. You *increased* your pace that last run interval. What's your overall pace?"" I checked my Garmin. ""13:27&mdash;hey, that's not bad!"" ""You act like you're serious."" ""I've dropped my resting heart rate by ten beats since I started."" ""If you're really serious, I can put you on a track hardly anybody knows."" He jerked a thumb toward our building. ""Come by my desk tomorrow."" **** From a drawer he pulled a little medallion on a leather thong. He kept his voice low. ""This opens the path. Just run past my big *3* and you'll see."" I bounced it in my palm; it was heavy, solid metal. ""It's kinda dangerous,"" he said. ""Not running-on-the-freeway dangerous, more like rock climbing. Just keep your head."" I didn't like that. ""We talking twist-an-ankle dangerous, or get-dead dangerous?"" He answered with a question. ""How long can you run? You can't do walk intervals down there."" ""I don't know, maybe ten minutes? Under a mile, for sure."" ""Follow the yellow blazes, then. And anyplace there's a bench, it's safe to stop. But don't stop *anyplace* else; don't even walk. You're safe as long as you don't panic and don't give up&mdash;but *don't stop.* Keep running, no matter what."" ""Do you run down there?"" ""Yeah, but you and I can't run together. I'm too much faster; I can't risk waiting for you."" **** I'd have thought he was pulling my leg, but I'd seen that woman sink into the pavement. The circular medallion was two-sided. One side was sculpted as a cluster of quartz crystals, the other looked like a cave passage with stalactites and stalagmites, images both appropriate to the Ozarks. Friday after work I decided to try it. I geared up, and slipped the leather cord over my head, a tight fit, then inside my jacket. Striding up Bella Vista through a cold breeze, I ran a quick mental inventory: ankles, knees, back; wind, gut, heart. I was ready to run. I shortened my first run interval so I'd hit the ""3-Way"" sign at the beginning of my second; whatever was waiting on Eddie Lee's secret path, I didn't want to meet it already out of breath. Crossing Fourth, I broke into a fresh run. A woman turned off Fourth and streaked past me&mdash;from her hair and build, the same one I'd seen disappear Monday. A hundred feet ahead of me, she again simply sank into the pavement, arms pumping, black ponytail flipping. I'd imagined a magic subway entrance appearing, or a hole I had to leap into. I'd pictured running through brick tunnels connecting forgotten basements under downtown Argenta. I passed the ""3-Way"" sign, thumped past a used-clothing store, and the buildings disappeared. **** One step I was on JFK, surrounded by storefronts and cars; my next step landed on packed dirt, a gorge's rocky walls rising not much more than arm's length to either side. The gorge was only about ten feet deep, but it slanted down sharply toward a dark hole. I almost pulled up. *Don't stop.* After a couple of broken strides, I settled into my downhill pace and ran at the opening. *Was I supposed to bring a headlamp?* I had time to wonder, then I saw light beyond the opening. I dove into the ground, the passage's roof only a couple of feet above my head. A few steps in, my Garmin beeped ""Lost Satellites"". I ran in a rough cave, a path of wet stone and hard mud. Indirectly lit, yellowish glows from hidden sources, like the caverns I visited as a kid. The passage curved, rising and falling, narrowing to the size of my front hall then widening like a one-car garage. The path was rough and uneven, but that didn't bother me. I'd run track and field in high school, and have an excellent eye for distance, judging where my feet will fall several paces in advance. On days when I can't get into the zen of running, I'll play at avoiding sidewalk cracks; at a dead run that means reading at least half a dozen strides ahead. I passed a bench. I could stop safely, but that would be cheating; I was just starting. Branch passages appeared. I followed yellow paint markings, done with a heavy brush, not sprayed on; others were red, green, and blue. A few branches were marked with orange *X*s. Some markings were faded; some looked fairly fresh. The cave was cool, but warmer than the winter evening I'd left behind. I unzipped my jacket and boosted my pace slightly. The air was less dry than the winter breeze outside, easier on my sinuses and throat. Though I've seen more scenic caves, this made a pleasant setting for my run. But what was so dangerous? At the thought, I passed through a narrow point&mdash;and the right wall disappeared. I was running a ledge above a chasm; light faded about twenty feet down, and I couldn't judge its depth. I began to pass occasional flowstone or stalagmites. The path was barely wide enough for one person to pass another. My foot slipped on a muddy spot, and my heart jumped; if I slipped here I was a goner. But why couldn't I just slow down until I passed this stretch? *Keep running, no matter what.* Swerving around a bulge of flowstone, my foot slipped right at the edge. Gasping, I waved my arms for balance. Reaching a wider stretch, I glanced back at where I'd nearly fallen. Something was behind me. **** When I was a kid, I saw a TV movie called *The Borrowers*, from Mary Norton's classic book about six-inch-tall people living under the floors of an old house. The first part mostly bored me. But the ending, where a trained ferret is turned loose to pursue the Borrowers under the floors, scared the living Jesus out of me. For weeks I had nightmares about that giant, slithery creature chasing the little family; I've hated ferrets ever since, the vicious little bastards. That's what followed in the dim yellow light: a giant ferret, twelve or fifteen feet long, sliding along the ledge. Yellow teeth gleamed in its barely-parted mouth. Its claws, tiny for its size, were longer than my fingers. I bolted. Heedless of the crevice, I ran pell-mell down the ledge, slipping and stumbling in panic. I threw glances back when I could; the ferret was about a hundred feet behind me, clinging to the narrow ledge, winding past stalactites. I nearly missed the yellow-blazed side passage. Trying to enter at a dead run, I crashed into the wall, staggered, then started away from the crevice. I'd lost a lot of time on the turn; I could almost feel those teeth closing on my shoulder, tearing into my throat. Looking back, I saw the ferret squeezing into the narrow tunnel, still about a hundred feet back. It hadn't gained at all. *You're safe as long as you don't panic.* Was *this* what he'd meant? *Easy for you to say, Goddammit, Ed!* But I couldn't keep up this pace for long. Struggling with my fear, I tried to find a more sustainable pace. *Breathe. Set your stride. Watch the ground!* I pounded down the passage, burst into a large open chamber, high-vaulted, brightly lit, dotted with stalagmites through which the beaten track wove. Jaw tense, knowing this open space was all to the ferret's advantage, I set my pace, then glanced back. The ferret was still about a hundred feet away. My Garmin announce the start of a slow interval. ""Crap on that,"" I gasped. *How long can you run?* It looked like I was going to find out. **** Halfway across the huge cavern, I saw the ponytailed runner come out of another passage. She ran with fierce concentration along a path that intersected mine. And behind her ran a creature made of bone knives. That was my first thought: Bony blades protruded at elbows, shoulders, heels, along its spine, even from its ears. It paced her exactly. She turned, running directly up the path toward me. The tunnel she'd emerged from was blazed in red; glancing back, I saw another red blaze beyond the ferret. She'd have to pass it&mdash;and I'd have to pass her knife-demon. She never hesitated; I didn't dare either. We danced past each other on the narrow path, and I charged headlong at the knife creature. It never even glanced at me. I spotted a yellow-blazed exit, and turned toward it. I dove into a dim crevice, narrow but very tall. The ferret followed easily. How long had I been running? I glanced at my Garmin, but I didn't know when I'd entered the tunnels. Seven, eight minutes? *How long can you run?* My lungs burned, my legs ached. Another cavern, another passage, and suddenly I ran along a knife edge, black void to either side. I didn't dare glance back; every ounce of concentration went to placing my next step, and the one after. Then there was a broken downward slope, broad uneven steps slick with seepage. I heard a clatter behind me, and turned to see the ferret scrambling to its feet; even it found the going treacherous. Another cavern, then a blessedly dry passage that turned to a steep climb, almost a staircase. I realized thirty feet up that I'd passed a bench in the cavern without stopping. Had inattention doomed me? It seems odd, now, that I never doubted two things: As long as I kept running, the ferret would do no more than pace me; but if I slowed to less than my best sustainable pace, I was dead. This secret path made you run your best, however slow it was&mdash;the penalty was for weakness of spirit, not of flesh. I pounded on. A glimpse of my Garmin: another six minutes gone. I forced myself to think confidently: I had this under control. No giant ferret was going to break me. Bad mistake. **** I caught a flicker at the edge of my vision. I glanced sideways but saw nothing. Another flicker, the other side. Had the ferret closed the gap? I threw a look right back; my giant pursuer was gone. Then I saw something like a flowing carpet, on the path behind me, and weaving through the stalagmites to either side. The huge ferret had vanished, but dozens of others, the size of Siamese cats, had replaced it. I thought I had the cave licked, then the rules changed. In a burst of fresh panic, I surged forward. The rational part of my mind said I'd burn out at this pace, but I couldn't slow down. God, was there ever going to be another bench? My Garmin beeped some useless warning. I let out a bitter laugh&mdash;and the worst of my panic broke. I was still scared&mdash;strike that: I was *terrified*, but I could deal with the fear. I couldn't afford to get confident, though; I understood now that the cave could keep adjusting to new ways of scaring me. I'd been holding a fast pace at least twenty minutes. I knew I couldn't do this much longer. How long was the yellow-blazed path? I burst out into another cavern, and there, blessedly, was a bench, black-painted wrought iron. At sight of sanctuary, all the air seemed to evaporate from my lungs. I staggered forward and collapsed onto it, gasping. Eddie Lee's medallion clanked off one metal arm. Glancing all around, I expected to see the ferrets stalking the cavern's sides, watching. But they were gone. The Garmin beeped again, so I silenced it. It showed my step count, but without GPS it couldn't map my route. I sucked down some water, grateful for the cavern's moist air. I'd never run such a long unbroken interval. **** This cavern was much smaller, with only four passages, one of which was X'd off. The other three had a mix of blaze colors. I saw yellow among the blazes on the largest passage, and on the narrow cleft through which I'd entered. The yellow path was blazed in both directions&mdash;was I going to have to run it backward to get out? I heard pounding feet. A few moments later, the black-haired runner emerged from the last passage, blazed red and green. She saw me panting heavily; though running easily, she pulled up in front of the bench. ""Y'mind?"" she asked, then plumped companionably beside me, not waiting for an answer. She was older than I'd judged, near to my age. Despite the cave's coolness she smelled pleasantly of healthy sweat. ""You're new down here, ain't'cha?"" she asked, barely breathing fast. I was still fighting for oxygen. ""First time through,"" I huffed. ""Following yellow."" ""Good start. I'm Merry, like in Christmas."" ""I'm Knox. You know Eddie Lee?"" ""Sure,"" she replied. ""Is that his medal?"" I realized she didn't wear a medallion. She saw my glance at her chest, and fortunately interpreted it correctly. ""You only need it the first few times,"" she said, ""till you learn the entrances."" ""How many are there?"" ""Six, I think. I'm not sure. There're four trails; I guess you've seen that."" ""Is red the hardest?"" She laughed. ""Not by a long shot. They go yellow, blue, red, green. I don't think even Eddie Lee's run the green more than once or twice. I've never gotten up the nerve."" ""But you aren't even out of breath!"" ""I just got off a bench a minute ago. I saw you, stopped to say hi. They're spaced kinda weird. Nobody knows why."" ""Nobody&mdash; I thought Eddie Lee set this up? Who blazed the paths?"" ""I got no idea. But it's the greatest place to run, ever. You finish a run down here, you know you're alive&mdash;and you've earned it."" ""Don't the thrill kinda wear off once you learn the rules down here?"" ""Rules?"" She laughed. ""There ain't but two rules. *Don't give up.* And, *Don't talk on the trail.*"" She patted my knee familiarly. ""If you think you've found any other rules, forget 'em&mdash;they'll get you killed."" She rose and stretched enticingly&mdash;but I'd already noted her stylish silicone wedding band. ""See you!"" she said, and took off. **** I'd caught my breath by now, so I downed a Luna bar and some Nilla wafers, took another drink, then pushed to my feet. With a glance around for ferrets big or small, I took the larger yellow-blazed exit. I tried to run as Merry had, always forward, never looking back. But I couldn't help glancing over my shoulders. I saw no ferrets&mdash;but they'd only appeared when I thought of slowing down. The cave's variety seemed unending. I passed through twisting passages lined with flowstone, tall crevices, sequences of small caverns; up or down, wet or dry, narrow or wide. The only constant was headroom; I could always run upright. Within a quarter mile I realized I'd set too fast a pace. My personal-best run interval had been costly, nearly emptying my reserves. If I tried to run a similar interval this time, I'd pass out. At the thought, I found myself listening for claws. I listened so hard it was another quarter mile before I noticed the smoke. A faint haze clouded the hidden yellow lights. An unpleasant odor, with a nasty tang of sulfur and burnt plastics, stung my nostrils. Giving in, I glanced back: Dark smoke billowed in the passage behind me. Passing a crevice, I saw a red glow far below, fresh smoke swirling toward me. I felt a burst of heat in the cave's coolness. ""That's not *fair,*"" I huffed. If the ferrets got close, they'd spur me to greater speed, but if smoke surrounded me, I'd start coughing and lose my wind. And the smoke dimmed the light&mdash;what if that meant I failed to see a bench or a blaze? Panic began to creep back in. On a normal run I could focus into a sort of runner's zen, but not on an unfamiliar and dangerous path, desperately alert for the next bench. In the 1980s there'd been a fire at the motor plant where my dad worked; acrid smoke had blanketed the town for a day and a half, and Dad had coughed for a month. Now I didn't bother wondering what in a stone cave could be burning; I just ran from it. **** I might have lost control if I hadn't heard another runner, footsteps approaching slowly from behind. Trying to distinguish rubber soles from ferret pads, I caught the unevenness of the steps. Glancing back, I saw a face more panicked than mine, a younger man at the edge of exhaustion. He staggered down the track, sweat-soaked despite the cool draft, arms flailing like a swimmer drowning in air. Smoke swirled around him but not in his path; fire wasn't his current fear. Something sailed in the air behind him, but I couldn't make it out. He thudded closer. The passage narrowed until I was nearly banging my elbows, and I heard his cry of despair when he realized he couldn't pass. But it was only a few paces before the walls fell back and we entered a long wide climb, smoke-wreathed stalactites far overhead. He pushed up to my elbow, panting frantically. He didn't glance at me, only another obstacle to be passed. Spit ran down his chin. His white-rimmed eyes stared ahead like a frightened sheep. In black tights and a snug long-sleeve red tee, he was slab-shouldered and slim-waisted, obviously in good condition, but just as obviously at the end of his endurance. Where I'd be in minutes if I let panic take me. Then I made a terrible mistake. I was going to say, ""Don't give up; you're safe if you don't stop."" But I got no further than ""Don't give&mdash;"" when a swirl of thick smoke rammed itself down my throat, choking me. *Don't talk on the trail,* Merry'd said. Coughing violently, I doubled over, still running. Inevitably I stumbled, whanging my knee onto mud-slick stone. *Not fair!* I wailed inside, as I rolled over one shoulder, feeling flames lick my arm. Terrified, I kept rolling until I could push to my feet and stagger onward. The other man had gained several yards, and for the first time I could see what pursued him. I was surprised into a laugh that turned to more coughing. Half a dozen paper plates patterned in party colors, pink and yellow and sky blue, flew behind him. Just the size for a slice of birthday cake, they swooped and darted around each other like strange round birds. They looked comical, but to him they must have represented a deadly threat. What weird childhood trauma made party plates fearful to him? Or did he associate them with a child of his, some tragedy of fatherhood? What turned those cheery conveyors of cake and ice cream to instruments of terror? If we reached the next bench, maybe I'd ask. **** My knee was killing me; my throat burned from smoke; but I ran on doggedly. The slight limp slowed me. But the smoke and heat punished me no further, and the new pace was more sustainable&mdash;if my knee held out. Even slowed, now I gained on the younger man, his steps more stumbling, his breathing more ragged. I didn't think he had more than twenty yards left. I trailed him by about fifteen feet. A plate zipped forward. He shrieked and clapped a hand to his cheek. From somewhere he found a new burst of strength; his feet steadied and his speed increased. The soaring plates fell back. Edging closer, I saw blood streaking his face from a slash across his cheekbone. Droplets spattered the muddy path. His arms pumped across his chest, fists clenched. *Hold on,* I urged mentally. Ahead I heard pattering water, echoes suggesting a cavern. *There'll be a bench there,* I prayed. Why hadn't I thought to ask Merry how long the yellow path was? My uninjured leg suddenly cramped, my calf knotting. Unable to straighten the leg, barely controlling my foot, I hobbled on, the other runner pulling away once more. By willpower and sheer terror I forced the leg to straighten and bend. But I was several seconds behind him entering the cavern, surrounded by hot smoke, eyes watering and lungs searing. I was twenty feet in before I could see across. A trickle of water fell from the ceiling, pattering into a small pool. Passages opened on all sides. There was no bench. **** Despite his lead, he was slower to see. But all at once he gave a sob, threw up his arms, and stopped, chest heaving. The paper plates attacked. One dove at his legs, slicing the outside of his thigh, blood starting under his gashed tights. Another swiped across his lower back, parting his tee, also drawing blood. But neither cut much more than skin-deep&mdash;warning shots, really. He cried out, swatting feebly at the one passing his leg, but made no effort to run. Instead he collapsed, sobbing, almost in the little pool. All the plates struck him at once. He tried to curl up to cover himself, but his overused legs kicked and spasmed; he rolled onto his back and wrapped his arms over his face. I saw a medallion fall beside his shoulder, an oval on a light chain&mdash;like me, he was a newcomer. Several plates attacked his belly and groin; he instinctively batted them away with both hands. And the last party plate dove like the blade of an axe into his exposed throat. That plate may have saved my life. Four strides away, I'd been about to stop, ignoring my own danger, to try to get him on his feet. The smoke had thickened around me, reading my thoughts. But when I saw that plate chop through his windpipe, when blood gushed directly across my path, I knew he was beyond my aid. I thumped past, seeing the pool flushing with red, feeling hot blood spray across my bare calf. Halfway across the cavern, wrapped in smoke, intent on the young man, I at last thought to look for my exit. Through the smoke I spotted a pale mark and headed toward it. Though my strength was still fading, my knee was improving, bruised but not injured, and the cramp was working out. I held to the slower pace the knee had caused, and the smoke kept away; I could keep going, hopefully for several more minutes. So when I realized the passage I was entering was topped not by a yellow slash but by a faded orange *X*, I nearly fainted. **** I flinched when I saw the mark clearly, the way your foot twitches toward the brake when a kid on a bike shoots out of a driveway, but I never came close to stopping or turning aside. I knew the smoke would get me. I could only hope the passage wasn't a dead end. I was determined to keep going past any other obstacles. The passage climbed steeply, bending left and right, becoming dry again. I had to slow, conserving my strength. Not long before the path leveled out, a crevice appeared on my left, so that once again I ran along a ledge, here about five feet wide. The lighting was weaker; I still had no idea how it worked, with neither wiring nor fixtures visible. A short way ahead, it seemed to fail completely for a stretch. Then I realized the truth: The ledge itself failed, a section about eight feet long missing. In high school I'd routinely long-jumped over twenty feet, with my best being 21'5"". I'd *standing*-jumped distances comparable to this gap. But I was forty pounds heavier now, out of shape and practice, and all but foundered. I'd usually used a twenty-step approach; I had only eight or nine here. My eye, though, was as good as ever. Over the next three strides I mapped my abbreviated approach. Four full strides, accelerating steadily; a shortened stride to plant my right foot flat at the very edge for takeoff. But my leg had no spring left. Instead of launching upward, I tumbled forward, out of control. Heels over head, I had time to register that this crevice lacked the fire glow I'd seen earlier, then I crashed butt-first into a wet stone wall. I slid down rather than falling, but I still hit the bottom hard. In moments smoke swirled around me; with my feet silenced I heard the crackle and roar of distant flames. **** For a heartbeat or two I was sure I was dead. Then my feet found rock, and I pushed myself up, sore and stunned but still moving. Only the faintest glimmer of light reached down here, but I could see there was no path. To escape, I had to climb. ""Up!"" I snapped at myself. ""Move! *Cough-cough!* Don't give up!"" Without more than a glance toward the ledge, I grabbed an outcropping and began to pull myself up. The rock was wet with seepage, but very rough; I had no trouble finding hand- or footholds. But my legs barely had strength to lift; my arms did more than their share of the work. I made it; I'm not sure how. At the top I clambered onto the path, and ran. Smoke hazed the air, and exhaustion hazed my vision, but I lumbered on. Nausea attacked me, and I vomited to one side without stopping. I slipped into another small cavern. With a near-level floor and a few stalagmites, it looked like two or three others I'd already run through, and I realized I didn't know where I was. Which yellow blaze should I follow&mdash;or was there one? I spotted one ahead, and looked back to see another near the orange-*X*'d slit where I'd emerged. My heart jumped when I saw that passage was marked with all four colors. Without hesitation I turned directly toward it, defying the smoke. I'd judged that the confluence of all four tracks meant an exit was near. A hundred paces up the tunnel I came to another bench, and learned I was correct: On the wall opposite was painted a large white arrow and the word ""OUT"". **** I collapsed to the bench, bruised and dizzy and nauseous, ribs and knees aching. When I stood to unzip my belt pack, my vision went dark and I sat down abruptly, whacking my elbow on the iron arm. I don't know how long I sat there, sipping water, afraid to swallow my squashed energy bar or smashed-up cookies. Amazingly, I seemed, overall, uninjured: The hair on my arm was crumbly from flames and my knee was still sore to the touch from my first fall, but my well-padded seat had taken the worst of my attempted long jump. Emotionally, though, I felt steamrollered, gutshot. I'd never in my life been so frightened for so long. I heard running feet and looked up, wishing to see the young man safely escaped. But it was ponytailed Merry. ""You made it!"" she cried happily. I glanced down at the blood drying black on my leg. ""*I* did. Some other guy didn't."" ""Oh, no!"" She slumped to the bench, looking ill. ""The young guy in the Death Cab for Cutie shirt?"" ""I don't know; it was red."" I told her briefly what had happened; it was shockingly hard to suppress a giggle as I spoke of the murderous paper plates. We sat shoulder to shoulder for a while, drawing comfort from each other. At last I glanced at my watch. With my extended rests, I'd left the office more than an hour and a half earlier; I'd run miles, with no idea of direction. Well, if I came out halfway across town from my car, I'd deal with it. I didn't even try to run to the exit. Merry walked along with me. We emerged into a rock-walled draw in full night. When the buildings reappeared, we were still downtown&mdash;just a few blocks, in fact, from where we'd gone in. The breeze was cold off Pine Ridge; we'd have a heavy frost in the morning. **** She shuddered as Argenta sprang up around us. Surprised, I looked over; her face was drawn, more fearful than when the bone creature had pursued her. ""Are you all right?"" She shook her head. ""It was never real before. I believed I *could* die&mdash;but I always won, so it wasn't real. But somebody actually was killed this time, while I was down there having fun being scared."" Huddling into herself, she said, ""I don't think I can go back down there. Can you?"" I was exhausted, sore, emotionally drained. I'd seen a man killed. I'd run for my life from some of my worst fears&mdash;and knew the caves could find others. I'd pushed myself beyond what I'd thought possible. Looking at her again, I realized it wasn't just fear I saw&mdash;it was shame, as well. ""There's a half marathon in Bentonville in April,"" I said. ""I've never run that far before. But I'm going to do it this year."" Suppressing a groan, I teetered on one leg while I raised the other to knock off the worst of the dried blood. My nonchalance was utterly fake, and we both knew it&mdash;and somehow that made it real. ""We're both alive,"" I continued, ""and just like you said: *We've earned it.*"" She was losing the shamed look: survivor's guilt, not shame at her fear. I forced my aching limbs into a huge stretch. ""Damn straight I'm going down there again. Not every day, maybe not every week, but *soon*&mdash;every time I need to be alive. And so are you, *and you know it.*"" She tapped Eddie Lee's medallion on my chest. ""Yeah, I guess I am."" All serious runners are a little nuts.

798,"Off My Chest: Suicide ""Prevention"" GMTI need to get this off my chest, and with things seemingly getting worse I kind of hope this reaches the right people. &#x200B; I'm guessing that GMTs from Command to Command differ based off who is giving them. The suicide prevention training at mine would be more accurately described as ""Suicide Awareness and Empathy"". Yes we need to be more empathetic as a Navy. We need to recognize this as a serious mental health problem. Yes you can go to Mental Health and keep your job. But really that training was alarmingly lacking in a time where it feels like Sailors left and right are dropping like flies. &#x200B; [Means Matter](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/) if you haven't heard of this campaign, the Navy had it linked on bupers. Nothing from this was brought up at my GMT. Here's some ""fun"" statements to think about. * Many suicide attempts occur with little planning during a short-term crisis * When asked of survivors of suicide attempts: 24% said less than 25 minutes, 47% said within 1 hour or less. * 52% of suicides in 2004 were with a firearm The argument of that campaign is education on how people suicide and to reduce access to means when a person has been identified as being at risk. &#x200B; >""You always have to speak to a crowd as if you are speaking to the dumbest person in the room"". > >What I mean is; don't just assume everyone there knows why you are saying a particular thing. The GMT says, if someone is suicidal ""stay with them until you can get them to professional help"" but WHY. Why do you stay with them? - Obviously so they don't kill themselves, right? So does that mean hunker up at their place until they're ready to get help? Sleep on their couch so they know someone is there if they need it? Not everyone understands what the intent is when you tell them vaguely ""stay with them"". **Personal Story**: My brother died by suicide. Four of my family members were there. They were in crisis alert. They knew they needed to stay with him and talk him down. At first he argued with them, then he asked to use the restroom. They did a sweep of the bathroom removing any medication or other means he could harm himself with. He was fine, the night dragged on and eventually he said he was tired and just wanted to sleep. They felt relief thinking that if he could sleep off the alcohol he would feel better in the morning they told him they would stay the night there. They let their guard down and didn't sweep his bedroom. Within 6 seconds of closing his bedroom door they heard the gunshot. They didn't know he owned a gun. My point is, in this situation they ""knew"" to stay with him. But they didn't necessarily understand why. They thought they could get him professional help in the morning. They were afraid that getting the cops involved would escalate the situation and were focused on calming him down. This GMT needs to include first response training. You don't get to cherry pick who will be the first responder to a suicidal sailor. This is life saving information we can't just hoard and only give to people who sign up for specialized classes. We all need the tools to recognize when someone is a crisis and respond appropriately. * They don't leave your fucking sight. Congrats you're on Urinalysis. * They may be combative, they may even tell you that they're feeling better now. It doesn't matter. It is now your responsibility to get these guys straight to professionals. If you have to call 911 to get their ass in the ER for observation you fucking do it. I rather someone hate me for the rest of their life, than for them to end their life too soon. Obviously its difficult to assess between crisis and ideation. We're not in their heads. We're not professionals. There are times when getting them to therapy doesn't have to happen right that second. But there are times when it is. None of this was mentioned and it broke my heart. This kind of knowledge could save your friend's life, your spouse, even your child. Its not really just about sailors. &#x200B; * Know your buddy is going through some tough shit, offer to store their weapons. Ask them to store them in the armory. * Know your buddy isn't doing too hot with some tough shit, don't offer to get them wasted. Guess what doesn't mix well with suicidal ideation? Yup- Alcohol More ""fun"" stats. In 2017 for the age groups 10-14, 15-24, 25-34, it is the second leading cause of death. In 34-44 and 45-54 it is the 4th. That is with both genders combined. Suicide affects men and women differently. For men it remains the number 2 leading cause of death (in 2015) from the ages 10-39 and for females 15-29. [Source](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/LCWK1_2015.pdf) Why do I think this is worth mentioning? Because if you're going through this, you are not alone, you are not abnormal. This is an epidemic. You shouldn't be ashamed or embarrassed. This is the world we live in and we don't know why yet. But reach out and get some help. And don't be discouraged if it takes a few tries and its difficult to get to the right people. Treat it like you would a broken foot, you don't have to deal with it alone and you certainly don't have to walk on it without help. If you are going through something, don't be afraid to store your firearms at the armory. Ask a friend to hold on to them and let them know you're not in the best place right now and you want to be safe. Don't drink to self medicate. There is a strong correlation between alcohol and suicide. Basically this is what I wanted to get off my chest, I know its a personal matter to me and I get that I might not be seeing too clearly on the subject. Just look out for others, this could be happening to someone close to you. The GMT wasn't bad. But I felt like it was really missing something for the ""prevention"" part. If you made it this far, thanks for reading and spread the word.",
799,"[Unscripted Rant]: Is there a canon to AN? I like to have faith in some crazy things which many nice people won't like.There are so many overlapping subs I am getting a little dizzy! I can say since I was a child I never really enjoyed it. My parents were garden-variety half decent but bouts of poverty fucked us over. Giving the devil his due, my parents did work hard(ish) to educate me. My mother use to really hit me a lot. Until when I grew up I once had to take a knife with full honest intention of sticking it in her heart and a few years later nearly shattering her jaw. I literally had to hit that women to get her to stop perpetually abusing me. What a cunt! But then all parents are arent they. I once asked her ""why did you have my sister and me"" and after hours of me poking her she said ""because everyone has children"". To be honest before reliable birth control this would have been a valid answer. &#x200B; Anyways this is how I try to align my beliefs: Unless we can somehow (I do not know how exactly) achieve guaranteed end of suffering (biologically) and have Real (as real as it gets) Post Scarcity - this world and the universe is not fit for sentient and sapient life. The Hedonistic Imperative: [https://www.hedweb.com/](https://www.hedweb.com/) Post Scarcity Conditions: { 1. Figure out a way to mate matter and assimilate matter via energy 2. Figure out Nuclear Fusion and other ways of harnessing almost abundant energy with minuscule plentiful raw material (say sea water) 3. Figure out cheap Desalination 4. Figure out genuine AGI and ASI } I personally want to remain childfree for selfish and misanthropic reasons. No I am not a fan of suffering. But I would only rejoice a birth if we achieve what I descried above. I support universal Rational Suicide law. Its just cruel to keep people in this prison. Its also cruel to make them suffer. I am also inclined so simultaneous support real organisations (if such do exists) to engineer a virus to end all senescence on the planet, swiftly, and painlessly.

800,"Friend of a Suicidal friend looking for advice...Hello /r/SuicideWatch , I come to you bearing some news that may not be unfamiliar to you all, but nonetheless still saddening. I have been friends with this girl for 4 years now, me and her even had a short dating history. It has been roughly 2 years since our break up and we have been decent friends since then. Enough about us. I came here Tonight to ask for help. About 2 years ago her parents divorced because her mother was cheating on her father. This is when she started having massive Anxiety attacks. Six months after we broke up she got a new boyfriends things were going great for them. Then suddenly he starts being a complete ass to her and cheats on her. This made her tip over the edge for a month or two. She quickly got another boyfriend. Here is the Catch though. The boyfriend is her mothers boyfriend's son. They were going good for about 3 months, then she was told she was not allowed to go to college because of her mom failing to submit the financial aid papers. This just added onto her issues. Fast forward to the last two to three weeks. She is now in college, but failing all of her classes. Her boyfriend is distancing herself from him, partially because her mother broke up with his father. Here is the kicker... Her mother is blaming her for the break up, saying it is her fault. She has said things ""You need to cheer up you are such a downer"", ""get a grip"", ""you need to be happy"". Plus her sister is completely out of hand ( I would be here all night trying to explain what is wrong with her). Just last week we found out her mother is seeing another guy (The mother hadn't broken up with the boyfriend at this time). To top it all off my friend now has Anxiety, an Attachment Disorder (Anxiety from having no familiar around), and I say she is depressed. She is scared to tell her Therapist that she is suicidal because she will get kicked out of school and won't be able to return. She has told me multiple times in the last week that she wants to kill herself, but doesn't want that in-between life and death (so pills out of the question i hope..)., She said she has contemplated not drinking water, not eating, Carbon monoxide poisoning... She constantly says no one cares, which isn't true me and three of her close friends constantly tell her that we care...which doesn't since the three people she wants to care(mom, and boyfriend, dad) don't seem to give a rats ass about her. She constantly says that each day the part that is scared to commit suicide shrinks..which scares me a lot.... Also, she constantly says no one will miss her when she is gone. I tell her i do, but she then replies ""You only will for a few weeks"". So what i came here for was some advice, for what I could do when talking to her... I really want to call her Mother and yell at her... she knows her daughter is suicidal... but doesn't seem to care... I care about her so much, I have tried giving her advice from when I was suicidal....(I had a good network of people around me though), but she rejects them...I can't seem to get through to her... P.S. I am sorry for the poor Grammar and spelling it is currently 12:30 AM where I live and I'm very tired...I probably won't be able to reply till morning because i feel I am about to pass out. It feels nice to get some of this off my chest... Tl;DR: Friend has a pretty hard life, is suicidal, and I need advice...",
801,"Acted on a 30 second suicidal impulse. I know this is long. I don't expect anyone to read it; just had to tell someone. **(TRIGGER WARNING)**This isn't a throwaway account. When I joined reddit, I decided to ""let it all hang out"". Still, I am carrying around so much guilt and shame;this happened in early July of this year. I almost posted this to /r/offmychest, but I thought that it would be more appropriate here. I had a couple of attempts in my early 20's, but I didn't really want to die. I just needed help, and no one would listen to me. This time was nothing like that. This time, my child, who is in her 20s, told me that she had come to the decision that she was done. She had tried so hard but now she was done. And she was not waking up in the morning. Nothing I could say or do helped. She took my hands in hers and said goodbye, and then she walked out the door. I knew then that I would never see her again (in this life). I am not religious in any way, but I am spiritual, and I do believe that we go on, in some form, after death. So about an hour after she left, I decided that I had to be there (in the hereafter) to sort of ""catch"" my baby when she came through. I had this impulse for about 30 seconds before I grabbed the razor blade. I don't remember cutting, nor do I remember any blood. In fact, I remember very little about the next 36 hours. I was partially catatonic, or so I was told. I severed the artery twice, cut tendons, nerves, etc. 172 stitches; staph infection, the whole nine. My daughter sought emergency help, and she is much better now. This is a sacred thing to me, because I can't live without my girls. So I want to thank all that is holy. The thing is, *I'm not suicidal!* I wasn't before, and as soon as I was lucid and in control of my faculties, I haven't been since. Why did I do this?! And *how* could I have hurt everyone who loves me so much? Does anyone out there understand? Has anyone else had a similar experience?

I don't want to track her or search through her things, I feel like it will make her lose trust in me. I want to talk to her about it, but she just locks herself in her room all day and doesn't speak to me unless she's asking me for food. I keep pills and knives locked away, but I'm scared that one day she won't come home from school, or won't be there when I wake her up in the morning. I don't know what to do, because I don't want to invade her privacy, but I don't want her to commit suicide and have to live with the thought that not only is my daughter dead, but she told countless online friends about it and not me, and that I was in the same room as what she used to plan. We've tried to put her through therapy before, but she just won't open up and doesn't want to go. She doesn't trust me or her father, and she's our only child. I'm worried about her. Help? Edit: Thank you. I'll be trying again to take her to therapy and taking her to a doctor.",
803,"My Daughter is Suicidal, please helpMy daughter is 12. She just started 7th grade. Last year, about a month after 6th grade, she tried to kill herself by taking pills. Luckily, they weren't very dangerous ones, and they made her sick. She tearfully confessed to me what she had done. We immediately took her to the ER. Fortunately, the pill dosage itself did not require treatment. We all talked to a social worker, both separately and together (me, my daughter, and my husband). She also talked to a psychiatrist. She was upset about a class / teacher. After talking to her, they decided that she would be best not committed to an in-patient facility and let her come home with instructions to us to get her counselling. We did, right away. We also immediately got her out of that class, which seemed to be a big weight off her shoulders. She liked the counselor, and so did we. After a few months, the counselor thought she was doing well and could discontinue. Well, school just started 2 days ago. She hasn't seemed like her happy self. When I try to talk to her about it, she says everything's fine, that's she's just tired (which is probably true). But it just wasn't feeling right to me. So today, I looked through her room. She doesn't really keep a diary, but I found a notebook where she wrote that she was really worried about 7th grade and that if she died in 7th grade, it would be by suicide. She wrote it a few days before school started. Obviously, I'm horribly upset. Of course, I'm scheduling more counselling for her. But my concern is that she doesn't open up to counselors. Her last one even said that she didn't really talk much. How can we help her is she won't open up? If it matters, we have an intact family. We live a pretty comfortable life. Nice neighborhood. She's lived in this house her whole life, so no moves or anything. She has an older sister who she gets along really well with. My husband and I get along great. Things at home are pretty good. And I think she would agree with that. How do I help her?",
804,"My neighbors daughter is suicidal and they won't help her. I want to, but I don't know how. Help?Exactly what the title says. My neighbors are on the older side and they daughter is somewhere around 25. My parents and I have talked to them a handful of times and from what we've gathered their daughter has... • done several years of drugs • likely some mental issues • cuts • depressed • is shooting herself in the legs and arms with a BB gun and has threatened suicide a number of times We know that the parents themselves have mental issues which might be why they don't get the girl help? I don't know, but I do know that this girl is suicidal and I want to do something but I don't know how. Is there a number I can call to let people know that this girl needs help?",
805,"My daughter is suicidal. I desperately need support and advice. (She’s in a hospital right now)My 15 yr old daughter got admitted to a psych unit again tonight. 4th time since April. This time was the scariest. Everything has been going so well, truly. I came home today and she just said Mom I’m suicidal. We talked calmly and she said she’d made plans and wanted to die. Very cold, apathetic and with a lot of rage in her eyes. I texted her therapist, we zipped over so they could talk and make a safety plan. That was not possible so we went to the hospital. She told me things I’ve never known before. Apparently she’s experimented with types of self harm and suicidal behaviors for YEARS. She said since 10 but maybe younger. She said as an even younger child she wrote suicide notes over and over and would just hide them or throw them away. She said she’s always wanted to die and she still does. Even when times are good. She told me she tried to buy a gun before, and she’s thought of multiple other plans including ingesting poisonous household liquid, and drowning herself or throwing herself in front of a car. This is a child who has always been so full of life and hope and happiness. NO ONE would EVER think that SHE would EVERRRR feel this way. So much secret pain. I felt deep shame before and now I feel guilt for having brought her into this fucked up world. She’s in so much pain and she doesn’t even know why. And her mental genetics are AWFUL. Her dad (who she’s never met, and isn’t even on the birth certificate) was a 23 yr old homicidal sociopath who impregnated me at 15. She has always been the light of my life and we’ve grown up together. We love each other so so so much and I just don’t know what we’d do without each other. But how do I keep someone like this alive? She’s done inpatient 4 times, completed PHP, almost done with IOP. In private therapy twice a week. I meet with her therapist once a week. And now, her therapist is recommending residential. I’m in shock, I’m terrified, and I am in so much pain for her and myself and the world if we were to lose her. She’s a special one. Y’all please keep us in your prayers and dreams and hopes. Any advice is welcome. If any of you have experienced feeling this way yourself please share too. I just need something, anything. Thx P.S. she’s been dx bipolar 2 but probably other stuff is going on as well we’re still trying to figure out.",

I have never met her mother but I have her phone number. I just want to let her mom know before anything really bad happens to her.

809,"My unemployed daughter is SUICIDAL, losing her virginity and job. No one wants her.I'm a father. Here its so hard to find a job, and the thought of having sex before securing a financially stable job is NOT on any niceguys' mind out of respect. To be considerate and a niceguy, and to not take a womans' virginity. That was who I was. Thinking back, considering all the depression I've been through and the fact I'm a man with much stronger mentality and resilience... I can't even imagine any girl in their right mind would be happy moaning wanting to get fucked hard squirting and all that shit to only end up unemployed. It must be so humiliating for these women who have been used pumped and dumped thinking they can beat men in this game. I've been to many job interviews and I was humiliated for having an ugly boy face and being short I was mocked and humiliated big time. I remember walking into the CBD, inside the high rise skyscrapers and I see all those attractive tall elegant ladies just laugh at me. Then again I see the other side of the town, ridden with obesity, mental illness, depression complete ghetto. Good men are men who are considerate, look out for women and take care of them. Freeloader women who get laid, get pregnant, and have no self respect.. Man.. Just the degeneracy overall. I just feel sorry for the mental health of these women. It just grosses me out. My unemployed daughter is SUICIDAL, losing her virginity and job. No one wants her because other men think she has been used up many times. I've had countless arguments with her and she still doesn't listen. I told her men value a woman's virginity. Now she has nothing to offer other men. She IS SO ENTITLED AND LAZY.

810,[TOMT] [movie] It was a dramatic film in which a daughter is suicidal or has decided to commit suicide and there is a scene where her mother is talking about something insignificant obliviouslyI can't remember much else but it wasn't too recent and it was a very serious film,
813,"Mother makes her daughter suicidal because daughter is sick of being a parent to her sistersSo I've known this Karen (obv not her real name) my whole life. She's the type of person that complains about maxing out her credit cards and 3 days later books a holiday. She is also always bragging about how perfect her children are, even though her eldist raised them almost by herself. People involved in this are Karen (em), her oldest daughter (d), Karen's brother (u) and her daughter's boyfriend (bf). From the age of about 6, em made d look after her little sisters because em was always too busy with charity work. Me and all of the other friends d had, have always told her that she shouldn't put up with it but she knew that if she didn't cook for her sisters, they'd eat cereal for dinner. I also suspect that she didn't think she deserved a social life because she'd been raised just to be a free babysitter (even when em was home). She got her bf about 4 months before things started kicking off. D started to stand up for herself. She didn't want to have to mother her siblings anymore. Em started flipping out. D constantly had her phone taken off her and was never allowed out of the house. That was when em looked through the messages on d's phone. There was a conversation between her and a friend, where the friend offered her drugs but she refused. She also installed a tracker on d's phone so she always knew her location. D was in mcdonalds, when she had lessons scheduled, but instead of talking to about it, she screamed and shouted about how both were bf's fault. U spoke to her teachers and they said that they'd let her leave because she finished her work early. After that, everytime d left the house, em sent her threatening and berating messages about how ""useless"" she is. Em refused to even look at her when she was in the house. D became very depressed. She was actively planning her suicide while refusing to leave her room or even talk to anyone. U found out about this. He spent a whole day just getting her out of the house and into his car. She took only the essentials with her. U gave her a room in his house but it still took over a month to get her to open up about everything. Em still insists that bf is one of the worst people on the planet. He's probably the sweetest guy in the world. D wasn't going to have an 18th party (because u couldn't afford it) so he told his parents to use the money for his party on her instead. I think the worst part is that em turned up at u's house on d's 18th birthday to give d a car and hope that she'd just forgotten what had happened. D just took the keys, mumbled a ""thanks"" and went back to her room. D and bf have been together for over a year now and are saving to buy an apartment together. She has nothing to do with em anymore and still texts her sisters regularly. TL;DR: Mother makes her daughter suicidal because she's too lazy to actually be a parent. Then she thinks a car will fix everything. Edit: thank you kind stranger, for the silver! Edit 2: omg a gold too! Guys I'm actually going to cry. Thank you!!!",
814,"Kim Kardashian cryingI live in an 8 unit building. There is a woman and her daughter who live above me and are driving me up a wall. The mom and daughter are almost constantly arguing and yelling at each other, stomping, slamming doors. The daughter is always crying and repeatedly crying or screaming ""I can't do this anymore."" She cries for hours and hours - it sounds like Kim Kardashian ugly crying. It does sound like she is just being dramatic and obnoxious, I don't know if she is actually suicidal. I'm not sure how old the daughter is. I think she might be a student somewhere, she was there a lot in summer blasting music (I moved there in June), then it was dead silent for months and now the arguing and music playing has picked up again since a few weeks ago. I can hear them yelling loudly but I can only hear pieces of what they're saying. There is a leasing office on site, I've stopped there twice to complain. I've called the main office that's offsite and they said they would sent a noise violation. I am not sure if they ever did, but clearly that hasn't worked. I've tried calling the police (non emergency) and they won't do anything unless it's physical, even though I stressed that it sounds like the daughter is suicidal. I've only seen the daughter in passing, so I'm not sure if she is young enough that I can call CPS. I have not gone up there to say anything myself. They both seem quite unstable and I am a very small person. I don't want them to retaliate against me in any way. I have a feeling the daughter will just become more obnoxious. I don't know what to do. I miss my peace and quiet and I still have 5 months before my lease is up.",
815,"The time my mom pretended to call the psych-ward on meThe title says it all tbh, but I'll go on anyway. Obligatory ""I'm new to reddit and can't into formatting"". [TW: discussion of suicide] I think it's also important to say I'm not 100% sure my mom is a narc. She was apparently diagnosed with bipolar at a young age (something she now denies, a whole other story) but personally I(24F) think she shows more symptoms of borderline or npd. Needless to say it's one of the unholy triumvirate of disorders. I was somewhere between 14 and 16, my memory of this period is pretty bad and I was a late bloomer so to speak, so it's hard to tell exactly how old I was. Nmom and I were fighting as we usually did, I'm not exactly sure about what. To give some context though, I was a pretty stereotypically good child, and her yelling at me up until bedtime for increasingly minor infractions happened probably 1/2 of all nights. She had a tendency to send me off to my room for ""talking back"", and then follow me up there a few minutes later to yell at me some more. Every time this shit happened either I or both of us would end up crying. Anyway, this was probably one of those fights. For whatever reason she asked me during this particular fight if I'd been having suicidal thoughts. I kept insisting that I hadn't, which was partially true. At the time I'd been feeling pretty down, which maybe she was picking up on. Specifically I was feeling pretty unhappy and useless and had frequently fantasizedabout disappearing, not running away, just having my existence erased as to not burden my family anymore. (As a side note I vaguely remember telling people my favorite time of day was sleeping and how NO ONE in my life saw that as a sign of depression is fucking amazing). Even after initially denying it, she kept pressing for several minutes, and she genuinely seemed concerned at the time, saying things like ""if you do, I need to know because I want to support you"" and ""we can make it better together"". Eventually as she kept insisting for several minutes, even admitting that she had suicidal thoughts as a young person, I began to think ""maybe what I've been thinking kinda is suicidal"". So like the dumb kid I was, I finally said yes, I'd been having suicidal thoughts. She suddenly got very cold, looked me in the eyes and asked ""really?"" I said ""I guess so yeah"", and again she said, even more sternly, ""really?"" Again I responded in the affirmative. Maybe I looked unsure to her, I don't remember, but her response is something I still haven't forgiven her for: ""If you're really suicidal, I can't take care of you anymore."" I was like ""wut"", just completely in shock. She walked into her bedroom which was nearby, picked up the phone and her phonebook, and started flipping through it and dialing numbers. I remember I was scared and crying at this point, and begging to know who she was calling, and she very coldly responded after briefly ignoring me that she was ""calling [mental hospital near where I live], if you're suicidal, I just don't have the resources to help you."" I was probably begging ""no no please"" and all that while she pretended to talk to their receptionist or whatever. She said something like ""Hi, my name is [her name] and we live at [our address], my daughter is suicidal and I'm afraid I can't keep her safe anymore, I need you to come pick her up"". She pretended to talk to whoever for a little while and if this wasn't clear already, I believed her 100%, and by this point I was a sobbing mess balled up on the stairs outside her bedroom. Finally she hung up the phone and said in that same cold tone ""they said theyll be here in about 30 minutes."" I don't think I said much, I just cried, and she kept up the act, saying shit like ""i just cant take care of you honey"" and ""i don't know what you want me to do, but i have to do the right thing. I basically felt like my life was over, and i told her that. Basically I was upset that I wouldn't see the few friends I did have, that I might get behind on my homework, and that everyone at school would think I was crazy. I told her I didnt understand how she could do that to me. It had been about 15 minutes since she hung up the phone, and she finally said ""I lied"". I didn't understand, and she explains ""no one's coming"". I was speechless. I don't think I even responded, and she elaborated: ""I needed to teach you that lying about suicidal thoughts is a big deal."" My memory gets fuzzy after she said that, but nothing major happened, I probably just cried in my room for a while. This memory is one of the clearest I have from that time, which is sad. This whole incident has gotten worse to me as I've gotten older, as it became apparent how fucking needlessly cruel and ridiculous it was. Ironically I started having full on suicidal thoughts soon after this incident that lasted in varying degrees for years. The story isn't over yet though, because the was shes warped this event in her mind is morbidly fascinating. In the early years following this fight, Nmom would occasionally ask ""why do you hate me so much"" to which I'd always respond ""I don't"", because I didn't, but she wouldn't accept that. ""Is it because of that one time?"" Early on I refused to talk about it with her, but eventually I started to realize she was a problem (as well as me, at the time I considered a C grade on a test as warranting her ""punishment"", but I know better now). I started to engage her on it, like ""yeah, you were an asshole"". She in response started to do her usual guilt thing ""oh wanna throw salt in my wounds? Go ahead"" and ""I'm a terrible mother and you're just perfect aren't you"". It worked, I felt guilty for making HER feel guilty for for something she did. In college the incident came up again, this time I brought it up, when my mom was asking for reasons why she was a bad mother. She yelled at me and called me immature for being stuck in the past. It worked. Finally, just last year the incident came up once more, in the same context. This time though, her response was different, she denied even remembering it at first, but when I started relaying the events to her, she exclaimed ""you were THREATENING suicide and I was SCARED, i didn't know what to do!!!"" I was fucking floored, there was screaming, i called her delusional, again I don't remember much. I genuinely believe this is how she remembers it now, and it bothered me for a long time. Even though I'm in a safe place now and we're on peaceful if distant terms, a part of me wants closure on this as well as a REAL apology. I considered sending a letter to her describing everything I was angry at her for and even wrote most of it out, but my desperation for closure died down into more of a simmering frustration. One thing I've learned however, and if there's anything yall take from this wall of textl let it be this: it's not mature to forgive, nor is it immature not to forgive. If someone did something to you that took away something inside, something you're still struggling to find, how is forgiveness the moral thing to do? It can be the practical thing to do if it helps you move on. But it can also be impractical if it enables the abuse to continue in some way. Maybe some day I'll forgive her, but I can't force it, and it probably won't be for a long time. Don't let anyone try to force you to feel a certain way before it's time, and please please PLEASE don't forgive people for their sake, do it for yourself. You're not responsible for how people feel about what THEY did to you. Anyway, thanks for coming to my fucking TedTalk TLDR: Nmom convinces me to admit to feeling suicidal, proceeds to pretend to call the psych-ward on my ass, let's me believe I'm getting taken away for 15 min to ""teach me a lesson about lying""",
816,"Daughter is spoiled but also depressed, and potentially suicidalMy daughter (12) has been acting spoiled and antisocial for a while now. As a single mom I'm usually stuck at work so from my limited interactions I thought she was little more than a typical rebellious teen, but recently during the break I spent more time with her and learned about her depression. Before the break though, I just thought she was spoiled. I cook, do her laundry, and buy her a lot of what she wants, but she just locks herself in her room looking at her computer all day and yells at me for the slightest things. She's openly wished several times for me to be gone. She doesn't want to meet any new people and doesn't have any real life friends, but she is very active in Internet communities with her online friends who are really the only people she talks with. Considering all this I was going to try pushing her to meet new people but also disciplining her since she won't discipline herself, and in fact I've already started limiting her phone usage. The problem is that she recently came out to me as depressed and said that she's contemplated killing herself. I was shocked. I cried. I think a big part of it is my fault. But at the same time she still screams at me, stays in her room, and hasn't tried anything to improve her life despite my suggestions and I want to help so much but I don't know *what* to do. If I discipline or argue with her, she gets angry and I'm afraid of pushing it too hard and worsening her depression. I'm planning to find a therapist even though she said she doesn't need one, but I don't know if she'll even open up to a therapist. So, what can I do? Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.",

The rest of the family is not on board with providing that level of enabling. I am extremely worried about what might happen to my sister as she deals with this. She was apparently in the funeral home the other day screaming over her body “I want you back” as she couldn’t get a hold of herself. I’m terrified for her. I want so bad to help her but I am her worst enemy for reasons I’ll never understand. The best way I’ve had it explained to me so far is that “addicts (yes she has alcohol and substance abuse too) are always mad at someone. It gives them a reason to be a victim and if they’re a victim, they have a reason to drink”. As her older sister, I’m an easy target. Does anyone have experience with this? Can they make it through losing someone so important as their supportive mother. And no fault to my mom by any means-she was doing the best she could in an extremely tough situation.

826,"I ( 19 M ) would feel really guilty if my ex ( 19 F ) did anything stuping and don't know how to get rid of that feeling Just for clarification, I do not want to get back with this person. Neither does she with me. I absolutely will never want to have anything with her again because of all the bad things she's done to me which I will explain in this post. So, what is the point of this post? Well, due to her suicidal past and since she clearly is mentally unstable , I am scared she might do something bad and that then that thing will haunt me for the rest of my life and I will only feel guilt for the rest of my life. Now, I'd like to hear your guys feedback after I tell you our story whether or not should I feel guilty if she does something . I don't think I am a bad person for not caring about her future and only caring about possible effects her potential shit could have on me ( for example, huge guilt if she harms herself ) because she's been the worst person on this planet towards me for a long time. Basically we met when we were 17. We broke up after 12 months in our relationship. First 6 months were perfect , she was constantly doing so so so so many things for me but these 6 months were masked by 1. honeymoon phase and 2. her acting like she's a good person . The last 6 months were hell for me. She was CONSTANTLY creating drama and bitching about every single thing while I was only trying to make things right. She was always unhappy with anything I did . She then broke up with me. After breaking up, I found out some things about her past that she didn't tell me and basically kept it a secret ( for example, told me she only had 1 bf before me but she actually had 3, and despite that being A LONG TIME AGO I still felt like it was shitty that she hid it . ) However, that didn't stop me for trying hard for her again. I spent the next 6 months after breakup doing EVERYTHING in my power to win her back. I went out of my way to try to win her back. I would go to her house in 2 in the morning to bring her snacks if she said she was hungry. I would text her 24/7 and reply immediately because she ""didn't like when if I didn't reply soon"". Literally, anything and everything. Nothing worked. She still talked to other guys, went on dates but still claimed that all of those were ""friendly"" dates and that there was nothing between them. To be honest, I didn't trust her because those were clearly dates ( other guys coming to pick her up in a car, going to secluded places with them, bars and so on ). But I didn't complain because I didn't want to seem like an insecure annoying guy. I just continued trying to win her back. Now, the biggest problem occurred at our high school prom in May this year . Basically, she spent the night dancing with one of her ""guy friends"" from ""friendly"" dates . I asked her for a dance and she told me that I have like 3 seconds to move out of her way or she is going to cause a scene. She completely ruined my confidence and that night. Later during the night, I was even sitting with my guy friends and she approached our table and told me ( in front of everyone ) how I don't even have the courage to approach her and that it's weird that she has to approach me . I was clearly embarrassed. She also went to prom with another guy despite promising me that we would go together even after breaking up. After all of that I was just sick of her behavior and during the prom approached another girl. I spoke to her and we had a great time. That girl that I approached is my old friend from like 5 years back that I didn't speak for a long time because my ex thought there was something more than a friendship between me and her and there wasn't. We had a great time, I even forgot about my troubles with my ex . I hugged that new girl and my ex passed by and saw us. She made a huge scene and embarrassed me again . I found it weird how she didn't want me to even hug other girls while she was okay going on dates with other guys, dancing and doing whatever. I was still an idiot so after the prom I cut off that ex friend from my life despite reconnecting on prom night. I then spent 2 more months literally doing anything I can to win my ex back. I don't even know why I was doing it at that point, I was just blindly in love. Of course, she continued talking to new guys and going on dates while I didn't do the same with other girls. She even needed a job so my dad found her a job for 1 months and she got paid very well despite not really having to do a lot of work. ( my parents adored her because I never told them anything negative she's done to me, only positive things ) . She finished that month of work, got the money and went on a vacation. She still wanted to work when she comes back. She went there and there she went on a date with a guy from our hometown who's been working in that city where she went to for a vacation. She again stated that it's only ""friendly"" and that there is nothing between them. He is much older than us and he is actually my old friend and she met him because I told her about him and how he treated me nice . So she went followed him on instagram and even messaged him. So, after the ""friendly"" date she told me she doesn't want to ever speak to me and she wants us to separate completely and not even talk anymore. She said that she enjoys talking to me and enjoys the attention that I give her but she ultimately doesn't want to have me in her life anymore because she feels like I would be mad if she did something with other guys . So, we tell each other that we will talk again in person when she comes back and see where we're going. ( she told me numerous times that she missed me and that she enjoys talking to me ) . Later , I see an instagram story from that old friend and they are cuddling there and kissing on the beach. Her face doesn't show but I do recognize her because of some of specific things on her body. I text her and she confirms it's her. Basically, I tell her we're done forever, I can't fight for her anymore and that I've felt like she's been leading me on for the past 6 months. If I ever even talked to another girl I knew she would freak out but she always felt like it was okay for her to go out with other guys and do all sorts of things. She tells that to her prom date and the guy messages me and starts threatening me . I get pissed of because she asked another guy to come and threaten me and start insulting her. I am not proud of it , I would have acted differently but she pissed me off way too much. Anyways, after she returns we do go out , grab coffee and talk about everything. I even tell her I am sorry for my words and even tell her that I could go past her kissing that guy and still fight for her if she would be with me. She declines. Later that night, we text a bit and we agree that we will cut all contact because it's the best for us. And we do that. A few days later she contacts my dad for another job, he replies only after 2 days because he was also pissed off at her behavior towards me ( he feels like she only used me, abused me and manipulated me and didn't want to help a person who did this to his son but 2 days later still replied and helped her ) . He replied to her in regards to where to go to and who to contact to get that job ( it's pretty much sorted she only needs to show up ). And she leaves him on seen ! Doesn't even reply . A couple of days later she texts him and wishes him a happy holiday and then leaves him on seen again when he tells her that she can work there if she wants to. Now my question and worry : I am so worried that she is going to do something stupid, for example suicide and that if she does it I will feel guilty about it for the rest of my life. She would always tell me how she wants to kill herself whenever the slightest thing went wrong in her life ( even when we were in a relationship) . She said the same to her cousin and her mom . I even messaged her close cousin about it when she was in a crisis and she told me that my ex is only acting that way for attention. I was always there for her but now..I can't be. She is mentally and emotionally draining and I can't be her emotional tampon while she kisses, cuddles and probably has sex with other people. But I am so scared for my future. I feel like if she does something to her it would be my fault even though I tried everything for her and I definitely shouldn't be the one to be blamed if anything happens but I am still so scared. I can't contact her mom or whoever because 1. she already told mom last year about wanting suicide 2. it would be absolutely stupid for me to contact her mom and tell her that her daughter is suicidal because my ex is the biggest manipulator ever and would probably make it seem like I am the crazy one in that situation and also because her mother can't really change anything. I just wish I never met her because I wouldn't carry this huge burden about her future. Why do I still feel responsible for her future I do not know.. tl;dr ex left me, I fear for her future despite her horrible actions towards me and despite her refusing any sort of relationship with me",
827,"My father-in-law is financially ruining us. He has been living with us while he gives all his money to his former step-daughter and then borrows money from us. My husband is a veteran, was recently diagnosed with PTSD and is having suicidal thoughts. How do I get his dad without harming my husband?This is complicated. My husband is a combat veteran and while he was overseas in Iraq his father was accused of molesting his 16-year-old step-daughter. He was charged but she later said it wasn’t true and so he wasn’t convicted. A couple months before it all came out, his dad had given this girl my husband’s debit card while my husband was serving in Iraq and she spent every dime he made (I just found this out). For years, I have never understood the dynamics in this family. His dad is always asking my husband for money and my husband just gives it to him. I have always put my foot down about him staying here because I have a daughter. He has even called my husband after I said no and guilted him by saying “enjoy sleeping in a bed while your dads on a bench.” This is the only time I saw my husband cry. Fast forward 10 years and the girl that accused him of molesting her is living with him. He told me he wanted to help her get on her feet. I figured the allegations must be false because why else would she be living there? A couple months later he texts me to inform me that he will be staying with us for a couple days because someone called CPS on the his step daughter for allowing her children around a man she accused of molesting her and in order to keep her kids he had to leave while they investigated. At this time my husband was recently diagnosed with PTSD and Major Depression. We had recently had a baby and I had to quit my job because I didn’t make enough to pay for daycare. Then my husband started a downward spiral and lost his job due to his symptoms. I got him one working for my aunt but making much less than what he was at his other job. It’s enough to pay for utilities and household staples but not enough to support our family. I can’t leave the baby with him because he is seriously not stable. I used all our savings to pay our bills for 6 months. We have a little less than 2 months left and we will be homeless with our two kids if the VA don’t give me an answer soon. If he is approved for VA disability, he can go to an intensive in-patient program for PTSD that has been recommended by the VA. We can’t afford to lose the little income he has so he can go now because we won’t be able to pay our utilities and household staples. I didn’t say no to his dad because my husband was having suicidal thoughts. I didn’t want to upset my husband more over a few days but I was annoyed because his father was aware of our financial situation and his son’s declining mental health. A few days has turned into over a month. He has not pitched in a dine and in fact keeps borrowing money from my husband. Money we don’t have. His father works but he gives every dime me makes to that girl to pay her expenses, get her nails done, go to concerts etc. Meanwhile, I’m over here struggling to pay for diapers for his grandson. I finally sat him down a couple nights ago and told him that we are not in a position to be lending him money for him to give away to this girl. I told him his son is not in a position to deal with this right now given his deteriorating mental health. His response: “what’s your point?” I want (so so so badly) to tell him to get out of my house and never come back but I’m worried he may send my husband over the edge. What do I do? I can’t afford to keep him here but I don’t want my husband to get pushed over the edge and kill himself.",
829,"I(19M) can't move on with my life because I am scared my ex(19F) will do something stupid and I'll feel guiltyJust for clarification, I do not want to get back with this person. Neither does she with me. I absolutely will never want to have anything with her again because of all the bad things she's done to me which I will explain in this post. So, what is the point of this post? Well, due to her suicidal past and since she clearly is mentally unstable , I am scared she might do something bad and that then that thing will haunt me for the rest of my life and I will only feel guilt for the rest of my life. Now, I'd like to hear your guys feedback after I tell you our story whether or not should I feel guilty if she does something . I don't think I am a bad person for not caring about her future and only caring about possible effects her potential shit could have on me ( for example, huge guilt if she harms herself ) because she's been the worst person on this planet towards me for a long time. Basically we met when we were 17. We broke up after 12 months in our relationship. First 6 months were perfect , she was constantly doing so so so so many things for me but these 6 months were masked by 1. honeymoon phase and 2. her acting like she's a good person . The last 6 months were hell for me. She was CONSTANTLY creating drama and bitching about every single thing while I was only trying to make things right. She was always unhappy with anything I did . She then broke up with me. After breaking up, I found out some things about her past that she didn't tell me and basically kept it a secret ( for example, told me she only had 1 bf before me but she actually had 3, and despite that being A LONG TIME AGO I still felt like it was shitty that she hid it . ) However, that didn't stop me for trying hard for her again. I spent the next 6 months after breakup doing EVERYTHING in my power to win her back. I went out of my way to try to win her back. I would go to her house in 2 in the morning to bring her snacks if she said she was hungry. I would text her 24/7 and reply immediately because she ""didn't like when if I didn't reply soon"". Literally, anything and everything. Nothing worked. She still talked to other guys, went on dates but still claimed that all of those were ""friendly"" dates and that there was nothing between them. To be honest, I didn't trust her because those were clearly dates ( other guys coming to pick her up in a car, going to secluded places with them, bars and so on ). But I didn't complain because I didn't want to seem like an insecure annoying guy. I just continued trying to win her back. Now, the biggest problem occurred at our high school prom in May this year . Basically, she spent the night dancing with one of her ""guy friends"" from ""friendly"" dates .

She said she ""knew"" there was life after death. We got into it, ending with me telling her that I sharply needed to tell her that her expressions of faith were not helpful to me in crisis, because I DID NOT BELIEVE AS SHE DID.

832,"My 11 year old daughter is self harming, depressed/suicidal, and is fantasizing/reading/drawing about abuse, torture, murder, violence, rape etc.I recently started confiscating my daughter's phone from her in the evenings when she's going to bed as I noticed that she hasn't been sleeping because she's been staying up on her phone. One night last week, after I had taken her phone from her, I decided to check her recent internet activity to ensure she wasn't doing anything that she shouldn't be. However, once I opened the browser, xxx hentai porn popped up in her search history. This alarmed me but I understand that it has become somewhat normal for preteens to be exposed to porn and that this is just a part of going through puberty/growing up. Although, one thing that definitely did alarm me was the nature of a lot of the porn videos she had been watching. Some of the themes included molestation and violence. I decided not to say anything immediately as I did not want to cause her embarrassment or shame before I did some research and fully understood how to handle the situation properly. The next night, after I confiscated her phone once again I decided to look further into the kind of things she has been doing on her phone. I was wary not to invade her privacy but at this stage I felt like it was necessary. I discovered that she has been reading fanfiction with themes of rape, abuse, murder, violence etc. I then went to her messages with her friends. She often spends long periods of time chatting/videocalling with them every day. I understand that she is very close with them, especially one of her friends in particular. I thought she might have mentioned something to them. Once I had spent some time scrolling through their messages, I was deeply disturbed to find out that they were role-playing as characters who were abusive and violent. They speak as the characters in the chat, and they address each other by the characters names. The language they use is extremely explicit and I was truly shocked by the nature of the things they were saying. The language was abusive and nasty. They were discussing murder, abuse, suicide, drugs, alcoholism, torture and violence in general. Not only were they writing about it and role playing, they were also drawing gruseome pictures of the characters in these extremely violent scenarios. Furthermore, in between these conversations in which they are role-playing as the characters, when my daughter would break character - she mentioned that she was depressed, suicidal and had been self harming (specifically cutting) for a few years, that she had even once gone as far as trying to suffocate herself. She has also self-diagnosed herself with having manic depression, bi-polar disorder and adhd. The friend also mentioned that she herself had been purposely starving herself and was currently dealing with bulimia. I feel like the two of them are in very negative mindsets and they are feeding/encouraging each other. I noticed that they would delete portions of the conversation which concerns me as to what was so bad that had to be deleted when everything else that they were saying was considered okay. Her YouTube history is filled with horror stories, murder documentaries and videos on the topic of violence and abuse. She has had a growing interest in serial killers and murder cases. She has also been watching/reading many creepypasta stories. What disturbs me the most is that she is such a nice, well mannered, smart child and is very softly spoken. She apologises for the smallest of things and she even scolds her older siblings for cursing or drinking (they're significantly older than her by 7-11 years). She turns her head away from the TV if there is anything sexual or violent on the screen if we are watching as a family. I don't know if it's because she feels isolated as her siblings are much older (their ages range from 18 to 23) and she is often left out. She spends a lot of time indoors, alone in her room, on her phone. I feel like she was exposed to a lot of this from Tumblr as her siblings had it on their phone and she would use it before she had one of her own. I was aware of the fact that she was already dealing with self esteem/confidence issues. I am unsure of the best way to handle this situation, I'm afraid our family can't afford therapy and I worry that if I approach her myself, it will embarrass her and she will shut us out and hide it completely from us. I also don't know how to deal with the other girl who expressed similar behavior - is it my place to contact her parents? TLDR, I stumbled upon porn on my daughter's device but after more digging it escalated to finding out that she's self harming, depressed/suicidal, she has also been accessing content that is extremely inappropriate for her age on the topics of abuse, torture, rape, molestation, murder etc. It appears her friend is in a similar situation. I am unsure on how to handle this issue.",

837,"NMIL attempted suicide a few days ago. Her daughter, my wife, along with our 4 month old still going to remain NC. NMIL is furious! Quick background: I married daughter of NMom (and BPD too). Daughter finally had it and went NC after birth of our child 4 months ago. NMom saw grandchild several times after birth, but on last visit held child and talked about suicide while crying entire time. Also, talked very negatively about all her ""friends"" which are not good enough to be around her. Spoken about suicide for many years. We decided to go NC because it was unsafe and unhealthy. She threatened legal action to see grandchild, but upset to find out there is no recourse. She has all bad relationships, asked husband to move out, he did and now divorcing husband. She claims to have PGAD (Persistent Gentail Arousal Disorder) after husband moved out. Now acts out with sex and dating (65-yr old on Tinder). Only friends now are at the bar and through dating apps. No real friends have been able to stay in contact as she lashes out with rude and brutal comments and then apologizes like nothing has happened. Pretty much a toxic train wreck. Late the other night she called soon to be ex-husband, he didn't take calls (he's still not NC, but trying), she texted that she was going to take all her pain meds and kill herself, he did not respond, she sent ""taking the first two pills now"", then called continuously. Left messages from ""I love you and miss you"" to ""I hate you and always have"". He provided 1-800 suicide hotline number via text. She stopped calling and went silent. Found out that she called someone else from the bar, took many pills (but not nearly enough to be fatal), and then bar friend called police. She was checked into hospital less than 45 minutes after making final call to husband. She wanted to be helped and found clearly, including leaving the front door unlocked for rescue crew. Now, she is going to come home after the mandatory 72 hour hold and we've passed along that we will still not have contact. She is pissed. I am certain she thought this would gain her access to her grandchild and we'd all feel horrible for her. Thoughts?",

TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM I know that I probably had mold in my house. I had the air tested and it came back negative. I spent $900 for three air samples. A few months later I learned that air testing isn’t always accurate. More hair loss. I went to the dermatologist and asked and had a punch biopsy done on my scalp. The diagnosis was Androgen alopecia. The dipshit told me it was genetic old lady baldness. First my family has really thick hair. Second, I asked her what was happening to my daughter? “Oh, she has a different diagnosis than you; her problems must be something else. I asked 3 times for them to do a nose swab(to test for mold; it’s that simple Nope, they couldn’t do that. I don’t live in a third world country but I am on a humid rock in the middle of the ocean. I had “mold remediation services “ come into my home. They looked at an old water spot on the ceiling and said yep that’s it. And left. No bids. No proposal. Last week I found mold growing on the insides of three door frames downstairs. I finally called my insurance company and told them. The conversation started out”we can help relocate you (don’t surprise us and stay at the four seasons for two months “ and they could help. But then he talked to the adjuster and it became “well, you can try to file a claim but we need an exact occurrence “.

I've always been very openly supportive of the LBGTQ community, long before I came to terms with my own sexuality. If comments get ignorant or aggressive, I'll delete this. I realize that's like saying I'm never shopping at this store again, but I at least need to say it. So a good childhood/early adulthood friend of my brother (30M) committed suicide on monday. My dad was super close to both the son and the father through Boy Scouts. My brother moved out of state, otherwise I'm sure the two guys would have remained super close. Regardless, it was very upsetting. I (32F) have a precious suicide attempt so I knew this would trigger some feelings for my parents. I'm sure it did but my mom was super PC about everything and even remarked that it's (depression) and how can anyone hold that against anyone. Etc. Anyways, my mom said something about the sister's wife and I said I didnt realize she was a lesbian (not to presume a label but for the sake of conversation). My mom said yeah and the dad struggled with it bc he was raised catholic and the bible is against it (in a half joking manner I mentioned the bible's disagreement with bacon, etc) but none of that bothered me. She even said the dad came around bc he saw his daughter was happy. Love it, dream of it. All good. Then my mom proceeds to say how she felt so bad for the dad because he's been through so much. > First a marriage he was unhappy in but ""couldnt"" leave bc of the Catholic's view on divorce; then his daughter comes out; then his son kills himself. She said ""what else could possibly happen"". I said I hardly think his daughter being a lesbian is on par with his son committing suicide. I fully expected her to correct herself, it just being a poor choice of phrasing. Instead, in a serious voice, she said it was the same and that to people in their 60's (she's 68) it is just as bad because back then people weren't gay and it wasnt like it is now. We're (our generation) so much more open to these kinds of things. I was shocked. Much like every other moment where my mom, knowingly or not, dismissed my feelings, I said nothing. I dont remember everything she said but the themes and messages one could infer from the above are accurate. It wasnt that finding out your child is gay is difficult and heavy for multiple reasons including the generation you grew up in, It was totally his child coming out as a lesbian is just as bad as his other child committing suicide. I know my mom loves me and I honestly believe she'd accept me as pansexual after many tears, prayers, and questions (and I'm ok with that). But this hurt. And perhaps what made it hurt the most was this very thing was something I spent years mulling over with my therapist. Feeling like after everything I put my parents through - depression, addiction, suicide attempt, etc. - that being pansexual was one more thing I was punishing them with. One more way to let them down. My friends always assured me that was not the case. To hear my mom articulate the very fears I had finally quieted (after years) was overwhelming. My friend suggested I tell them. That perhaps putting it out there will help remove the terror and ignorance. That they wouldn't say those things if they knew. But having heard those things makes it even harder to want to tell them. Am I overreacting? My friend was empathetic and kind but I felt like she thought I should chalk it up to them not knowing. She agreed it was hurtful and it was ok to be hurt, but also not to take it too seriously. I'm sick of the excuse that my parents dont know. You shouldn't have to have an LGBTQ child to not feel those things. Ugh. Thanks for reading ... xoxo",

I just don't know how I missed this. I can understand some of what she is feeling, because my parents divorced when I was 15 and I suffer from bipolar 2. So depression is not a new thing to me.

When she was still a boy, and started expressing a want to be a girl, I did everything right. Therapists, then puberty blockers, everything. Now she is 20 and everything is falling apart. We had to hold off on the body surgery because of costs, but now finally had enough and went and got several consults. All have said the same thing. The puberty blockers have left her with a micro penis. She has to get part of her vagina made with her colon. Well one of her friends had that surgery, and even years later it smells fairly colon like. Obviously my daughter is now distraught. She is in counseling, but is becoming worse and worse in her mental state and I am frantic. On top of this, she has never had any sexual function. NO urges, no erections, even when she tried masturbation to see if she could stimulate herself...nothing. The doctors say this may not change even after the surgery. Her dating life is dismal as well. We knew it would be hard. But its impossible. The one man who was with her for a while, soon just became frustrated by her lack of sexual anything and broke it off. I don't know what to do? A friend suggested I post here for advice. Please help me help my child!",

852,"[Support] Parent of a teen daughter here, with real worries - one of her friends is sending out text messages about cutting and self-harm. Not prepared for this... [TW: self-harm, suicide]Hope this is a proper subreddit for this. 13 year old girls have two x chromosomes, right? Seriously, I lurk a LOT because quite frankly I find it really insightful. I should probably point out also that I am the Dad, not the Mom. Anyway, I'm really hoping the hive mind can help with some insight into the social dynamics of 13-14 year-old girls. I don't know what the best approach is. Here is what I do know: My daughter is 13, and is friends with a group of 5-6 eighth-grade girls I can safely call ""misfits."" I mean that in a loving-ish way - they are a strange amalgam of nerds, goofs, outcasts, and slackers, not the cute-perky-petite-popular type(s). They text CONSTANTLY. Hundreds of times a day. My daughter does not participate in this anywhere near as much - she is generally busy - athletics, band, and a 94-95 average across all her courses - so she kind of phases in and out periodically of their extended conversations. One other girl in her peer group is an Honors student, the rest are not (a couple only made it to 8th grade from 7th thanks to social promotion, IIBH). Two of the other girls in the group have ""come out""; recently, my daughter ""semi"" came out as well, as in ""I think I might be bi."" She has feelings-ish for one of the girls in the peer group (the Honors student, I was relieved to hear, and if that makes me a bad parent, so be it). That girl is one of the two who came out. The other girl who came out -- let's call her ""Jasmine"" -- appears to have feelings for my daughter. This girl, Jasmine, has been increasingly clingy-ish (if it is possible to be clingy by text) of late. Needy might be a better word. Two days ago, she sent a message saying that she was going to cut herself (or was thinking about it, but ""chickened out,"" her words) and wrote that she need to talk to my daughter RIGHT NOW. But she accidentally texted it to the whole group. And shit just exploded. Now all the parents know, the girls are all traumatized, and my wife and I don't know what the hell to do other than show our daughter as much support as possible and urge her to talk to us ANYtime she needs to. But since then, ""Jasmine"" has been texting about it incessantly. ""Would you guys even miss me?"" That kind of thing. One of my daughter's friends has been having panic attacks as a result. And ""Jasmine"" has been texting my daughter privately more and more, making it feel to her like the burden is on her to ""save"" Jasmine, etc... And the fact that she believes that Jasmine has feelings for her is making her feel even more obligated to ""save"" her, keep her secrets, etc... At the same time, our daughter did NOT tell us -- we found about it from a text by one of the girls' parents. I think she thinks that we'll think she's doing something bad. We have tried to convince her that we're not upset with her, or mad at anything she has done, but we don't know to both RESPECT and PROTECT her at the same time without demonizing Jasmine in the process and/or making our daughter feel like she has failed as a friend (or even as a daughter) somehow. Help?? ------------ **UPDATE** About 20-30 minutes ago (around 11 pm local time), ""Jasmine"" sent the following flurry of texts: ""Don't even care anymore. I could die right now for all I care."" / ""Then this stupid pointless existence would end and people would be better off."" To which one of her fucknugget friends (I know I lovingly called them ""misfits"" earlier, but this one girl really rubs me the wrong way - she's kind of the mama bear of the troupe) texted ""ok."" Jasmine texted in response: ""Goodbye."" I grabbed the phone and called Jasmine's dad **straight away**, had him check on her ASAP and grab her cell phone and read her messages. I left it in his hands, but after I post this I'm going to email my daughter's guidance counselor at school too. Fuck, I hope he is not part of the problem.",

My daughter essentially said ""come home and it will be okay"" I am worried it won't be okay because I know his family well. His dad is currently bishop and neither of his parents ""believe in depression"" and think it is sin or negativity (common for Mormons). He was totally ignored when he said he was deeply depressed in high school, in fact they mocked it and openly criticized him. Of course he can stay with us, but that won't change what awaits him. **I am also worried** they won't let him come home but will send him back to BYU where he was depressed. We live in a small rural area where members are very nosy. He would have zero privacy and a hoard of people ""persuading"" him the minute he got off the plane. I am not sure such a fragile kid will be able to withstand the alienation and helpful brainwashing coming his way. **I need advice**..we aren't sure what to do and we want him to be safe and taken care of. We are worried the mission president will talk him out of it, or his parents will or they will send him over the edge mentally before we can get to him and help him.

I feel like part of this is my fault and now its too late.I am not sure if this is the right place for this. &#x200B; My daughter died from cancer, a very fast acting cancer which she choose to not get treatment for. Over the span of 4 months, she deteriorated and then died. During this time, my husband turned into a severe alcoholic and drug abuser. I got depressed, as did my son. Watching my daughter, the sweetest child in the world, pass away like that was horrific. &#x200B; My husbands alcoholism (and drug abuse, he was doing pills heavily as well, although tried to keep it secret) spiraled out of control to the point where he was drinking a 20 dollar bottle of vodka every day, and then some more after. He would often go out and not come home for the entire night. My son kept on trying to get him to stop, and I sort of tried... but I was so depressed that I just didnt have the heart to put in much emotional effort into him. I isolated myself completely, and was like a zombie. My husband died in our basement bathroom, covered in his own vomit. He died from a mix of huge amounts of alcohol and huge amounts of xanax and tramadol mixed together. I knew he was doing pills, but I never knew the real extent of it until we found his stash of pills after he died. His death came about 3-4 months after my daughters death. &#x200B; After my husband died, I sort of woke up from my daze, but not for long before I fell back into it. My son also fell into a horrible, deep depression. It wasn't only his dad and sister dying. His grades fell apart, he got rejected from almost every college except for community colleges. He gained well over 100 pounds in the year after his dad died. Both of us were just a mess. I didn't leave bed most days, he stayed in his room... doing whatever he would do. Video games I imagined. I didn't ignore the signs completely the way I did with my husband. I tried to reach out to him, get him into therapy, for a while. But my own depression was so bad that I was giving up on everything. I think at a certain point we just left each other alone. &#x200B; In the 2 months before, we barely spoke at all. It wasn't hard, our house is big, our rooms are far apart. And then he tried to kill himself, by throwing himself off of a bridge nearby. He survived. He got a broken foot and his toe is all mangled, but he survived. I saw where he threw himself off, it was a long distance. I don't even know how he managed to only break his foot. &#x200B; I feel such a wave of guilt flow over me since the incident. Both for him and for my husband too. I didn't pay enough attention, I didn't give them what they needed, I was selfish honestly. I am their mother and wife and I just isolated myself instead of being with them and helping them and getting them through this. I constantly think that if I was more attentive, more demanding for my husband to get sober, then this wouldn't have happened. None of it. Losing my daughter was horrible, but we couldn't control that. But this? This is our decisions. And my presence influences their decisions arguably more than anything. &#x200B; I just don't know what to do. I want to help my son but don't know how, and I feel he is ignoring my attempts to help him, because I have ignored him for so long. I can't tell if he is still suicidal. I can't tell if the second his foot heals he is going to try again. I am 'awake' in that I am aware of my being and place instead of being a depressed zombie like I have been for the past 2 years... but I am feeling hopeless again that I cant help.",

881,"I [22F] have had severe depression for ten years, and my mum [53F] is my main support system - starting to feel really guilty because I'm ruining her lifeSo to cut a long story short about me - mental illness, particularly depression and anxiety, runs in my family (both sides), and I've had it (diagnosed) since I was twelve, with a few others things like PTSD thrown in for variety at some points along the way. Not gonna lie, life for me has not been a good time. In the early years, my external life was good and only my internal life was the problem, but slowly it became a vicious circle and my external life started to collapse too. Today, I have major anxiety that affects pretty much everything. I'm at university, desperately trying to complete my final year (late), and things just never look up. I don't really have any friends (social anxiety, and also sleeping all day instead of going out), I just got out of an emotionally abusive relationship (which I realise now I was a perfect target for), am basically failing my classes (although I'm technically a 'disabled student' and the university is very understanding). Things just aren't good. I never have good news. My mum is an absolute saint. Like, seriously, 100% for real. She was one of those people who was just born to be a mother, has that mothering instinct down perfectly. She makes so many sacrifices for me. In the grand scheme of things, I do believe I'm a good daughter, but she's the only support system I have, so I end up relying on her way more than is fair. She doesn't complain and never wavers. She'll pick up if I call her in the middle of the night (though I've tried to stop doing that now, I feel too guilty), she'll listen to me cry about whatever, she'll call the doctor for me if I'm having an anxiety attack. My university is five hours away from where she lives, and one time she literally drove all the way to me just to take me to a psychiatry appointment because I was in a bad way, and then drove all the way back. Saint. I just feel so guilty. At first it's like, well, she's my mum, she signed on for this when she chose to have me, and also she works with mentally disabled people for her job. But on the other hand... I thought I'd be better by now. Ten years of her dealing with hearing her daughter is suicidal. I thought I'd be able to give her good news by this point. I've dreamed of the day I can say to her, hey, things are looking up, thanks so much for your help, we did it! But things just keep getting worse... ...I tell her less and less about what's going on. I attempted suicide last year and hid that from her, which is the first significant thing I hid from her. I promised her I would never kill myself, for her sake, and I truly intend and intended to keep that promise, but I got really really really drunk one night and things just got messy. I feel like there's no way i can tell her that, because if I do she'll go back to being terrified she could get a phonecall at any minute saying I'm dead or whatever. I don't want that for her. It's bad enough as it is, what I do to her. But I don't know what to do. It keeps getting worse and worse and I don't know what i should hide from her and what I shouldn't. Today I've been very, very suicidal. God a bunch of bad news and things are not looking good. I'm really at a loss. And I just got a text from her saying she loves me, how am I doing? I feel heartbroken. I feel I need to lie to her and tell her things are okay. She doesn't go on about it a lot, but she does mention, when I'm going through a bad time she feels terrible, she can't eat, she can't sleep, she cries at work. I feel so guilty. And I can understand it. I've heard people on Reddit say the worst moment of their life was hearing their child was suicidal, and my mum's been hearing that for ten years. We have a very close relationship. We laugh and joke, and we're definitely friends. I put a ton of effort into gifts for her at christmas etc. But what can I do to make up for the burden I am on her life? My plan was always to just recover, and live a good life, because I know that's all she wants. But now I don't know if I will recover. My questions: 1. What can I do to make up for all she does for me? 2. Should I keep hiding things from her? Or give her a condensed version of the truth, or what? 3. Has anyone been in either her or my situation before, can give a new perspective? Thanks, sorry for long post. Tldr; I've been suicidal for over a decade, my mum is a saint and my main support network. But I feel very guilty for putting this all on her, especially as it's not getting better.

Almost a year ago one of my mother's doctors at a hospital called me up to talk to me about hospice for my mother. I needed to make a decision before they sent her back to the nursing home. The next evening I went to my boyfriend's house. I wanted someone to talk to about this and I wanted to be comforted. Instead he wanted to discuss this other woman he wanted to see then asked me if I wanted to go home. I asked to stay because I didn't want to drive home in the storm. It was the first time we didn't cuddle when I stayed over. All I could think about that night was how earlier that year he had been willing to go over to a friend's house in the middle of the night and comfort him when his dog ran away, but that he wasn't willing to comfort me when I was having to make this choice about my mother. And how he had barely any time for me the last year and didn't even acknowledge my concern over it. I ended things the next morning even though it broke my heart. My internal dialog the last year has been that I have less value than a dog. Less than 2 weeks later my mother was dead. She died in restraints in a hospital because the nursing home counselor decided to declare her mentally competent to avoid working with the hospice that I choose. Basically hospitals will take patients off psychiatric medications if they are a a risk to their physical problems and this lead to my mother becoming violent and they had to put her in restraints. If she had been in the hospice care she would have been on her medication and would have died less violently. After my mother's death my daughter's therapist informs me that my daughter is suicidal and that my husband is responsible because he has been verbally abusive while I had been so focused on caring for my mother. I got a job and my daughter ended up in a mental hospital and my husband moved out and was getting counseling. We were still trying to work things out and he was allowed to visit on weekends. I would let him spend the night if he and I were out late together. One night I explained to him that I had no interest in having sex, that I was depressed and it was off the table. He spent the night that night and he violated me in my sleep. All the while I still had the internal dialog that I have less value than a dog. My ex has been saying he still wanted to be friends, but for the first 6 months he was definitely perusing me as more than a friend up until my husband moved out. I stopped being able to sleep in my bed and had to tell my doctor who is also a good friend what happened with my husband in order to get sleeping pills. My husband is no longer welcome at the home of my oldest friend. I am on anti-depressants for the first time in my life. They were even doubled recently. And today when I am getting close to the one year anniversary of when this horrible year started I have no one to turn to. I am certainly not calling on my husband. Everytime I see my ex I think about the fact that I have less value than a dog. And today my ex is gaming with all my closest friends who I could even imagine turning to. So I am here whining. I just feel so hopeless and lonely today.",
883,"A month ago tomorrow I had sterilization surgery, and two days ago I found out I was 7.5 weeks pregnant. My abortion is this afternoon and we're dreading it.We never wanted to be in this position and thought we had done everything right. I got pregnant on birth control (again) four weeks before my surgery, and somehow it wasn't caught (nothing showed on a urine test then somehow.) I never believed I could be carrying a viable pregnancy, let alone one this far along. I told everyone around me I was pregnant, but ""my body just had to be confused"" and now I'm lying to everyone around me and telling them the baby is not viable and has no heartbeat. My husband and I feel awful... But we are in no position to carry this out. I am already so sick...we opted for sterilization after one pregnancy because of how bad that pregnancy was... Nine months of the worst nausea and vomiting imaginable, pain everywhere all the time that still plagues me, and a year of severe PPD/fighting suicidal ideation before I got my head back on straight. I don't need to go through the laundry list of other reasons this is not right for us...we can't do it...it's not fair to this child, who wouldn't get everything it needs or deserves, my current child who would have to be pushed to the back-burner, and we'd somehow have to make ends meet. We have no family and no help with our current child and are always tired and to some extent overwhelmed.... and now I can't stop vomiting? I've been puking since 1:30 this morning, and during the day I'm so exhausted it constantly feels like the middle of the night... Despite how justified this is, I'm dreading it. I should be able to go through with the pill abortion but that itsself gives me so much fear and dread.... I'm just scared and sick about this whole thing. Has anyone gone through this....? I'm so lucky to have such an amazing supportive husband and my sister in law is taking my little one for about three hours so we can go to the clinic... I just hate my life right now though and I'm not really sure what to do to get through the next week or two. Edit: thanks so much for the kindness ♥️ I am blown away by the support I've received here this morning, and I'll be going in this afternoon in a much better mental state than I was when I woke up this morning- so thank you all for this. I want to respond to everyone but right now I need to get off Reddit and snuggle my daughter until her aunt picks her up. Again, thank you all so much. You have no idea how much it helps. ♥️",
884,"The time my MIL tried to milk me like a dairy cowTW sexual assault No you cannot copy, publish or broadcast in any way this story or any parts of it in any shape or form. I posted this months ago and it was stolen by a news site so i deleted it in a panic. I'm a real journalist, if you steal people's stories from reddit and publish them, you're not a journalist you're a thief. Ok, on to the story. This happened 8 months ago so no advice needed. I am NC and MIL is not allowed near me or LO. I had an awful pregnancy- severe depression, panic and anxiety attacks, and was also bleeding for 6 out of 9 months. I was on strict bed rest and became extremely depressed and even suicidal. Towards the end of my pregnancy i told SO i didn't want anyone but him at the hospital and no visitors for 2 weeks. He disagreed and said it would cause a huge family drama as his mother expected to be in the delivery room and be round every day at home. In their culture i would also be expected to entertain family every day for 40 day's. I was very vulnerable and weak at this time and i ended up getting him to agree to changing hospital and telling his mum 2 hours after birth. We agreed no to 40 day's of visitors, but that they could come but only after calling in advance. I ended up having an emergency csection due to my declining health and he called his mother two hours later. She bustled into my hospital room when baby was sleeping and picked her up, waking her at the same time. Baby started to cry so i took her and attemped to breastfeed with colostrum. I was overwhelmed, drugged up, vulnerable, exhausted, still depressed, emotional, scared and a bit out of it so i couldn't properly react to what she was about to do. Before i knew it, MIL had her hand on my nipple and was crushing it, forcing it into my daughters mouth. She proceeded to milk me like a goat while i completely zoned out in shock and horror. I froze, my blood ran cold and i didn't know how to deal with this vile woman manhandling my breast like a dairy farmer with a prize Jersey. Thankfully my daughter cried a lot and she backed off and i fed her with formula instead, which of course she criticised. I ended up not being able to breastfeed and my milk drying up overnight about 10 days later because every time i tried to feed my baby, all i could see was that fucking horrific old bint with her fingers all over my boobs. It is burned into my mind and even now, eight months later i cannot bear to have my breasts touched because all i see is her. She then spent the next ten day's harassing and criticising my breast feeding efforts to the point i would sit up all night trying to feed, freaking out, dealing with a hungry panicking baby, and pressuring myself because i was scared of her judgement. Eventually, one morning i got up, walked to the shop, bought formula, and fed my baby. Best thing I've ever done.",
885,"A guide to Season 1 of The WitcherThis is not a show that holds hands, and I’ve realized a lot of people not previously familiar with the books or the games are struggling to connect all the dots. Let me be your humble guide. **What the hell is a witcher?** The world of *The Witcher* is the result of an event that took place a thousand years ago called the Conjunction of the Spheres, which deposited a bunch of different species from other dimensions into that world, including humans. Before, it was just the elves and the dwarves, who have now been pushed to the margins of their own world by the resourceful, faster-breeding human race. In order to survive in this new and really fucked up world full of monsters from several dozen other places, the humans figured out how to use certain herbs to mutate children into, for lack of a better word, super-soldiers: witchers. The process, known as the trial of the grasses, kills 70% of the children and leaves the remainder sterile. Geralt received such a heavy dose that it turned his hair white. As you can imagine, handing over a child to the witchers, often due to poverty (this is not a society with orphanages) or as payment for a service a witcher has done a village, is deemed a fairly horrible thing to have to do, and the big-picture necessity of it doesn't help much with community relations. The survivors develop superhuman vision (the yellow eyes) and reflexes, and a limited ability to do magic, super basic stuff like a force push, a momentary shield, a fire burst, or befuddling the mind of a target - not remotely on the same scale as sorcerers. Above all, witchers develop the ability to survive the ingestion of certain powerful potions that temporarily assist in the hunting and killing of monsters (for example, one potion used when hunting vampires turns the witcher’s blood into a toxin that will harm the vampire if the witcher is bitten). The children are trained by senior witchers: Geralt is part of the School of the Wolf, for example, based out of the far northern fortress of Kaer Morhen. Then they're sent out into the world to wander the land as professional monster exterminators. They’re very long-lived, but the dangerous nature of their careers means they rarely die in bed. Witchering is ultimately a trade like any other (they’re not heroes - they demand payment), but it's one that sets them apart. They're needed, but also feared and hated. In part it's because their trade forces them to travel in an era of xenophobia, in part their fucked up appearance, and finally because monster problems usually develop due to some sort of moral rot within the community that no one wants to admit to - murdered lovers returning as wraiths, that sort of thing. In some cases, witchers have done their part to contribute to the problem by breaking bad, once very memorably en masse - the School of the Cat began hiring out as assassins and was ultimately destroyed. As human society evolves out of the dark ages, witchers are also becoming less common: monsters are rarer than they used to be, and growing populations make “brute force” options like sending a couple hundred soldiers to do the job of slaying a monster more feasible - if usually far more messy, like resolving a hostage crisis with a cruise missile. As witchers become less necessary, they also become more hated. **What’s all this political stuff?** Edit: here's a map: [https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/aa4wj8/map\_of\_the\_witcher\_world/](https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/aa4wj8/map_of_the_witcher_world/) The Witcher is set in a vague analogue to eastern Europe in the middle ages. The “northern kingdoms” are a bunch of squabbling, backwards, superstitious fiefdoms and petty warlords. To their south lies the Empire of Nilfgaard, which is (ironically) a model of technological and social progress by that world's standards, except for their unfortunate desire to forcibly absorb all the northern kingdoms, which they’ve been accomplishing piecemeal for decades. In the north, an Illuminati-style Brotherhood of Sorcerers influences everything by providing advisers to all of the rulers. In Nilfgaard, sorcerers are treated as tools and kept on a short leash by the state. In the north, elves and dwarves are hated, feared, and marginalized, very analogous to Jews or Native Americans. In Nilfgaard, elves and dwarves are treated as full citizens. In the north, if you have a monster problem you hire a witcher. In Nilfgaard, you call in the national guard. You get the idea. It’s like Napoleonic France coexisting just next door to twelve flavours of Transylvania. There’s frankly a pretty good case to be made that the citizens of the north would be better off if conquered by Nilfgaard, although since the protagonists are part of the small minority that wouldn’t be better off (rulers, sorceresses, witchers), they don’t see it that way. **Great, fine. What’s the chronological plot?** The story begins with Yennefer, a hunchbacked peasant girl with a gift for magic sold to the northern academy of wizardry, which trains her to become an advisor to kings. The use of magic turns her beautiful and extremely long-lived, but sterile - a tradeoff she happily accepts at the time, but eventually comes to resent. As a result of internal politics, Yen is ultimately sent to advise the northern kingdom of Aedirn, and a sorceress with much less backbone (Fringilla) is sent to Nilfgaard, which over the years becomes a key factor in cementing the subordinate status of wizarding types in the southern empire. Yen spends decades as the power behind the throne in Aedirn, but when the Aedirnian king assassinates his wife and nearly turns Yen into collateral damage in the process, she loses her taste for the game of thrones and decides to live life for herself. Meanwhile (give or take) Geralt, a witcher of the School of the Wolf, rolls into some town in the north named Blaviken to solve whatever local monster problems it’s got. Turns out there are no actual monsters that need defeating. There is, however, a princess named Renfri who was literally born under a bad sign. It’s unclear whether it caused her to become evil or whether everyone treating her as evil caused her to become cruel, but by the time she hits adulthood she’s vicious, vengeful, leading a band of cutthroats and hunting/being hunted by a sorcerer. Geralt is forced to kill her and her gang to prevent further carnage, but not before she prophecies that “the girl in the woods would be with him always” (being born under that sign had *some* magical effect). The resulting bloodbath, the need for which is poorly understood by the locals, earns him the moniker “the Butcher of Blaviken”, which the gruff but ultimately kindhearted Geralt hates. At the same time, somewhere in the northern kingdom of Cintra, a teenaged Queen Calanthe has just won her first battle. It’s the start of an Elizabethan reign. Geralt carries on his life as an itinerant exterminator, stopping along the way to rid the northern kingdom of Temeria from a cursed monster caused by royal incest between King Foltest and his sister, and eventually connects with Jaskier, a travelling bard. They take a shine to each other and begin travelling together. In addition to their friendship, there’s a practical aspect to their partnership: Geralt provides an endless source of material for Jaskier’s songs, and Jaskier acts as a one-man PR department for Geralt, giving him the moniker “the White Wolf” to compete with “the Butcher of Blaviken” and generally making it easier for Geralt to find work, demand higher rates and get paid without incident. Meanwhile in Cintra, Queen Calanthe has grown from teenage military prodigy into dominant warrior queen. After her first husband Roegner died in a plague and despite having feelings for Eist, a prince of Skellige (an island chain of Celtic/Norse reavers off the coast), she remains unmarried so that she can remain squarely in charge. Geralt and Jaskier attend a feast to determine a husband for Calanthe’s daughter Pavetta. It comes out that Duny, a knight cursed to look like a hedgehog, had once saved Roegner’s life and invoked the Law of Surprise as a reward (to give Duny that which Roegner had but did not know). Since Calanthe was pregnant, the reward was Calanthe’s daughter Pavetta, and now Duny is at the wedding feast to claim Pavetta’s hand in marriage. After several attempted stabbings, Pavetta happily accepts, and Calanthe also decides to marry Eist. Duny (no longer a hedgehog) tries to reward Geralt, who invokes the Law of Surprise himself, and surprise…Pavetta’s already pregnant with Ciri, giving Geralt a claim to the child to raise as his own. This is a political disaster and nobody is less pleased than Geralt, who tries to solve the problem by laying no claim to the child and immediately leaving Cintra. Calanthe attempts to make doubly sure of the issue by sending men to kill him, but they fail. Despite his attempt to nip the problem in the bud, Geralt remains troubled. He doesn’t want to admit it, but the Law of Surprise has some magic to it, and by leaving Ciri in someone else’s hands he’s fighting against the current of fate. He does the healthy thing and attempts to resolve his unease by fishing a djinni in a bottle out of a lake to wish for a good night’s sleep. Shenanigans ensue, and Geralt and Jaskier travel to the nearest town to seek assistance saving Jaskier’s life. This is where they first meet Yen, who runs the place and is evidently happier ruling in hell than serving in heaven, so to speak. Yen tries to take advantage of the situation by capturing the djinn to become all-powerful, but the djinn nearly kills her. Geralt saves Yen by using his last wish to ask for their fates to be bound together (and since the djinn can't hurt its master, saving Yen's life). It’s such a powerful wish that it’s not clear whether the djinn was in fact capable of granting it, but if it did, it explains why over the ensuing years, Geralt and Yen keep running into each other, which next occurs on a dragon hunt that Yen is undertaking in an attempt to regain her lost fertility. During that hunt, Yen needles Geralt about his hypocrisy for lecturing her about accepting what can’t be changed while all this time neglecting the child that fate had bestowed on him. It’s the last straw, and Geralt nuts up and returns to Cintra to check in on Ciri and ensure her well-being. In the intervening years, Ciri’s parents (Duny and Pavetta) have died in a shipwreck and Calanthe and Eist are raising Ciri, who is now heir to the Cintran throne. Geralt gets an extremely frosty reception. Rumours of war with Nilfgaard (now ruled by an exceptionally capable, ambitious emperor) are circulating in Cintra, but they don’t make sense to Calanthe, who doesn’t think taking Cintra is a wise decision for Nilfgaard from a strategic perspective (Nilfgaard's apparently irrational desire to conquer Cintra is a plot point that won’t pay off until Season 2). Geralt offers to take Ciri away for a time to protect her from the prospect of impending war, but Calanthe rejects the idea, and Geralt is tossed in prison when he refuses to disown Ciri. At this juncture, Nilfgaard launches a snap invasion, shocking Calanthe, successfully defeating the Cintran army, killing Eist, and sacking Cintra. Calanthe urges Ciri to seek out Geralt’s protection, and then commits suicide to avoid the indignity of capture. This is the point in the story when the chronology starts to unite and events begin to move quickly. Ciri escapes the capital with Nilfgaardian hunters hot on her heels, first taking refuge with the dryads in the forest of Brokilon before eventually trying to make her way to her step-grandfather Eist’s family in Skellige. Along the way, a farmer’s wife takes her home to keep her safe, and tries to convince her to stay. As the Nilfgaardian army marches north from Cintra toward the rest of the northern kingdoms, Yen and the other wizard Illuminati move to intercept them at Sodden Hill, a defensible chokepoint about a day away from the farmstead where Ciri is staying. Geralt broke out of Cintran captivity in the chaos, but had no idea that Ciri successfully made it out, too. Geralt, like Ciri and the Nilfgaardians, also travels north from Cintra, in his case heading for the witcher’s keep of Kaer Morhen to lick his wounds and feel sorry for himself over the whole Ciri business. He saves a travelling farmer from ghouls attracted by the bodies of Cintran refugees, but catches a nasty bite in the process. The farmer tosses Geralt in his cart to recuperate. As a wound-fevered Geralt is transported back to the farmer's house, the Battle of Sodden Hill happens close enough to be within earshot, and Yennefer (who Geralt doesn’t know is fighting in that battle) goes MIA after summoning a firestorm that stops the invasion cold. Ciri has a vision of Geralt at Sodden Hill calling out Yen's name, and leaves the farm, cutting through the woods toward Sodden Hill to do as Calanthe urged and connect with Geralt. When Geralt reaches the farm, he realizes that by a cosmic stroke of fate, the wife of the farmer who saved him had found Ciri, who unknown to the farmer’s wife had left just before Geralt's arrival. Geralt recognizes the circumstance from the prophecy made to him by the dying Renfri decades earlier, and hares it into the woods to find the daughter destiny always meant for him to have. They finally meet, and Ciri asks him who the woman is that Geralt was calling out for in her vision (Yennefer), setting up the two of them to travel to the Sodden Hill battlefield in Season 2 to look for Yen, and possibly solve the mystery of why Nilfgaard was so hellbent on conquering Cintra.",

891,"Too much 'bad' in too little time = can't take itSorry in advance for length. Need to word vomit. I'm in a place where I don't even want to post this for fear of feeling ""rejected"" if nobody replies. I've always battled depression, usually in short 3-4 day stints, but this has not lifted for months and only gets darker. I suspect this is the worst so far because it actually has reasons and triggers. My job of 2.5 years closed in January, after a bouncer killed a man (nightclub). I basically lived in the movie Coyote Ugly and a lot of my identity was tied to that. It was also secondhand traumatic knowing someone got fucking beaten to death just feet from my bar. A few weeks before, my goal of being a doctor vanished overnight while dealing with a lot of burnt out hospital docs. 5 years of school and volunteer work suddenly felt useless. 5 days after my work closed down, my dad died suddenly. I was suicidal a few days after. The only reason I didn't let myself drift into oncoming semi trucks was that my dogs were in the car. I told my fiancé and scared the hell out of him. I end up working a shitty waitressing job for 1/4 of the pay, because I can't handle finding a similar job after all that (I was literally not capable of being upbeat and fun enough). I've been dragging myself to it every day. I'm sure they think I'm a misrepresenting piece of shit, I was all ""I'm awesome you won't regret hiring me!"", but my heart is nowhere in the job. I quit today because I just can't anymore. It only made me feel worse because I felt bad about quitting and they just said ""But you can work until May? Ok, bye"". A month ago my fiancé (who has depression and anxiety of his own he refuses to acknowledge & it flares up and fucks with our relationship every few months) tries to leave. I say 'tries' because I was fucking exhausted of his issues and told him go ahead, and he then lived here for another week until I became passively suicidal again and threw him out for my own sanity... At which point he came back sobbing 2 days later... And continued to live here for 2 more weeks in an awful limbo until he decided to try making it work. I suspect deep down he doesn't actually want to leave but he is a mess mentally. He is now a yo-yo where some days he's 'present' and other days he erects a massive emotional wall up. It feels like he was the last piece of armor shielding me from completely losing it after everything else, and now it's been ripped away. That's a lot to pin on one person but it's just the order things happened in, and of course your SO is your primary support system. On one hand I feel like he's toxic, on the other he's all the support I have left. I can't tell my mom ""Hey! I know you just lost your husband but now your daughter is suicidal!"" My friends either think I'm being dramatic and are sick of listening, or mean well and just don't get it. I have been barely hanging on for months now. Today was really, really bad. I have been either sobbing, drunk, or both since 3 pm. It's now 4 am. I'm alone because he got drunk at a friends and stayed over, which is also making me feel even worse because he knew I was crying earlier. I feel like I'm very fragile and just can't handle anything else, however minor, without spinning back into the void of wishing I would stop breathing in my sleep. I wish I didn't feel obligated to keep existing so as not to hurt my mom. Thanks anyone who got through that.",

894,"I feel like a hostage in my daughters life and her siblings don't understand.I don't know where else to go with this. I am not a new Reddit user and this is a throwaway account because my kids know I use Reddit. I have been married for 41 years. I have 6 kids. 4 boys and 2 girls. The oldest is 41 and the youngest is 26. For reference, I had my kids at 20, 22, 25 (my twin sons), 34, and 35. When the older 5 were growing up I was very strict, I had them all on a routine as soon as possible and they had daily, weekly, and monthly chores from age 3 until they moved out. Nothing crazy, simple things at first (i.e. tidy your bedroom every night, pick up sticks during yard work, etc) until about 10 then they received more responsibility. The heavy stuff was left to me. I wasn't merciless, we took days off from time to time, we had lots of fun and I had a very good relationship with my older 5. They will joke occasionally about ""life in the trenches"" and dramatically reference a childhood memory but, these are done in humor with lots of laughing. Then there is my youngest, I will call her ""6"". I was not strict with 6 because she from a very early age was sensitive and had a terrible temper. As a baby she would throw horrendous fits that would require constant unbreaking attention to calm her down. Until she was about 4, she had similar rules when shopping as the older 5 did which included rules like: no touching glass or fragile items, no toys unless otherwise stated, stay by me and the cart, ask permission to go look at a specific item don't just run off. They aren't anything revolutionary. 6 could not abide by these rules. Consistent consequences did nothing for her either. The final straw in which I gave in and made her exempt to the rules was when she was about 4, we were in a shopping mall around christmas and 6 wanted a toy from a particular store. I said ""No"" and she went into a tirade, breaking several items, screaming at the top of her lungs, throwing punches at random people, trying to bite every one of her siblings and myself, and finally running away through the store while screaming and crying. I was chasing her as fast as I could through the store, my oldest running with me, and my second oldest watching the younger ones. Finally, security joined in after 6 ran up to an older woman and bit her to the point of drawing blood. We were asked to leave the store, 6's victim chose not to persue a case, and we went home. I told my her father about what happened, the older 5 were buzzing about it too. 6 cried on her bed for a couple hours before she was calm enough to talk to us, in which she told us she was embarrassed and didn't like us talking about her. So we never mentioned it. We did take her to a child psychologist who said I was too strict with 6 and needed to back off. So I did. I kept the older 5 in their routine but, 6 had no responsibility. She didn't even tidy up after herself because she would go into a fit when asked. She also got to pick out a treat for everyone when we went to the store. The treat picking was a sore spot for the older 5 who wanted turns picking out something as 6 didn't pick out things the family liked but rather, what she liked. So, gumballs, gummy bears, orange slices, and candy jewellery were what they usually got and they didn't like those being chocoholics. However, this kept 6 from exploding so, I allowed her to be the sole picker. Also, if I let the older 5 pick out something for themselves, 6 would wail the entire time until she went to bed, claiming that we hated her and didn't want to be her family. Inevitably the next morning she would wake up seeing red the whole day or until someone sacrificed themselves to be her ""friend"" (slave) all day. This was usually 5. Fast forward to 2010 and everyone but 5 and 6 are moved out. 5 gets accepted to an out of state college and moves. Then it was just 6, my husband, and me. All of the older 5 went to college and paid for it themselves. 5 went to college and ended up working 2 jobs to pay tuition. In 2015, 5 graduates and moves back home. 5 works 2 jobs, 1 in his field of choice and 1 part time job. 5 then buys a car. Now, in 2013, 6 decided to go to college. We paid for it because 6 refused to work due to social anxiety. 6 claimed that college would help her dip her feet in the pool and get used to social situations. 6 didn't have any non sibling friends growing up, she went to public school like the others but, never made friends due to her strong personality and inability to share or compromise so, she says this gave her social anxiety. 6 goes to 2 semesters worth of college before dropping out due to stress. So, 5 bought a car and moved out and this infuriated 6. She couldn't say one nice thing about 5 and ranted at the other 4 about 5 and claimed he was ashamed of the family and a pathological liar. This is not the case but, some of the siblings believed 6 because they weren't fully involved with 5 and hadn't talked to him since he graduated college so they thought he had changed. This resulted in 5 being left out of a lot of family parties and events. Which caused a huge argument when 5 showed up to an Easter party spitting fiery nails. The other 4 got angry with 6 for lying to them, my husband and I were angry because the other 5 had lied about inviting 5 to the get togethers. The family didn't talk for a couple of months. It was eventually sorted out but 6 has never apologized for her lies and the damage they did. In fact, when confronted she cried and wailed about killing herself. The family panicked about her suicidal threats. My husband and I took 6 to a therapist for 8 weeks and the therapist said we should help 6 get over her social anxiety with a car and monthly allowance and encourage her to go out and interact with people. We gave 6 my car because she would already run off to the gym and parks with it most days, a 2013 Chevy Equinox and budgeted $200 a month for her. She has no bills or obligations so it was easy for her to stick to the budget. When the older 5 found out about this, they were perturbed. They were frustrated with the college situation but a free car and money was admittedly excessive but, we just wanted her to get better. Another thing to mention is, 6 talks to her father and I like we're children and will frequently curse us out over things like, not having enough meat in the house or not having the house clean enough, etc.. this also makes the older 5 angry as this is disrespectful and not how they were raised. Anyway, in 2017, 5 came out as gay to the family while also announcing his engagement to his fiance, W. Before announcing this, he asked me if I thought 6 would handle it okay and I thought she would. She handled the other 4 getting married just fine. Well, I was wrong. 5 introduced W and everyone welcomed him with open arms except 6. 6 sulked the entire party, occasionally whining to the other 4 but mostly being ignored. Almost a year later, a little over a month before the wedding, 5 and W are at the house visiting us and helping my husband check the fit of his suit and my dress. We sit down to dinner and I called 6 up from the basement where she was playing video games and she ignored me so, we went ahead and ate after setting aside a plate of food for her. About an hour later, 6 storms up to the dining room and starts blaring curse word heavy rap. Lots of use of the n word, talks of very graphic sex acts, violence, etc. I know I am a stuffy old woman but, it was very crude. Her father and I asked her to turn it off which she did after we yelled at her. She then turned to W and began berating him for no reason. He has been nothing but kind, friendly, and loving to our family. She called him several names, including a few slurs, insinuated that he was inbred, accused him of attempting to kill our family, and compared him to fecal matter claiming that he was unwanted. 5 stood up for W immediately before 6 grabbed my butcher block of knives and stomped into the living room screaming about being neglected and overworked and carrying this family on her back. All of which is untrue. Her father and I went in to talk to her and calm her down to which she screamed about the horrible dinner she didn't want and that she wanted fast food so, her father took her to go get fast food while I tried to smooth things over with 5 and W. W was understandably confused but also upset. 5 was shaking in anger. But, they both remained calm and didn't really talk to me but instead kept exchanging angry glances. When my husband and 6 returned, 6 bounced into the dining room acting as if nothing happened at first until her father asked her what she thought of her behavior. She nonchalantly said to 5 and W that she was sorry, she was just ""hangry"" and that I should've made dinner earlier or stocked the house with the quick snacks she wanted to eat. She then said she wanted to play monopoly and asked 5 and W to join. It was very awkward silence before 6 asked 5 if they ""were good"" and then 5 calmly informed 6 she was uninvited from the wedding and unwelcome in their lives. 6 said this hurt her feelings. 5 said she wasn't worth any of his time. Admittedly, my husband and I handled that statement poorly and defended 6 by reminding him she is his sister and that's not how you talk to your family which only made things so much worse as we said nothing when 6 was berating and humiliating W. 5 and W left immediately without saying goodbye and we didn't hear from them until the rehearsal dinner when we were sat on the opposite end of the table away from the wedding party and other guests. Very much deserved. At the wedding, we were also informed that our role was going to be very scaled back. 5 refused to pin my boutonniere on and instead handed it to his father, we were not invited to stand up by them at the end, we were not allowed to verbally give our blessing, the officiant confirmed it for us, they gave us a gift, a beautiful framed hand embroidered tapestry of the family tree exactly like the one my grandmother had but was lost and a picture collage of my husband at various ages with his siblings, me at various ages with my siblings, our parents at various stages in life, our children at various ages and grandchildren and in the middle a huge family portrait with all of us. It actually made my husband cry and I bawled. So many favorite and incredible memories in those photographs all compiled into one place. I tried to give 5 and W a hug but, they were understandably cold and distant. My husband and I swore we were going to nip 6's behavior in the bud once and for all but, we didn't. We tried for several months but, she kept getting stronger and we gave up. In April of 2019, 6 got a job working at a warehouse owned by a friend of 3. She was making good money, roughly $1600 a month still with no bills or other obligations. She worked the night shift and even though it was located in a safe part of town, 6 declared she felt unsafe and asked to be moved to a day shift. They obliged, got her on her new schedule working 7am to 3pm and she quit a week later. She then got a job in June working at a grocery store as a cashier but was barely clearing $500 a month. But, she liked the hours because she only worked 10 to 15 hours a week. However, she wanted to get a new car and after her father and I said we couldn't afford a new car payment and her allowance she decided to get a better job. So in September she started working for a cleaning service owned by my friends daughter. She makes about $1100 a month and in October she purchased a 2020 Hyundai Sonata. And in October she also started dating an unemployed man I'll call ""DK"" who lived with his parents, is a former heroin and painkiller addict, smokes lots of marijuana, and has 2 kids with an ex girlfriend who is currently suing him for child support. 6 tried to trade in the Equinox, we stopped her because we were planning to give it to our oldest grandchild who is graduating college in May 2020. 6 decided to let DK use it for ""errands"". We protested, she went ballistic and damaged the Equinox. DK tried to reassure us that he would just be using the Equinox to go to court and nothing else. 6 wailed about DK being her soul mate and that we should help him. We said ""No"" and took both sets of keys and hid them. 6 was angry until November 8th, 2019 when my husband left for a 10 day business trip. Suddenly, she was very pleasant and even tried to help around the house. That night she fussed about not having a man in the house for 10 days. She said she felt scared and unsafe. Our town is small and hasn't had any crime in it besides things like neighbor disputes and recently a stolen wheelbarrow and ladder. The next night DK stayed over. And he stayed until November 19th, I went to pick up her father from the airport and told her DK needed to be gone by the time we got home. Roughly 90 minutes. We came home, DK was naked and high on something in the living room watching TV and 6 was tearing through our bedroom looking for the Equinox keys. We confronted her immediately and informed her that DK was absolutely not allowed to do drugs in our house at any time nor was he allowed to run around our home naked. She was actually quiet, ran down to DK had him get his undergarments on and they rushed up to her room only to appear 10 minutes later and rush out the door. My husband and I spent over an hour cleaning up our bedroom and cleaning up the trash and paraphernalia DK left. I called 1 and 2 to vent my frustrations. They said to kick her out, stop paying for her bills, and let her go. I tried explaining to them that I can't just abandon my child. They don't seem to see the fact that even though 6 is very difficult to live with she is still family and she is still my child and my responsibility. 5 and 6 do not talk anymore. 6 texts him frequently and he never responds unless it's something family related regarding a party or the like. Even then, he usually calls me or one of the other siblings for information and this infuriates 6. 6 and DK were gone for 2 days before they returned around 2 in the morning. We immediately told 6 that DK could not live here. She said ""Okay"" and went to her room. The next morning my husband and I had breakfast while DK bombarded us with his mindblowing historical facts which are honestly well known facts to anyone who hasn't fried their brain. 6 came down ready for work, I told DK to go grab his things and he asked ""Why?"" and I said that 6 was leaving so shes probably taking him home he said ""6 said I can stay here now."" My husband immediately got up from the table and told 6 that DK was not allowed to stay here and she said ""okay"" and ran out the door and took off. We called a cab for DK and he refused to get in repeatedly stating ""6 says I can stay here. She's an adult and this is her house too."" We reminded him every time that this is not 6's house to say who can move in and he claimed that we were abusing her. I have tried to research how it is we're abusing her but I have had no luck on Google. If anyone knows why this is considered abuse, please enlighten me. We had Thanksgiving and if he wasn't making out with 6, DK cornered everyone at some point, regardless of age, and went on a tangent about the war on drugs, marijuana's healing properties, why it needs to be legalized everywhere and a bunch of other wackadoodle ramblings. 1, 2, 4, and 5 all pulled their father and me aside to ask us what the flying hell is going on. 3 asked 6 how she managed to bag such a ""champion"". 6 didn't pick up on the cynicism and proceeded to talk about a dating app. When everyone was leaving they made remarks about ""the entertainment"" and 1 stated that if 6 and DK were at Christmas they weren't coming. Christmas ended up just being me, my husband, DK and 6. I sent a text to everyone wishing them all a Merry Christmas and told them that I really wish they were here and I received dozens of texts saying that all I had to do was get rid of 6 and DK. They do not understand what it is like with her. I know she is an adult, she's 26 years old but, she is still my child and I cannot morally dump my child on the streets and just walk away. I don't even know what the legal repercussions would be but, most likely not good. On New Years Eve, 6 got drunk or something and filmed a video on her cellphone telling off the whole family and bragging about what she can do without consequences. In it she particularly targets 5 and calls him several homosexual slurs and insults fiance. She sent it to 5 and 5 shared it with everyone else. She acted remorseful when we talked to her about it. But, last week 6 and DK sold the Equinox on craigslist for $4000. We are dealing with the legal issues regarding the sale but, we are trying to get the money from 6 and DK to put towards a car for our grandchild. The older 5 invited just me and their father to dinner and informed us that until we get rid of 6 and DK they want nothing to do with us. I am well aware that I am to blame for 6 and her behavior. I failed and because of that she is a failure. It is one of the reasons I can't just kick her out, she's like this because of me. I wasn't strict and consistent enough for her. I let her down and it's my job to clean up the mess I made. I don't want to lose my older children and I don't want to lose 6. I don't know what to do at all. Please before you give any judgement, I know that this situation I'm in is my fault. How can I fix it? Edit 1/18/2020: Last night around 1am I called a mental health services hotline that had been recommended to us by the last therapist we took 6 to see. I was given many options for mental health professionals for both my husband and I to visit. I have left a few voicemails requesting an appointment. Her father and I had a very long and exhausting discussion regarding our plan of action that basically involves kicking her out and cutting ties. As many of you already know, I am very stupid and this is difficult for me to process. My husband is more sane regarding 6, he was just following my lead as neither of us really knew what to do with 6. Monday we are scheduling a meeting with a lawyer to discuss all of our options pertaining to the car sale and the start of evicting 6 and DK. I still love her dearly and despite what it may appear I do deeply love my older children too. That being said, yes, I am an asshole and yes, the older 5 are absolutely better off without me in their lives. It has been made abundantly clear that I have lost all of them. I've known for a long while now deep down that my hopes for a proper relationship with 6 are dead, failure to remove the infection in the finger has led to the whole hand being amputated. Regarding the older 5, I am keeping them out of this, I am going to stay out of their lives unless invited back. I stumbled into motherhood and I thought I caught myself and was turning it into something more like a dance but, I have let maybe its pride or laziness I'm not sure blind me to the poison I was feeding my family. I knew something was going to give and I did nothing. All in all, I can say that 6 was the problem but in all reality and seriousness, it was me from the get go. Thank you for your comments and for calling me out. I appreciate the tough love and I appreciate those of you who have lived through something like this and allowed me to view the situation from the other side. I was looking for sympathy and validation, I believe I have received something better though it is shameful to admit I am such a failure I have heard that the first step healing is admitting you have a problem. I have a problem and I need help and I appreciate the help you have given. Thank you.",
897,"My daughter's dad has attempted suicide after an argument with her yesterday. She is 10 years old.She stays with him 2 times a week, has done since we split when she was around 2. Recently she lingers longer with me when she is supposed to be heading to stay with him, and yesterday she phoned me after being there for only about 3 hours asking could she come to see me for a while. I meet them and her dad states that as its 'his night' he expects her back in a few hours. Gets to the agreed time and she gets really upset about going back, I tell her it's ok if she wants to stay with me and she can see him the next day, but she says she feels bad about not going back to him. I try to explain that she shouldn't feel guilty etc and he calls her, proceeding to have a go at her for not coming back then hangs up. She is very upset by all this and not 5 mins later he is at my front door, screaming the odds and trying to push his way into my home, shouting at her to 'stop being a drama queen' and just get her stuff and go with him. She is shaking and crying at this stage and I ask him to leave as he's upsetting her. Argument between us ensues, his brother and father get out of the car and also verbally abuse me. I threaten to call the police and they leave. It took me 2 hours to calm her down after they left and reassure her that none of this is her fault. So now 24 hours later his father calls me to say he is in intensive care after overdosing last night. How do I tell my daughter? What if he doesn't make it? Sorry for the long post but I am totally at a loss here.",
898,"MIL expects me to quit my career to be her full time caretakerTW: mention of suicide So I’ve been lurking for a while and thinking my MIL must not be so bad despite a long history of weird behavior (like being sometimes possessive of me and crying to get what she wants... a story for another time). But she finally had a full-on, inarguable JNMIL moment. I’ve been with my husband for about a decade, essentially my entire adult life if you don’t count college. I’ve known his mother since before we were dating because we were good friends and I would come to his band’s shows and she would be there. She has always liked me, but it’s always been WAY over the top. My husband is not affectionate (even to me lol), so I think she tries to fill her emotional void with me. I also don’t have my own mother anymore, and she will tell anyone who will listen that she is basically a mother to me. Ok cool, on the surface, all nice stuff, above and beyond, yada yada. I’ve always felt lucky that she is like this, but also guilty because I find it insufferable to have to play a part in her narrative. That is, until about a month ago when we had a full-on JustNO experience. We (DH and me) were our to dinner with MIL, FIL, and MIL’s sister (DH’s aunt). Somehow, the conversation came around to how MIL and aunt are going to need help soon because they are getting older. They are not even 65, but they have led extremely unhealthy lifestyles and are prediabetic, cannot do most normal household things due to becoming out of breath, etc., but they always say that this is part of normal aging. I would argue that these might be symptoms of normal aging if you’re 90, but not early 60s. Anyways, this topic comes up, but we don’t immediately respond because we are exhausted after a decade of trying to help them make lifestyle changes. To be clear, we only offer advice at their request — a few times a year they’ll ask me if I can help them with their diet and come up with a beginner exercise plan. I digress... Well, our silence was broken by MIL cheerfully saying, “But I’m excited for that! Lowkeymcgee will quit her job and we will be able to spend so much time together! We can get a big house that all of us can live in! Won’t that be so fun?” No. It will not be fun. I said, “I’m absolutely not quitting my career. There are services you can pay for if you need full time care.” Of course, MIL says, “But it would be free if you could just take care of us!” My jaw DROPPED! That ain’t what free means! Luckily, DH snort laughs and says, “It won’t be free! It will cost us over 200k a year! And I don’t know what big house we’re buying if lowkeymcgee gives up her salary.” First, I’ve never felt so validated. It was the most amazing feeling. DH and I are different from many of our friends in relationships because I am the financial “provider”. I put that in quotes because I hate that it makes us sound unequal, when in reality we are building our empire together and share everything. For many reasons, we don’t share this info with most people, especially family. But damn it felt good to have him say it completely unashamed when it needed to be said. He’s amazing. Second, MIL was not happy with this response. She also didn’t believe it (“But you’re an engineer! I thought you made way more than her!”) She started pouting and then crying and dinner ended quickly. Her sister fed off of this and said, “Well I will just shoot myself since you’re too selfish to take care of me.” Are you kidding me? Wow. We left the restaurant and went our separate ways rather awkwardly, figuring things would blow over. Well, things haven’t blown over. MIL will bring the topic up and do her crying thing to make me feel bad. “I never thought my son and daughter would be ok with me being put in a home.” Wtf? I’m not your daughter. I had a mom, that’s over, and I’m not in the market for another one. That position is permanently filled, even if not physically. I don’t know how to deal with this situation. I am not good at being upfront with confrontation like this. I try to reason and say nice things to her to try to make her stop crying, which means my point totally gets lost. I also feel a lot of guilt because she has been mostly nice to me since meeting me, and I feel like I can’t tell her she’s not my mom because that feels so mean. AITA and just not realizing it? I would definitely appreciate any advice and even talking points for when this inevitably surfaces again.",

900,"I think my friend is suicidalSo I'm at work and have a friend/coworker who has been acting odd since they started this afternoon. They keep taking long bathroom breaks and seem visibly upset but aren't saying anything about it. I couldn't take it anymore when they spent 15 minutes in the bathroom and still wouldn't say anything. I told them they were clearly upset and I need to know what's going on. They silently clocked back in from there break and handed me a bunch of boxcutters, some with the blades loosened out and others still in the wrappers. I knew they'd been taking them home by mistake. They've also been wearing a big coat over their clothes all day. I'm freaking out and we both are working until close tonight. I really need someone to tell me what I should do right now.

901,"Three days after my friends brother’s funeral EM come and call friend suicidal and is the reason his brother did it.On mobile Engrish first language I dont give a single fuck about spelling or grammar. Yall should know who’s who and my friend didn’t speak to her at all during this and i didn’t pay attention to what he was saying to the kid. I personally didnt know who actually committed suicide but I knew his brother very well. 3 days after the funeral, a lady and a child walk past our little boy scout popcorn stand that we had set up. Note: This was about a week before I was 18 and was already an Eagle Scout while my friend was still a life scout(being the one who lost his bro). The kid was someone my friend teaches at a church bible study class so they get to talking while I am just watching. Mid conversation the Mom gasps, walks over to the kid, grabs his arm and yells in my friends face. EM: You stay the fuck away from my child you suicidal freak!!! I was shocked and before my friend could say anything she continued. EM: You need to leave here and stop being a bad influence to everyone and influencing my son and him(pointing to me) To kill themself just like your brother!! You probably told him to do it!! I. FUCKING. SNAPPED. ME: YOU CAN FUCK RIGHT OFF AND NEVER TALK TO US AGAIN. HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU TALK TO HIM LIKE THAT. HE JUST LOST HOS DAMN BROTHER YOU UNFEELING WHORE. GET THAT KIM KARDASIAN LOOKING ASS OUT OF OUR FACE!!! EM: HOW DARE- I cut her off ME: YOU DONT GET TO SAY ANOTHER DAMN WORD!!! GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM US OR I WILL CALL THE COPS! She the proceeds to slap me hard across the face. My friend after hearing this stood up( he is 6’ 8”) and then while i call the cops chokes her until she passes out. Cops get there they review the footage on cameras and she gets a free cop car ride. I don’t give a fuck what happens to her. Ot all ended well and the cops bought our entire stock of popcorn.",

903,"My friend is suicidal... what do I do?Hey, I made a friend in school who’s extremely suicidal. I’ve known him three weeks and he’s talked to me a lot about how he’s depressed and doesn’t want to live. I’ve, of course, been extremely concerned and tried to help but there’s nothing I can really do. He’s in therapy, and has been sent to the hospital multiple times (not for attempting, but for cutting and thoughts of suicide) so I don’t really know what I can do. He seems really happy sometimes and he’s had depression for years so I’ve just kind of hoped it’d be okay, but I’m worried. He’s trans, and his grandma’s supportive but his grandpa isn’t (he lives with his grandma and grandpa). He messaged me again tonight and said how he’s been genuinely considering it and I should forget him. I’ve sent long messages about how he’s important and so many people care about him and he doesn’t really respond to that he just says something else about how he doesn’t matter. I get that what I’m saying isn’t helping and that he’s upset but I don’t even know what to say anymore. I’ve tried just listening, but at this point I feel like that’s not enough. I want to talk to a hotline or something, but like I said earlier he’s been to a hospital and it hasn’t helped. What do I do?",
904,"My friend is suicidal and I don’t think anything can help her. Hi all. I am a 17 y/o and the person this post about is 16 and has diagnosed anxiety and (?) maybe depression. So, we are currently in secondary school during a somewhat stressful school year. I had noticed that my friend had been acting up lately in the recent week or two; staring off into the distance, not saying a word to anyone in the friendgroup, and so on. I thought this was weird but decided not to ask as her text messages to me outside of school were fine, and she never acted this way when it was just her and I.. Though, after a while, her texts were slightly more complacent and etc. At this point, I was having slight suspicions though I didn’t want to assume anything.. Then she told her maths teacher about her anxiety issues coming back (note that he was her teacher from previous years and had known about her anxiety..) so he began to take her out of class, talk to her after class, and etc. A few of my friends thought it was super inappropriate and weird for a 16 y/o girl to be alone with a 40+ year old man who was skipping his own classes to talk to her and help her with her anxiety; but we all stayed quiet. One day at school, she left early and texted me; she wanted to commit suicide (not her first time apparently) and of course, I was shocked, hurt, confused, etc. In fact, I was in such a state of shock that I had to share the news onto ONE trustworthy friend and he helped me message her to convince her to not take her life.. Since then, she’s been missing a lot of class.. The teacher who helps her with her anxiety has sent her to in-school counselling (He does NOT know about the suicidal urge she had) and she often leans on this weird line between me telling him and me not telling him? As in, she’d text me something similar to, “By the way, if you want to tell Mr (teacher) about my suicidal thoughts, you can but just say it’s a theory.. You don’t have to if you don’t want to.” I want to tell our designated liaison person about this and she isn’t actually aware of that.. It’s getting too stressing and she keeps talking about how she has no motivation to do anything, go to school, etc. The only problem is that I wont be in much next week due to appointments so I’m scared I won’t be there if something happens. Also, when someone is at a risk of killing themselves or hurting others/etc where I’m from, they are basically banned from going to school until provided with a doctors’ note saying that they are safe to come back (I dunno if this is different in other places). My biggest fear is that if I report her issue to the designated liaison person, she will be banned and well, it’s way safer for her to be at school than home alone… She won’t listen to me when I talk to her about getting help; she claims that it won’t work and that she can’t find any reason to live even though she’s so young and impressionable! I’m really trying not to be naive but in general, I’m really bad at dealing with other people’s problems. This whole thing was sort of forced onto me and I’m starting to genuinely lose my mind.. What should I do? Should I tell the designated liaison person and risk her being home alone? Should I just suffer in silence? What can I genuinely do?",
905,"My friend is suicidal, please helpI've been trying to help my friend with mental issues for about a year now, I managed to get her to stop cutting for about 6 months and things were looking up until about a month ago.

I'm the only person she's told this much information to, including other friends, counselors, parents, etc. About a month ago she started cutting again, not regularly but every 2 weeks or so. I'm frustrated that she hides from her problems and tries to ignore them, relying on outside help. Yesterday I made a bad decision and I reached out to one of her previous bullies to try and understand what happened. I didn't gain any information from the bully, the only real result was that she got angry, had a panic attack, and refused to talk to me.

I'm frustrated that she hides from her problems and tries to ignore them, relying of outside help. Yesterday I made a bad decision and I reached out to one of her previous bullies to try and understand what happened. I didn't gain any information from the bully, the only real result was that she got angry, had a panic attack, and refused to talk to me. I didn't learn until today that she tried to kill herself twice last night. She resumed talking to me today, but she's still angry and I know that I've broken her trust. I don't know what to do and I'm afraid I'm going to make things worse, I'm talking to a counselor tomorrow but in the meantime, I want to hear what Reddit thinks. Any advice is appreciated, I really just don't know what to do.",
908,"YSK: Active Listening, a technique developed by the Samaritans to help people to talk through difficult subjects.**Active listening may be the most important skills you ever learn.** The Samaritans (a UK-based mental health charity) developed it to talk down suicidal people, but you can use it for *any* situation where you feel like a friend needs to get something off their chest. Some friends have said that I always know how to help them, when the truth was, all they needed was to vent. I'm not a professional so please don't think of me as an expert - please consult the Samaritan's [guide] (http://www.samaritans.org/active-listening) to their technique first and foremost. When someone tries to open up to you, sometimes the first instinct is to be **passive**. You care about what they're saying, so you just wait for them to speak and tell you about it. For some people, that'll work. But for some people, *if you don't react they'll think you're not interested.* The other extreme is *to contribute too much.* In your panic to help, out of your mouth comes ""That's awful what are you going to do my sister's great aunt killed herself but you're better than that"" Active listening tries to find the *happy medium* between these two options. This technique is about making someone feel important, like you want to hear what they're saying. In order to do that, here are some basics - please please if you're interested do some of your own research, as it will make you internalise the technique. *First, use ""w"" words.* What made you think that/why did you do that/ how did that make you feel/when did you start feeling this way/ who made you feel worst. It's their story. To encourage them to tell it to you, rephrase their statements. **Parrot.** If someone tells you ""5 years ago I was bullied constantly. Now I can't seem to move on""; there are two strands of that sentence they want to talk about. What the bullying meant for them, and why they can't seem to forget it. To tease those strands, answer with, *""How were you bullied?""* *""Why can't you move on?""* Make the noises You know the ones. *Mhmm, Yes, I see*. If they're on a roll, don't slow them down by making them think you're not interested. Similarly, focus on their every word. You are their audience, you care about them so by god **you will keep eye contact even if it kills you.** Using your best judgement, *insert your own story.* This is totally situation dependent. You will know if they want to rant or if they don't know how to express it. If they want to rant, encourage them with the handy tips above or suggested by the Samaritans' [website] (http://www.samaritans.org/active-listening) (seriously, check that thing out!). If they're afraid of how to phrase it, *use a personal story and immediately bounce it back to them.* Think of it as tennis. If they smash the ball to you, hit it straight back. They've got the **confidence** they need. If they weakly lob it to you, send it back with your *own spin* on it. ""My brother was also bullied, he confided in me. Did you confide with anyone until now?"" *Make them think you care.* Sometimes it's a hugely emotional situation and the above tips will never be as useful as a big hug. Hugs are incredible. If you need my hugging advice, *first of all you may need help.* But my advice would be to **hug from the shoulders not the arms,** and be comforting without being stifling. Remember each person is different so the way you talk to people should depend on your personal knowledge of them - if you call someone a pet name, use it. If the person has a more logical turn of mind, *gingerly* steer the conversation towards what you think is a logical solution. If all they need is to vent without judgement, **do not offer advice!!** Memorise your local suicide hotline. Trust me on this, the professionals should **always** be consulted if the person you're talking to is willing to chat to them. *You are not a substitute for a professional.* 'Nuff said. **DESIRE, METHOD, DATE.** If someone is suicidal, use this method to establish the threat they pose to themself. If they want to die, they know how to die, and they know when to die, *take immediate action.* Even *just one or two* of these factors could lead to someone being pushed over the edge by life events and instantly deciding to commit. This is important. **IF SOMEONE IS CONFIDING IN YOU NEVER DISMISS IT.** Even a joke can be a cry for help so never discount worrying information based on the *tone* it's said in. It's a positive thing if someone wants to confide in you. They care about you enough to share a difficult part of their life. Congratulations if you are confided in, and good luck. Check out /r/kindvoice if you want someone to listen right now. **If you are reading this and think you may need help, you don't have to go through it alone. Here are some hotlines.** Childline : www.childline.org.uk 0800 1111 The Samaritans: www.samaritans.org 116123 American Suicide Prevention website https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org and hotline 919-231-4525 More lines can be found here, for your calling pleasure https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines EDIT: there are definitely some mistakes I've made in this post, and I've been happy to admit them in comments. For one of my examples I included *why* which has been avoided by many organisations because it sounds accusing. **Why** also lends itself more to a closed question than an open question, and open questions is the other part of active listening that I neglected. Framing your question so your personal views or judgements don't effect their answer is important, y'all. The other mistake I made, which no-one has picked up on afaik, is that the Samaritans didn't invent Active Listening. [According to wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_listening#History) > Carl Rogers and Richard Farson coined the term ""active listening"" in 1957 in a paper of the same title. Finally, people have mentioned that prolongued eye contact/ using noises such as *Mhmm* could lead to discomfort or irritation. I totally agree, but I myself am only recently learning to use **any** eye contact in conversation. I'm prone to being a passive listener, so that is why I recommended using these social cues a little bit more. The point of this post was to inform and help people, and I hope it encouraged some of you to do your own research.",
909,"Just found out my friend is suicidal through their family member. Should I give some space or should I immediately try to contact them?To clarify, I've had friends who were suicidal in the past, but in those instances they either told me immediately or I found out long after the fact so I felt like I had more of an opening/invitation to talk to them about it. However, this is possibly my oldest and closest friend. We've talked about depression before and mental health and I would think this is something he would know he could talk to me about. It's the fact that he didn't, and also that I was fairly caught off guard in hearing he was being taken to the hospital to talk to someone that has me unsure of how to approach it. Should I try to go see him directly, should I text him? I've dealt with a friend in this situation before so as far as the actual conversation goes it's something im prepared for, its just this time around im worried about being intrusive. And the thing is, I don't think he'd bring it up at this point, so I don't want to just ignore it and act like everything's fine. Thankfully he has a girlfriend whose extremely caring and the moment he told her she talked him into immediately going to speak to someone. Any advice or even a shared experience would be appreciated right now. Thanks.",
910,"My friend is suicidal again, and I'm refusing to helpI just can't anymore. Six years I've been her friend and I went through a year and a half of this before she even thought about trying to get better. Shes suicidal and not afraid to attempt but I have nothing left to give. I mean, I say that but... there's always something left. I just am refusing this time, and I feel like shit about it. I know I'm being selfish but I know if I try to help its going to make my life miserable like it did the last time. So I'm done. I'm done trying to talk her down. I'm done being the guy that's pulled her off of ledges and knives away from her wrists. I'm done being the guy that's always there no matter how much she hates herself. I'm done being the guy that always has to reassure her because her view of reality is so warped she's her own worst enemy. And I'm done being the thing for her to lash out at. I'm done being yelled at and told I'm not caring enough because she's too insecure to see that I do. I'm done walking on eggshells about every single thing that I say and creating phrasing that cannot possibly be turned into a sleight against her. I'm done and I feel great and horrible about it. I'm the worst best friend. But I don't have the emotional capacity to do this anymore. From now on, she's getting met with indifference and direction to talk to a professional.",
911,My friend is suicidalMy friend keeps leaving our discord saying we all secretly hate him and aren't real friends. A new person joined yesterday and called him cringe and I think that pushed him over the edge and he changed his name to 'im gonna kill myself' on Twitter. We managed to get a message back from a DM and he said it's not a joke. I want to call the police and help him but I hear that can also make things worse. It's hard to get in touch with him and I just don't know what to do,
912,"I think my friend is suicidal but I don’t know how to help him, he keeps distancing himself from me.My friend and I are in our early 20s. We’ve been basically best friends since 9th grade. My friend’s recently gone through a lot of shit. His dad died in 2018 unexpectedly, the anniversary of his death this year kind of coincided with when we kind of fell out of touch. From what I had heard from other friends he wasn’t doing too well about it but I never reached out to him, I didn’t know what to say or do. Then at the beginning of January, his long time girlfriend moved across the country, he drove with them to say goodbye and then flew back. When he got back I figured now would be a good time to get back into touch with him. I texted him asking him how his trip was. He didn’t respond until 3 days later, just saying “garbage”. I told him I knew how tough it must be for him and whatnot, and we actually had a decent conversation. We hadn’t talked in a few months so we kind of caught up with each other. He said he quit his job and is just working at the grocery store now, I asked him about his cars (we are car guys) and he said he hasn’t touched them since he left his job. But then once I asked him to hang out he just stopped. I texted him again multiple times throughout the next, like, 2 weeks and nothing. I was talking to another one of my friends, who can admittedly be a dick sometimes, who was saying “oh he’s totally gonna kill himself”. I just want to know if there’s anything more I can do? We were best friends but we fell out of touch for a bit but I didn’t think we aren’t friends anymore, and now that I’m trying to reconnect with him since he’s going through a tough time he won’t even answer me anymore.",

Even though she is not diagnosed yet her therapist said there was a high chance she is. I don’t know what to do because I can’t simply go to her house and comfort her. We are miles away from each other. She seems extremely hopeless and I’ve tried everything ti cheer her up and talk to her. Comfort her. Everything. I’m scared. I don’t know how to help her.

917,"My Friend Is Suicidal/Willing to Harm, and I Don't Know How to HelpHi all! I'm a streamer using an alt account. My earliest sub/longest viewer/channel VIP (basically he's been with me since the beginning) occasionally hits up my Discord privately to let me know he's feeling really down, and normally we can have a chat about it and things improve over time. Today, though, he asked me a direct question about how a streamer/the community (of the type of gaming we both do) would react to the suicide of someone. I would really like to help, but I don't know how. I have reminded him that he can blow up my DMs any time he wants (that's what my Discord is for), and that I thought that the community at large would want to be supportive of someone if they knew they felt this way and would want to help them to be happy. The problem is that he is in (I believe) Finland, and I'm in the US. I linked him both the phone numbers and website that I could find for that country's suicide help service, but is there any more that I can do? In the end, I understand this is not my problem to ""fix,"" but I do want to try to help in the capacity that I am able to.",
918,"My friend is suicidal and I don't know how to actI'm a guy in my 20's and I have a younger female friend who I met through a common hobby about a year ago. We are not that close but for some reason she decided to open up to me about her depression and suicidal thoughts about 5 months ago. She is into me romantically, but I don't see her that way and I have told her that. Occasionally she writes to me about being sad and not wanting to go on living ect. I don't mind hearing her out and giving her advice, because I know how much it means to have someone to talk to, I've been there myself. At the same time I am afraid that the more she talks to me, the more she becomes dependent on me and my soothing, especially considering she is attracted to me. She has tried getting professional help from multiple psychiatrists and even spent a couple of weeks in an institution under constant supervision. She says nothing has improved and it's getting worse. So far she has not harmed herself but I'm really scared for her. That all takes us to last night - she messages me at 1am saying she should not be in this world anymore, then deletes the message and goes dark. Doesn't answer messages or her phone. I panic, look up her family members phone numbers from the internet, mom, dad, sister. No one answers, I panic even harder and consider driving to her family's house to check up on her. Finally it's about 2 am when her dad picks up and is really confused about my call. I introduce myself and apologize for calling so late and ask him to check on her daughter for me, also tell him I received a worrying message. Thankfully she is sound asleep and everything is alright. The dad had woken her up to tell her about my call. I call her and we talk for an hour about how stupid her course of action was and that she should never do that again. She promises me to always contact me and talk it over before she does anything to herself. And now here I am, stressed as fuck about someone I don't really even know. Am I overreacting? Should I just ignore these kinds of messages? I DO NOT want to live for the rest of my life knowing that something happened to her and I could have stopped it if I had just listened. She chose me to open up to, I can't change that anymore. What should I do? How can I help her? How should I go about communicating with her? Should I go if she want's to meet up? Will it just make it worse? Please, someone, tell me what to do.",

920,"[TW: suicide] My friend is suicidal and I feel like I can't help her anymore. I have a friend who's very dear to me, she's younger so I see her as some sort of baby figure. She's 16 and, overall, she is a great friends, very funny, a great writer for her age. She likes to dance, and we met through a shared interest, which she's very invested in. But it's been a year since she's started to feel very suicidal. She's constantly having anxiety attacks and whenever she tweets about them, I text her privately and try to help her through it. She attempted suicide at least 3 times this year and I couldn't do much about it except worry and pray that she's ok. Now her tweets about suicide have been increasing a lot, and everything becomes a self-esteem trigger for her, even when we try to help her. She's going to the gym, having psychological treatment (although she didn't went to a psychiatrist yet) and still her mental health has never been more self destructive. I know its been infinitely harder for her to go through this than it is for me to show support, but at this point I feel like it's only a matter of time till she's never online again and I'm gonna have to deal with the fact that my dearest friend ended her own life. It scares me, because I love her and I believe so much in her future but there's no way to make her believe my words. Anyways I'm just venting this right here because I don't want her to think I gave up on her.

I need advice about what I should do to help him, I'll leave detailed information about the situation. He has been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and OCD. His OCD is really bad and that is the main thing driving him towards this decision. In his mind he always has to do everything right and if he wasn't able to succeed in it at first, he goes back and redoes it until he succeeds in whatever he is trying to accomplish. We graduated high school in May and he had two dreams for high school: make it the best he possibly could and to have a girlfriend throughout it (he has never had a girlfriend before). He started a business in high school and started focusing on that, which took away time from him accomplishing his dreams. We ended up graduating and he was not able to accomplish these dreams and now he is obsessing over them, not being able to fix them. There was a time where a girl that he had liked also liked him and tried pursuing him, but he was obsessing over his business at the time and he didn't focus on her and now she is with someone else. He really likes this girl now and has for a very long time now and now when he sees her with her boyfriend, he wants to throw up and cry (her and the boyfriend have been together for over a year or so and have no signs of breaking up, at least any time soon). He has all of this regret on top of him and he feels since he can not fix these mistakes, there is only one thing he can do to make this pain go away, which is suicide. He is currently taking medicine for his depression, anxiety and OCD, and it works and he gets random spurts of happiness, but he still always feels the depression. He also thinks death isn't bad and has come to terms with dying, he thinks it's okay for him to go anytime now. He claims he doesn't know how much longer he has left and if he isn't able to get with this girl anytime soon, he will probably end his life. I've tried getting him with other girls but he does not care for anyone else, he only wants this one girl. Also, he is already seeing a therapist but it is not helping him.

(for example he says that his parents are angry and telling him that he is a failure in life, but whenever the topic is about grades the parents show interest and act nicely) I’ve told him to talk to his parents but he is really stubborn about that and says that they wont care.

It was really sudden for him since they seemed to get along to perfectly. The next day he came into school crying. I just held him and tried to comfort him the best I could whilst no one else seemed to care. He deteriorated day by day. He was trying to hide his sadness from everyone for their benefit not his. His mom sold his dog so they could get extra money and after this he tells me that his last piece of happiness had crumbled away in an instant. I try to comfort him the best I can every second of every day but I just feel helpless. We had 2 weeks of school recently and when we came back he told me that he was feeling really suicidal and that he hasn't slept since his dad left and that he's only eating 1 meal a day because of his stress. I'm just so terrified of losing him because I don't want to live in a world without my best friend. His mom has booked a counselling for him so hopefully that will help a little but I feel that I need to do more before he does anything stupid. Please help me asap.,

931,"My friend is suicidal and I don't know how to help herI am having a rough patch myself and I do everything I can to help her. But it's extremely draining and triggering for me to constantly talk her down. I have her stay at my house even though it can be slightly detrimental to my own mental health because I know I need quite a bit of alone time to recharge. I feel selfish for feeling this way because she would help me in my time of need. I don't want to make her check herself in because she doesn't have health insurance and doesn't have the funds to pay for a stay in the hospital. What can I say to her that will help? I don't really feel trained for this, but I know she doesn't have the money for therapy or anything like that. I listen to her, and try to reword and repeat what she's saying. I tell her to find positive coping mechanisms, I tell her to find something she's grateful for and to think about how much she will be missing out on if she kills herself. Am I doing this all wrong? It doesn't seem to help much in the moment...",
932,"My dog died yesterday. I think my friend is suicidal and jealous. I don't know how to respondMy 15yo dog that I was very attached to due to my social isolation had to be euthanized yesterday. I was very lucky to have a good friend Mike who came to the hospital with me and has been of tremendous emotional support. However, Paul, who lives overseas, has been posting suicidal art lately. Our friendship has been very strained the past several months because I have lost patience with his self-destructive poor decision making and emotions. He says I've been a shitty, unsupportive friend. When I told him about my dog passing away and Mike's help, Paul said _""it seems like your needs are taken care of elsewhere""_, clearly a jealous message. I know he's in a bad place right now, I can tell by the way he's talking. But i genuinely do not know how to respond to that message. I want to empathize and comfort him but I'm also exhausted from doing that constantly in our friendship, and also from my grief. Any thoughts is much appreciated, thank you",

935,"My friend is suicidal/rantHonestly, I just wanted to get this out somewhere and not just written on a piece of paper in a book that nobody will read. I dont know who is going to read this but thank you if you do. I am 17 years old and so is my friend (we've been friends for 6 years), I have suffered from depression (and some suicidal thoughts here and there) for a while on and off this whole year and have been really suicidal on two occasions but this is nothing compared to my friend. My friend lets call her D, told me in one of our talks about how we were feeling (we've been talking about our mental problems for the past 5 months) that she's been depressed for about 2 years. Her home life is pretty stable except for the fact that recently this year her mother was hospitalized and I don't know the details of her medical condition but also in the past months her grandpa suffered a stroke and is paralyzed and they're also struggling a bit financially. At school, we aren't enrolled in normal schooling but we're in IB instead (if you know what that is great but in simple words its university but in highschool). IB had always been hard for us, in the beginning especially for me as I also have ADHD, but she was ok, she was able to do her work and she was pretty good at pretending to be ok too. Because we began talking, we ended up becoming each other's primary person to go to, to talk and rant and just let it out. And honestly I love that, I love how much trust and faith we have in each other and I would trade for anything in the world. The past few months D has slowly opened up to our 4 friends in our friend group and made it clear that she is struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts as well as self-harm. I took pride in knowing these things beforehand and being the person she would confide in. But honestly, its become too much I've realized from D last 3 failed suicide attempts and from her 4th suicide attempt this Monday at school which got the school involved so now all our teachers know, as well as her family (she had already told her mom before and was on antidepressants after going to the doctor with her mom like 3 weeks ago). This only resulted in a trip to the ER and being given more antidepressants, it did nothing to the many overdue assignments she had from the past months and her family's situation. In our recent talks, she made it clear to me that she thinks that I am the only one that cares (I don't think that's true), and it's only because of me that she's been alive for so long. This made me so happy but also made me realize something. I don't know if I am being selfish for thinking this or shallow-minded, but I realized that even after being told what is going in D's life none of my other friends made any extra help, like they offered her support with school and listened to her. But every time something would happen the answer that they always came up was that I had to do something about it. It's as if all of my other friends are relying on me to keep D alive as they'll help with small things like helping complete her schoolwork but its primarily my job to be the sole caretaker and keep her alive, and it just breaks me. Because I know that I can't say anything no, or give up or back away from this situation for a second to take a breather to get my self together because if I do any of those things I won't have a friend tomorrow. But I am not ok, and I know it, I've started self-harming again, I'm getting nightmares too, I feel emotionally numb almost all the time unless D needs me then I try my utmost to help her. Thing is I don't want to give up on her or back away from the situation I just wish my other friends would realize what they're actions are doing to me and that just because I seem like I have the most control in this situation and that I'm calm and find quick solutions under pressure doesn't mean that I am ok. And I'm not saying they're bad friends, I just wish somebody cared as much as I did so I wouldn't be in a fight or flight mode all the time just waiting to get that one bad phone call or text message telling me that hey "" D has committed suicide""",

I struggle with mental health quite a bit but as of late I have been improving with small steps. My friend however, I’ll call her B, she’s been battling mental health for most of her life(she’s 19). We go to separate universities so I don’t see her as much as I’d like but we keep in touch. I was talking to her tonight and she was explaining how low she feels and how the waiting list she’s on for counselling is just over 20 weeks long. She feels hopeless and just wants to end it all. And I’m terrified. On one hand I want to beg her to not do it, that she’ll hurt so many of the people around her that care about her but on the other, I know it’s hard and I don’t want to be selfish and make her love every day suffering just so I don’t have to deal with her loss.

940,"My friend is suicidal and I don’t know how to helpMy friend has had two attempted suicides in the past 6 years and is only 18 years old. He recently moved out of his parents house to a place he doesn’t know to be closer to the girl he loves. They aren’t together but he feels really seriously about her. The problem is he doesn’t have a car or his license and the city he moved to doesn’t have reliable transportation. She’s the only person he knows. He’s working two minimum wage jobs to cover living expenses and rent and is biking walking to work. Recently his housing situation fell completely through and he won’t have anywhere to live after this month. He can’t find any apartments within his price range near where he works. The girls parents are super strict and won’t let him stay with them. None of her friends are still home as they have went away for school and she has no other family in the area to try and help him out. He left his parents because he said the environment was too toxic and wasn’t fixable. He said he felt suicidal living at home and in his hometown and felt like he needed to get away. He refuses to consider moving back home at all. My issue with this is that if he moved back in with his parents, he could learn to drive, save money, attend school, have people he knows be around him. And although this isn’t his ideal situation at least he could get back on his feet and get a head start at saving up money for the next time he moves out. I don’t fully understand he extent of his issues with his parents, but he says they’re terrible. Lately with all this happening, he has talked about hanging himself , giving up, says he can’t be alive if his life isn’t progressing. I feel helpless and I don’t know what the fuck to do.",

945,"My friend is suicidal and it’s scary and exhaustingSo my friend has been depressed for more than a couple years now, ever since her mon died. She still lives at home, her family is uncommunicative with each other to a crazy extent, and her job situation could be better. I found out last night that she’s actually more depressed than I thought, the big shock last night was that apparently this last winter she was not only suicidal but had a thought-through plan. Her affect is always pretty blunt and it can be hard to read how bad she’s feeling on a given day, so I’m not 100% sure how bad things are with her at the moment, but she spent like big stretches of the night for example not talking at all. I’ve been trying to help her with referrals to therapy but the wait time everywhere she’s asked is like four months. I asked her last night if she felt like she needed to go the hospital, and asked her to call me or another specific close friend of hers ASAP if she started feeling dramatically worse. She got herself home okay, but I felt bad leaving her alone at all, and I am fucking furious about how big the obstacles are to professional help.

There have been multiple times where he has thought about suicide, the other day he told me that he was close to drinking bleach and that he wants it all to end.

950,"My friend is suicidal. I need help.UPDATE: if anybody ever even reads this, it was all just a ploy for attention. she and i had a falling out, and we may have lost our friendship over this. right now, I’m feeling okay. I feel kind of like I lost something that I needed to. Long post ahead. TLDR at bottom. Apologies in advance, my thoughts are very jumbled and this may be a bit confusing. I do not know how to handle any of this right now and I feel like a bad friend. One of my friends is going through a breakup. It’s been a long time coming, but it was made official last week. Today I finally agreed to go hang out with her, I’ve been busy with work and haven’t had a lot of time to spend with her. But she likes to try to guilt me into it by saying she’s suicidal and she “needs me and only me”. Now, I’ve known her for about 8 years, and I’ve known her now ex for about 7 years. I’ve also seen her go through three other breakups and she has never acted like this. She has a very young child (3 yo) and claims she’s abusing prescription meds and alcohol, and has been asking for marijuana. We live in a non-legalized state and it’s hard to find if you don’t know who to ask. She thinks I am single handedly going to be her saving grace, I’m going to magically make her better and get her marijuana and personally, I want out. But i’ve agreed to see her tonight, but here’s what I’m worried about... She’s got a very addictive personality, if she’s already abusing her meds and alcohol, weed isn’t going to make that end. I’m worried for a time when it’s not strong enough for her anymore and she seeks something worse. Also, if she is really suicidal, she is being selfish by not thinking of her child. I’m honestly freaking out because I don’t want to let her think she can manipulate me into dropping my life for her because honestly, I’m not 100% positive that she’s even doing the things she claims. I really believe it’s a ploy to guilt me. So here’s where I need help: I’ll be able to read her better once I see her, and see if she’s truly as bad off as she says or if she’s bluffing. But what do I do in either scenario?! Or, do I just not go in the first place and handle it another way? TLDR: Friend claims she’s suicidal and abusing drugs. She thinks I can magically make it all better. Am I a bad friend for not wanting anything to do with her? If she is suicidal what do I do?",

I’ve seen her with scratches on her arms and she’s clearly not in a good place. Sometimes she walks carelessly out by the road as well. One of her dogs died in the past year and that was very sudden and upsetting to her as well. I’ve talked to her a couple of times about seeing a therapist, and she always said seeing one would make her feel like she’s “broken and needs to be fixed.” I’m really worried that one day I’ll find out that she killed herself. Should I find a way to talk to her parents and tell them that they need to get her some serious help? Should I try and talk to her again? Do I tell my mom and have her talk to my friend’s parents? Can her parents make her go to the hospital? UPDATE: I told my mom, and now we’re working together with my friends mom to try and talk to my friend and see if there’s anything we can do to help. It’s such a relief to know that I’m doing everything in my power to help her, and that her parents aren’t just sitting around twiddling their thumbs.

He drank a lot before I already was there and then he asked me to come with him, after which we talked for over and hour. &#x200B; He was only able to tell me since he was drunk and here's his story: He was born into a VERY rich family. This meant that he never had to work for anything since he got everything from his parents and grandparents. At some point in his childhood his parents divorced VERY violently. His grandfather from his mothers side has even gone as far as to sue his father, for reasons that I don't know. His father lost the lawsuit iirc and since then he has been a bit disconnected from the world, and started drinking heavily. He grew up in a small village, and he never had any friends the same age as him, not until a few years ago when he got into my class. He got bullied from first to 6th grade, and this left heavy psychological damage to him. His brother is a few years older than him, and a few years ago he started only living with his father. My friend however is at his fathers place like 40% of the time. Well, now he is in my class, most of us like him and I don't know anyone who holds a personal grudge against him. He however thinks, that most people hate him. I tried really hard to convince him that this isn't the case, but he doesn't believe me. He said that he doesn't care about anything except what other people think about him. Since he thinks everyone hates him, he hates himself as well I guess. After some talking he also told me that he thinks he would like to kill someone, however he won't do it since he doesn't want to face the consequences. The only people he really cares about are his grandma, his grandpa and his brother, and his grandfather passed away a month ago, since then I noticed that something changed in him. I already conviced him to tell his mother about this, but I'm not sure if he'll do it. I woulld however call a therapist myself if he doesn't do it, I think he would accept the help if he doesn't have to get it himself.

961,"My friend is suicidal, and obsessive. I have no clue what to do.Hello, I have a friend who i play videogames with very often. A while ago he told me he liked me, and i had no problem with that, though i’m not a very commitment oriented person (unlike him i think) Then a few months ago he told me he loves me and he was feeling a little sad, then sadness very quickly spiraled into a dark depression. I asked him why/when he thinks it started and he just simply said “the day i met you”. *At this point we were talking literally everyday. *ALSO* our situation is very odd we met over an online game and he’s kinda a loner and he would text me a lot over playstation (like almost a year 1/2 ago when we met) and then eventually i gave him my snapchat. He’s about year younger than me so i thought maybe it was just a harmless crush. We’re not adults, and he said to me he wants to marry me. I care about him wholeheartedly and love him as a friend he is really smart but now he’s stopped going to school. I know some of his friends but he doesn’t tell them anything about his depression and no one really knows except for me and i’m five states away from him btw. He told me he went to the doctor with his parents and his doctor recommended him a psychiatrist. He then proceeded to tell me he has severe anxiety about the doctors finding out where his depression stemmed from. At this point i am so lost and emotionally drained from this boy. I’ve considered just cutting him off (and i’ve tried) numerous times but then his one OTHER friend(2) that actually lives near him will text me saying that friend 1 is trying to kill himself and he needs me. My personal life is falling apart and my own depression and anger is getting worse. This kid keeps me up UNTIL 4:30 AM!!!! He gets immensely worse when i do fall asleep on him. I take multiple medications because of my own mental health issues. One being Seroquel (i forget what the actual name is but that’s the brand) and that’s supposed to help me calm myself when off them i usually can’t. So when i take them before bed they are supposed to calm me for sleep and i’ve had only 4 hours of sleep in the past week. I have a life outside of my phone and my game console and him. I’ve stopped eating. It’s hard to get out of bed in the morning. I feel i am losing my mind. He’s cut himself and has tried to OD but he threw the pills up. He tells me he trembles and shakes when i hang up. He pukes all the time when i’m on the phone with him. And he cries ALL. THE. TIME. I HAVE ENOUGH GODDAMN FUCKING PROBLEMS OF MY OWN AND IM STUCK LISTENING TO HIS WHINING TWENTY FOUR FUCKING SEVEN. I CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE. HE TELLS ME HE CANT LIVE WITHOUT ME. I cry when i think about him. He was my closest friend for a while. If i had a magic wand i really would wish the best for him. He’s a bright kid that’s so naive. I’m not the only fish in the sea. I really liked this kid. I miss him. When he wasn’t a leech. I’ve tried everything i know. I’ve been in and out of facilities and programs myself i’ve tried to teach him what i’ve learned. I tried to care, but i’ve become so numb to this kid now. “You’re the death of me” he tells me. Why me? Why can’t i just leave? I know if i do i’ll have his death on my shoulders for the rest of my life. please no. someone please help me. i’m in so much pain. and i feel so trapped. s sorry if this got messy i feel physically ill right now. edit: this is probably really offensive or triggering but i just felt so much hate inside of me near the end.

I don't know what to do. I tried everything--offering emotional support whenever he calls me to talk about his problems, giving him money to help him out with his financial problems, reaching out to him everyday to ask him if he is ok.

I would have NEVER guessed that, since he always seems a bit gloomy, but he is pretty funny and a nice guy. Let me start this off by saying that my mental state is also, well obviously not as bad as his but I do think I have light depression, that I can however deal with and that some of my friends know of. &#x200B; He was only able to tell me since he was drunk and here's his story: He was born into a VERY rich family. This meant that he never had to work for anything since he got everything from his parents and grandparents. At some point in his childhood his parents divorced VERY violently. His grandfather from his mothers side has even gone as far as to sue his father, for reasons that I don't know. His father lost the lawsuit iirc and since then he has been a bit disconnected from the world, and started drinking heavily. He grew up in a small village, and he never had any friends the same age as him, not until a few years ago when he got into my class. He got bullied from first to 6th grade, and this left heavy psychological damage to him. His brother is a few years older than him, and a few years ago he started only living with his father. My friend however is at his fathers place like 40% of the time. Well, now he is in my class, most of us like him and I don't know anyone who holds a personal grudge against him. He however thinks, that most people hate him. I tried really hard to convince him that this isn't the case, but he doesn't believe me. He said that he doesn't care about anything except what other people think about him. Since he thinks everyone hates him, he hates himself as well I guess. After some talking he also told me that he thinks he would like to kill someone, however he won't do it since he doesn't want to face the consequences. The only people he really cares about are his grandma, his grandpa and his brother, and his grandfather passed away a month ago, since then I noticed that something changed in him. &#x200B; I already conviced him to tell his mother about this, but I'm not sure if he'll do it. I woulld however call a therapist myself if he doesn't do it, I think he would accept the help if he doesn't have to get it himself. Well, there are many things I'd like to write here, but I can't remember everything. I'm very tired so I won't be replying until tomorrow, but PLEASE help me out, I don't know what to do. &#x200B; If you need further Information I can provide some, just ask.",

968,My friend is suicidalHello Dr Peterson i need your help i have a female friend my age (17) who is suicidal she has had mental health issues since the 8th grade including body dysmorphia depression and she self harms and cuts almost daily recently she started drinking to cope with a demanding deprecating view of herself i managed to help her stop drinking around a week ago but she refuses to help herself and look for solutions she claims going to a therapist was useless i suggested antidepressants because i thought it could help she still has not tried them. I guess after all this rambelling my question is this how could you help a person who is not interested in helping themselves i thought i could just ignore her and show her that people around her wont care if she doesn't but i am afraid she'll end her life if she feels pressure from people close to her. Please she needs help and i have no idea what to do she doesn't take her problems seriously and ignores when people try to help,

973,"I think my friend is suicidalI think my friend is suicidal, and I don't know how to help him. &#x200B; He tends to demean his worth on social media a lot. While he plays it off as a joke, as someone who knows him it's really not. Behind the funny low self-esteem posts and jokes, our late night messages show how he really feels about himself; he believes he has no worth and no one loves him, he feels like a failure to his family and friends, that he doesn't deserve anything because he's useless. Over the last two weeks it's been getting worse -- distancing himself from friends, more self-degrading posts, and drawing rather graphic drawings in his free time depicting suffocation and self harm. &#x200B; I've told him that I care about him; that his friends and family care about him and we're here for him. That he is worth every bit of time we dedicate to him, that he is useful no matter what he may think, and so much more. However, he seems to look past those reassurance and instead focuses on his negative thoughts. I've sent him the teen hotline, but i don't know if he's used it. His self-destructive behavior is starting to scare me, and, as someone who's been in a similar place as him and has taking the darker route, I'm beginning to worry that he may be having darker thoughts; that he has/is considering self harm, or that he is considering suicide. &#x200B; I don't know what else to do, or what I even *can* do. I feel helpless. I want to help him be okay and be happy, but if he's not listening to me, his other friends, or his family, I don't know what I can do. So that's why I come to you r/teenagers; what can I do?",
974,"I think my friend is suicidal, and I don’t know what to do.I met my best friend on Twitter a couple of years ago. She lives in another state, but we’ve spent time together before. She stayed with my family and I last Christmas and also came to visit me in college for a couple of weeks. We talk on the phone a lot, but I am starting to worry about her. The last time we were on the phone she mentioned to me that she cuts herself. She has mentioned this before, but during this call it was different. She was laughing about it like practically bragging. She even told me that she brought what she uses to cut herself to my apartment and did it while she stayed with me. I can’t imagine why someone would say something like that as if it was no big deal. As I am someone who has gone through mental health issues and is currently in recovery, I am constantly trying to encourage her to seek help and tell her that certain behaviors are unhealthy but I am getting nowhere. I am thinking that it is time to tell someone in her family, but I don’t know if that’s too far. She has gone to therapy before, but her parents don’t know the severity of what’s going on so they took her out and she’s not on her meds. Her and I have discussed multiple times that she probably has BPD but she hasn’t been in treatment long enough to be fully diagnosed, and the longer she goes without treatment the worse she’s getting. She’s 19, but she still lives with her family. I have no way to contact her parents or siblings other than finding their social media or something and messaging them, but I feel that might be too far. Should I step in (if so, how?), or is she old enough where it’s just not my place?",

977,"My friend is suicidal, she is seeking therapy, but is afraid of being put into a mental hospitalMy friend, 15 years old, tells me almost every week that she is suicidal. From what she tells me, her parents spoil her to make her love them; she is constantly stressed about school and is failing almost everything; She has a traumatic past, almost being raped; being harassed and bullied to the point of when she goes back to or even near her last school she starts balling, I've been with her when it happens too and she couldn't move she was so upset; she has cut herself and just told me she did it again after 2 months. Point is, she is definitely not okay. I told her to get a therapist, to tell other people and she did. She actually listened to me and it was okay for awhile. But she got attached, like really attached and I didn't feel the same. She wanted to have sex with me and was serious to me about it. You might think im bullshitting that, considering im 15. But unlike every other fucking horny teen, I don't want to have sex just to have sex. I want to with someone I like and someone Im attracted to which im not to her. But ever since I've said no she has been worse. She did get a therapist, but tells her almost nothing. She thinks she will put her in a mental hospital. And honestly, it doesn't sound too farfetched. I don't know what to do. I'm the only one she tells things to and if I tell someone she'll know its me. She might be put into a mental hospital, and im worried she might be pushed over the edge. If I tell, she looses all trust in me. I don't know what to do.",
978,"My friend is suicidal drinks herself to sleep and gets high to forget about her horrible familyMy friend (let's call her Isabella) and I are both freshman​ in high school. We met earlier in the year through a mutual friend and started becoming close friends. I only started to find out how bad her life was as of four weeks ago. I don't know when it started but on multiple occasions Isabella had been raped by her 20+ year old stepbrother (SB) who's twice the size of her and absolutely terrifies her. One time she got drunk and high and woke up in her SB's bed, needless to say she broke down immediately. Tonight she told me that her SB would buy her pregnancy tests and force her to take them. One of them came up positive so at 14 years old he forced her to take abortion pills. She lives in fear now, when a certain song plays she starts crying, when she smells cologne she gets a panic attack, and she doesn't trust men anymore. I think I'm the only guy she trusts. CPS was called so she's safe now, from her SB at least, because every night I go to sleep wondering if she's taking a handful of pills, and every morning I wake up desperately waiting for a text message to tell me she's still alive. Tonight she also told me that the night before she started to overdose on Tylenol but only stopped because she wouldn't want me to blame myself if she died. But what makes me sick is how her family treats her. Her mom and stepsister actually blame her for everything, they said ""You wanted your SB to get in trouble so you let him rape you"" and she's starting to believe them. Her dad hears all of this and does nothing, won't even mention what happened so now she thinks he blames her too.",
979,"My friend is suicidalMy friend is suffering, a lot. She has a rare disease that changed her appearance, made her go through chemo, have heart surgery, forced her to leave school and she can’t have a job. She’s really jaded (understandably) and pessimistic about her situation, which I also understand. I live in a different state from her so it’s really hard to support her. She pushes me away and says I only talk to her because I’m lonely and she’s a burden to everyone, which is so not true and it hurts that she thinks I don’t value her friendship. I feel awful saying this but it’s exhausting and frustrating trying to support her, especially because it feels like nothing I do can help. I texted her mom to let her know that my friend is saying she wants to die... but I don’t know what to do anymore. I really don’t think she will do anything because her family had to shell out so much money for her treatment and she would feel incredibly guilty. I feel like a bad friend for not knowing what to do, does anyone have any advice? I think I’m taking this all way to personally and my intentions are about trying to help her.",
980,My friend is suicidalI don’t know what to do anymore I’m sorry if this post is just rambling. About once a month I have to talk my friend out of suicide and every week I counsel her through depressive episodes and anxiety attacks. She already has a therapist but needs support from me to get through her illness. I just don’t know if I can do it myself but I have to. It destroys me every single time and I constantly feel so weak and sad and anxious at every point of the day now thinking about if she were to actually kill herself. Even at happy moments and completely unrelated moments throughout the day it’s constantly in the back of my mind. I can’t get rid of it. It’s like I’m obsessed. I feel so sick but if I don’t deal with her I think she’ll actually do it. I tell her to get professional help and I direct her to hotlines and medication possibilities and other people she can go to for support but she still feels awful and I still feel awful. I haven’t talked to her about it because I’m scared that it’ll push her to the edge knowing she’s stressing me out. I’m so stuck. I’m so scared. I don’t know what to do. It’s been like this for a year now. I can’t do this anymore. I consider myself a generally happy person and think I’ve conquered most of my anxiety but this is what’s keeping me from being happy. It makes me feel so so shitty and it’s really the only thing making me feel shitty. I need this gone,

It's a complicated situation and it's too much to go into in detail. He found someone else, we broke up, 6 months later we agreed to give it another go, 3 weeks in he said he can't deal with a relationship so we are no longer together. Either way I still care about him a lot and I'm worried sick. He's always suffered with his mental health, I'm the five years I've known him. But since we broke up he's been the worst I've ever known. He doesn't eat properly, he's got himself into debt, he drinks heavily most nights to sleep. He told me he's the closest he's ever been to killing himself. He's attempted it once in the past. I don't know what to do. He's been to mind, he's spoken to a few people and is now on the waiting list to see a proper psychiatrist. But he's been on the phone to me breaking down saying he's desperate for help and he needs it now and he can't wait any longer. I thought about the crisis team but he said he's dealt with them in the past, and all they do is help you for a few days then leave you to it. I'm so worried about him. I'm scared about him now living on his own - so I'm talking with him about moving back in, even if it's just until he can get himself set financially and maybe find someone else to live with. I do offer to help him with his debt side of things all the time but he refuses to accept it. If I move in I'm hoping it will take some pressure off him. But when he falls apart I have no idea how to bring him back down or make him feel better. I've never been any good with dealing with people upset and especially not to this degree. I'm depressed and suicidal myself so I just never know what to do it what to say and it all gets a bit much for me, and sometimes I feel I make it worse. I know there are other people that know about this but I don't know if they realise how bad he is. I don't know if telling them will just upset him more because I don't think he wants everyone bringing it up or talking to him about it. I just know how desperate he is for help and I just want to help so badly, but I don't know what to do. Tldr; friend is suicidal.

985,"I'm not sure if my friend is suicidalHello everyone, I'm hoping that someone more knowledgeable than me can give some advice. I went out to lunch with my friend today, and he just seemed...off. He's kind of a spacey guy, but we generally have really great conversations and feed well off of each other. Today, it seemed as if each of his thoughts was not connected to the next. He would say something, and then it would seem like he completely forgot that he just said that. It was just bizarre. He also was laughing just a little too much, like I would say something kind of mundane and he would laugh way too hard. We have a good joking relationship, but this was out of character. He also started tearing up a couple of times. He was not choked up and didn't break down or anything like that, but his eyes got all welled up. The first time it happened I asked him if he was okay and he was just kind of like ""yeah I'm fine."" I figured it could be allergies or something. It happened again, and, again, I asked him if he was okay. This time he was more like ""yeah man, are you okay?"" Then he asked it again, ""are you okay?"" I wasn't sure if he was trying to deflect the question, or if he was just being weird in general. I figured I might be overthinking it and maybe my friend was just messing with me (or just really out of it today), but someone else pulled me aside and asked if everything was okay with my friend so I doubt it's all in my head. My first two thoughts were either suicide/depression or drugs; he was coherent, walking fine, and able to order his food and everything so I doubt he was on something. It was just weird that it felt like he couldn't finish a full conversation and wasn't acting like himself at all. He's never talked about suicide or anything like that so it's not like I've been worried about him long-term, it's something that I just noticed today. I just wanted to see if anyone has input on whether or not this could be a sign of depression/suicidal thoughts.",

990,"My friend is suicidal, but I don't know I can help herMy friend is suicidal. It's been like this the whole time I've known her. People have always come to me for help, never really understood why but it's always been a thing, and until now it's never been a problem. With this friend however, things are obviously really serious and it's starting to take a toll on me. Like I've always been a really happy person but lately I've been feeling really down. Earlier tonight I told her that I felt like I was becoming more of a therapist than a friend, and that I wanted to support her and stay close, but couldn't take on all of her problems myself. To this she basically responded by saying she would get totally out of my life, and if she killed herself it would be more or less my fault. So this basically puts me in a position where I can only see 2 possible choices: A. I keep playing therapist. She keeps dragging me down. I potentially save her life, or at least I know I made an effort if she does something stupid B. I distance myself. Maybe things turn out ok. Maybe she kills herself and I blame myself for the rest of my life I don't like either of these. For the record: - Friend not girlfriend - Her parents know - Many other friends are willing to help her out, but she won't let them - Is getting psychiatric help and is on medication, but won't take it seriously",

I've been looking after her; she's been staying at my place through every day and nearly every night. And I need to be there for her, because if I don't, she really could do something drastic. But God, its awful. I myself have severe depression and anxiety, and I can barely look after myself. How am I supposed to look after someone else if I haven't showered in a week? I can't look after myself and her at the same time, and she needs it more. But I keep having to push my own feelings down to be strong for her, and its exhausting. I'm not strong, or positive, I don't really believe everything will work out. But I have to act like it. My therapist and my counsellor have both told me to look after myself first, but its not that simple. If I'm the only thing keeping her from doing anything to herself, then I can't possibly priortise my well being. If my friend got even a whiff of just how hard this is for me right now, I think she would go through with it. The worst part is not knowing how long this is going to last. I tell her to move her social worker appointment up (instead of in three weeks) so she can get some help, but she says she doesn't like her social worker. I tell her to call the mental health crisis line so her intake appointment with publicmental health will be sooner, but she shrugs it off. I try to get her to eat at least something, but she won't. I try to help her to sleep regularly, but she can't. She can't or won't do anything to help herself, and so there's no foreseeable end to this. This will probably sound stupid after everythibg else I've listed, but I just need a break. I can barely get 5 minutes alone, and when I do, I'm worried about her. I'm autistic, I need a lot more down time then the average person, and I can't be around people for as long as a normal person. I'm heading towards a breakdown myself because of this, and honestly, what are we gonna do then? I have to be there for her of noone else will, because she is my friend and I love her and obviously I'd sacrifice my health in a heartbeat to keep her alive. But I'm getting desperate, and I don't know if I have the strength to keep it up.",
993,"My friend is suicidal and i dont know what to doTonight, him, two other friends, and I were hanging out at the mall. All was fine until my friend got silent while we were eating, he was zoning out and fidgeting with his sweater. We all got worried and tried talking to him, but he just stayed quiet. Twenty or so minutes later, he just said ""I'll see you guys later"" and left, we were all worried as he had to walk home and we didn't want him to do anything stupid. I asked if he's ok, he said ""I'm sorry, but i'm not"", I asked if he made it home ok and he said ""i wish i didn't, to which i replied ""i'm glad you did"". We were texting for a while and he said a lot of red flags for someone who's gonna attempt suicide, and obviously we were all worried, we were talking to each other if we had done anything wrong, and we decided to apologize in case he did. We're all worried that he's gonna try something stupid, and they agreed that it'd be the best for me to be the one who talks to him, as I'm the closest friend he has. Anyways, I asked if anything happened to make him feel that way, and that if it was our fault, he could tell us and we wouldn't be upset because his safety is more important than our feelings. He said that he just feels that way for no reason, then I remembered that a few weeks ago he told me he has diagnosed depression and was prescribed anti-depressants, but his mom won't allow him to take them. I told him that he needs to take his meds as that should be his priority, and not worrying about being punished (i know they won't be the only thing he needs but it's better than nothing) I looked that up, and apparently his parent denying him his medicine is medical neglect, and I just wanna know what i should advise him to do from here Sorry if this is incoherent, im pretty upset rn. Just so y'all know, we're both 15 so he can't get himself to therapy, move out, etc. so answers that take that into account would be heavily appreciated",

He has always been emotionally unstable, with symptoms pointing to aspergers and autism. It started a few weeks back when he got drunk at a party and broke down and got very depressed. I was not present at that event, so I cant describe it closer, but I know that the thing I am going to describe was not singular. I went to a party with him a few days ago, where he again got drunk and broke hard, crying and talking about killing himself. He was very detailed about even possibly not surviving the night. He thinks of events like these as ""showing weakness"", his reasons for suicide contemplations are ""having no friends, noone caring about him, and having not accomplished anything in his life"". FYI, we are in our early twenties. I think I am the only one he can talk to this about, since all of his other friends I know of are incapable of talking to someone in this situation, and ignoring his breakdowns completely. His parents are dismissive of the possibility of suicide, his two siblings too young to understand. I think he himself would not search for help, as he thinks of it as weakness as said before. I do not want to risk my perceived position as the only one he can talk to about this by telling him directly that I think he should search for help. I dont know what to do next, please help me.",

But simaltaneously in the western world suicide among men in twice as common among women. Is that to say that society treats men worse than women if we are applying the same logic that we do to transexuals. By this logic men are much more oppressed than women. Edit: I just wanted to clarify my intentions behind this post. It has a bit of a double meaning so to say. The main aim of this post isn't to say that men or women (and other groups) are the most oppressed. It was more to highlight how we use simplify a statistic to the point where we don't consider multiple reasons for it (in this case high suicide among transsexuals). I wanted to say that if we use such an approach to male suicide rate one by such ""incomplete"" logic. Conclude that men just as transgenders are one of the most oppressed groups.

1006,"YSK the signs that someone is suicidal.People often slip through the cracks when it comes to this. It's baffling how many times you hear the family or friends of someone say ""But they were so happy! We never knew!"" It's important to know these things, especially for the sake of your friends or children. Note: I'm not a psychologist, but I've been there before many times. These aren't all the signs, and everyone is different. -Giving away possessions or passwords. -Suddenly being happy/positive after a bad depressive episode. -An overabundance of suicide jokes/gestures (i.e. putting a finger gun to the head or miming cutting the wrists). -Isolation and ghosting. -A flurry of messages, whether by mouth, phone, email, etc. of how much you mean to them. -Changing language (ex. saying ""goodbye"" instead of the usual ""see you later""). -Dangerous behavior (if I die, I die). -Hopeless responses to questions (ex. When asked ""Are you okay?"" They answer ""I don't know""). -Trying to push loved ones away by being mean. -Talking excessively about death. -Disassociating or appearing to be ""spaced out"". -Suddenly treating their loved ones to fun dates and experiences in order to make final good memories. -Self harm. -Nihilistic responses (i.e. ""Nothing matters anymore""). -Sharp decline in mental health (not eating, not smiling, being tired, etc.). -Asking how you'd feel if they suddenly disappeared. If you think someone might be suicidal, ASK them if they are. Ask them straight up if they're having suicidal thoughts. Be there for them, let them know you can be a shoulder to cry on, and most importantly, believe them when they tell you they're struggling. EDIT: More signs include... -Lack of hygiene. -Self deprecating language and behavior. -Sleeping all day or not sleeping at all. -Thanking loved ones for being there, supporting them, etc. -Asking questions about death (ex. ""How many tylenol do you think would kill someone?"") -Suddenly becoming extremely depressed. -Being caught will pills/a knife/etc. in their room (this one is for your kids. Take this very, very seriously). -Refusing to accept that things will be better or that someone cares about them. -Apologizing suddenly for any past altercations as if they want to end things on a positive note. -Not being interested in ANYTHING anymore. This includes hobbies, the future, others' concerns, religion, and more. -Crying a lot. -Apathy (feeling nothing).",

I can also argue that it fits the ""My body, my choice"" mantra even more than abortion because there is no other (potential) person/life involved. The other argument is: if abortion is illegal, they'll do it under the table anyway and potentially risk infection or even their lives in a ""back alley"" abortion. Why doesn't the same apply for suicide? If someone wants to end his/her life and it's not allowed in a controlled medical procedure, they're going to do it under the table.

I'm not a good writer to begin with and I've been awake for like 28 hours Just need to vent real quick. I've been working at a nursing home for just over 6 months now. I absolutely love my job and the residents I care for. Most of my coworkers are gungho Born Again christian types and I've kept my atheism a secret for the most part. Two days ago an ex-coworker committed suicide after her kids were taken by CPS. I personally couldn't stand the woman. She's the kind person who would talk about how ""they shouldn't teach sexuality in schools when talking about LGBT rights and complain that america was being overrun by ""Islamists"" and overall being a total bitch. Still it was incredibly sad when I heard about what she did. I had noticed the signs since I was once dangerously close to making an attempt myself. I tried to encourage her to seek professional help. However she kept saying that it'll be ok because god doesn't give you more than you can handle. When I came into work yesterday some coworkers who were close to her started talking about the suicide. I figured I'd join in and try to see some different sides of this ex-coworker. Shortly after I joined the conversation, they started belittling this woman, say she should had just held out a little cause ""god doesn't give you more than you can handle"" I was appalled by the lack of empathy for her situation and blurted out a bit tactlessly, ""Well obviously he did because she killed herself"" After taking a moment to register my brashness, they proceeded to talk about how you have to wait since ""you're in god's time"" and ""she shouldn't have been so selfish."" This pissed me off but I was just gonna ignore it just to not cause a scene. I need to give credit to one of my l coworkers,who kinda figured out at this point I was clearly annoyed at this point mentioned tried to defuse the situation. She reminded the others that people have different outlooks on things and it could be a good idea to listen. It was a nice sentiment. Or it would have if it wasn't interrupted halfway through by one of my other coworkers making a comment about how while they're not a good Christian, at least they're (and say it with me now) Not An Atheist™️ That was the straw that broke the camel's back Individually I could have just felt with the bashing of suicide victims, and belittling of atheists, and the overall lack of empathy they show. But in aggregate I was done being . So I told them I was an atheist. Now my coworkers are mentioning how I'm going to hell and they'll be in heaven with our ex-coworker. I just make a joke about how all the fun people are there and try to change the subject. They however persist and start talking about how great god is and how I need to accept god to save my soul. I'm completley done with them at this point and drop a guilt trip for them along the lines of this (fluffed slightly for effect): ""Fun fact: Did you know that over the course of this conversation dozens of people have died of starvation? That there are people out there being threatened as property still, just so they can be used as sexual playthings and may never find their way out of it? That according to new court files, about 10% of the catholic priests in the US have credible accusations of sexual assault on minors. That he allowed your supposed friend, a devoted worshiper of the same god, to get to a point in her life where she thought the only way out of her pain was suicide. That friend who died two days ago. And look at you now instead of talking about the good times you had, you're belittling her. You aren't even feigning sadness You're just talking about her as if she was some immature child who got a little too impatient, and then minutes later told me that I deserve an eternity of torture and suffering just because I have a different opinion. If your omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent, and omnibenevolent god is real and he considers all of this ok with, he's not worth my time and I'll to go to hell on principle.""

I hate how our modern society has ruined people, The culture of school-marriage-job-death. Pro extreme-capitalism, materialism. People are dying, 1,000,000 homeless, 30,000 die every year due to lack of healthcare in the USA, 500,000 bankrupt due to medical bills every year. 1.5 trillion dollars of student loan debt which takes kids decades to pay off. The earth is dying and it is noticeable today, with some drought, fire, extreme weather. Species are going extinct. 2020 America isn’t great. It is killing us. I believe we need bernie2020, who would spend 17 trillion to try to mitigate the worst effects of climate change, abolish all medical debt, all student loan debt, Guarantee healthcare, higher education, daycare, pre-k, an income with a federal jobs garuntee, to all people. His Federal Jobs Guarantee would guarantee an income 15$/h to all people who want to work. These people would be hired and trained to build 100% renewable energy infrastructure by 2030, and build public housing to house all homeless (for all who want it^TM); and rebuild crumbling roads, bridges, water, pipes, etc. Collapse will be rough. His climate plan likely can’t stop collapse, but he can make our last few decades way better. Bernie’s policies would eliminate some of the major problems facing young people that lead to suicide, like medical bills, climate change, education, etc. His policies save 14trillion$ over ten years, the majority of people agree with his policies, he would choose a good vp to continue the revolution when (if) he dies in office. I know a portion of r/collapse believes all politics is dumb and all voting is 100% rigged and pointless show, but I disagree. The establishment wouldn’t spend billions to kick voters off the ballots, gerrymander, and do other forms of voter suppression if votes didn’t affect things. To conclude, I am annoyed how sad my generation is. I am doing everything I can to help my people stop suffering. But it wears me down, so I’ll fight more, by saying #FeelTheBern",

I was stunned into silence. Words accelerated through my mind, but the anatomical structures and physiological processes involved in speech production were severed completely. I refused to look at the source of the voice. “Do you want out? Do you want to quit?” The voice pierced and twisted as if jostling for position with the one I knew to be my former lover’s, my sweet Birdie. The latter...the latter was equally as familiar, but the slurs and the vitriol made it too ugly to want to face head on; My bitter, alcoholic self, seething with rage as every syllable slithered down my ear canal and infected my mind, urging me to strike myself for a momentary respite. I clutched at my shirt and tried to breathe, focusing on the things around me and counting them, an old technique I’d recalled from years ago when a far weaker me needed calming. My eyes fell upon my wooden desk, sturdy despite its age, the place where so many of these cases were written up, including this one. A sense of pleasant familiarity began to ebb its way into my body. “You can quit anytime you want to, Laura. You just need to be willing to take the plunge…” The voice cackled, lights intermittently flickering on and off, visages of something scuttling around as I continued to seek out familiar objects, some semblance of normalcy. I saw the couch where so many had laid their bodies for the final time, my face the last image they saw, the doctor’s view of me obscured by his tinted glasses. “You just need to be willing to do your fucking job… so many came here with expectations and a desire to seek peace...why should I be any different? No, why should *we* be any different?!” The voice threatened to make my skull split open with the accusation; I only perceived the tears running down my face when the drops cooled my reddened complexion. I pressed on, knowing that if I was going to do this, I would do it properly. Emotions had to be separate from the job. Finally, my eyes fell upon a photo frame that had fallen from the desk and landed face down, I reached for it amid the sea of misery, chaos and pain, searching desperately for a breath of fresh air. I found it as soon as I overturned the frame. My eyes stopped watering and my breathing steadied. A younger me, mid-laugh with eyes scrunched tight in total joy, held in the heavily tattooed arms of a woman four years my senior, wrapping themselves around my waist in an embrace that can never be truly replicated. I still remember how she smelled, the sound of her laughter, the sense of being entirely someone else’s as well as your own, enraptured in one moment. It was Birdie and I on our second anniversary. Her long black locks tied back in a neat bun, a couple of strands falling loose from her head and playfully dangling as she stared down at me, making me feel seen in a way that no other person ever had. I smiled and stifled a sob - professionalism came first. Returning to my feet, I inhaled deeply and found my way back to composure, placing the photo back where it belonged in the process. “Alright, if this is how it has to be, let’s do it properly.” I said, shoulders heavy but upright. “I’m ready for you, now.” \--- “I won’t ask you if you have the money…” I began, moving across the living room with eyes fixed on the empty chair, *my* chair. I waited a moment, expecting the bitter voice to screech or for the lights to continue to flicker. But, to my surprise, neither came to pass. Instead, a soft breeze passed me as a gentle silence fell over the room. In an instant, Birdie had switched spots, from the couch to my chair. The reality of the situation became clear as I awkwardly eased myself onto the sofa. Raven locks tied back, pale white complexion, a cute snaggle tooth grin adorned in piercings that endeared itself to me from the moment she rested her almond eyes upon mine and laughed at my awkward, misworded jumble of a joke. There she was. Not bloodied and lifeless on our bed but permeable, alive, here. But it couldn’t be her. It just couldn’t. I knew it because I had all of those piercings in a small manila envelope, tucked away in my drawer. A somber looking police officer handed it to me after she was cremated. In the days following her death, I refused to move even from one room to another without the envelope in hand, as if my own life force was fixed to the assortment of metal pieces that once embellished her face. Consumed by grief and incapable of letting go, I mentally transferred the essence of what made her *her* into material objects, things I could still see, hold, talk to. I understand the irrationality of my actions, but grief eschews logic entirely. It’s like an acute, temporary insanity. On particularly cruel days, I still cradle each cold metal piercing in the palm of one hand, counting each one while I struggle to recall the feel of her arms around my waist, the scent of her perfume. It’s the closest I’ve gotten to prayer in my life. My eyes widened and every part of me wanted to cry, but I was not that woman anymore and it was important I showed that. Instead, I smiled softly. “It’s been a while, hasn’t it, Birdie?” I asked, pushing every emotion I had down into the pit of my stomach. Anything less would be a disaster. She smiled back, my heart melting ever so slightly. “Still doubting it’s me, Elle?” She pulled my favorite nickname out, a dirty trick but it made me chuckle and broke some of the tension. A sudden comfort swept over me, warm like a blanket fresh out of the dryer draped around my shoulders. “Honestly? It can’t be you,” I began, oddly unable to grapple with the uncanny situation despite everything I’d heard from clients, even experienced myself. “There have been many, many people that pass through this room, but someone I know is dead? Someone I buried?” I shook my head, the possibility of her presence beyond me still. “I’m either losing it, or something is seriously fucked up.” Birdie leaned forward, never adjusting her gaze from my own. “You’re not wrong, you’re definitely losing it,” she joked, flashing me the grin again before adjusting her position. “But, I’ve got another reason for being here, you know why... you just haven’t figured it out yet.” I cocked my head to the side, falling back into work habits and replaying those bitter declarations from earlier in my head, the cogs in my mind beginning to turn as the picture became clearer. “Alright, I’ll bite. Tell me your story, Birdie. All of it...even the bits I don’t want to know.” She leaned back and let her head drape over the back of the chair for a moment, exhaling sharply before beginning her tale, the one that haunts me above all the appalling narratives I’ve heard and documented. “For the longest time, I was able to keep those dark clouds at bay. They’d followed me all my life, from the moment I was capable of looking up at the sky and knowing that black is not the color everyone around me was seeing… I don’t mean that just figuratively, either. I mean I *literally* could only ever see black clouds… kinda goth, huh?” She forced a smile as I maintained my stare. She coughed before adding, “see, I don’t know how this kind of perpetual, stagnant misery affects other people… I can only tell you how it affects… *affected* me. It was like a numbing agent being applied to me in cycles, starting from childhood. Sometimes, it’d just be a few hours... my favorite book would fail to capture my interest and I’d take any slight change in tone as impending abandonment, the clouds overhead pouring with rain or ejecting horrific sounds when it got bad. But, it’d pass and I would move on…” “So you had your bad days and they were punctuated with good, seems pretty standard so far, but I can relate to that…” I replied, affirming as much as I’d done in her life as I continued to do in her passing, that I understood her struggles as best I could. “Right, I know… but eventually the numbness wouldn’t subside. By the time I was twenty, I had so few days where the sky wasn’t screaming out with the voices of things I still don’t understand, where the only emotion I would come to know was abject disconnection. I spent those next few years avoiding the world outside my home for fear of hearing the clouds calling to me, rainy days were the most dangerous for that…” She shuddered as she finished, looking out the window for a moment before continuing. “I remember the day I met you... I’d gone to the bar to dampen my sorrows, even though the clouds were almost obsidian and the sounds were overwhelming, I didn’t care. I *knew* I had to go there that day. Your nose was pressed in a book, reading on a barstool of all places,” she laughed, the memory bittersweet now to both of us. “Some guy was bothering you… you were anxiously trying to get him to leave you alone but rapidly getting overstimulated and it was going badly. I stepped in and asked you slowly, calmly how I could help and…” “And I only saw you, for the first time in my life I was focused entirely on one thing,” I finished, grinning as she reciprocated and nodded. “For a time, the clouds weren’t as difficult to ignore, but storms can only be held back for so long, Elle. I held mine off for a long, long time. It came for me the night of our last argument and I knew that was it. I was given a choice; lose her or lose yourself.” I felt a lump in my throat following this statement, an impossible choice for anyone. “But didn’t you lose both in the long run?” She shook her head, a sad smile written across her face. “That night, as I took the gun in quivering hands, I heard a scuttling sound from outside our bedroom. Sounds of something clawing at the door, then a low droning sound... calling to me. They were ready for me and this was the payoff; protecting you in the process.” Tears began to streak her face. “I want you to know… I *need* you to know, Elle, it wasn’t your fault. It was quick and I didn’t suffer, but I just wanted you to be safe. I didn’t know how we would end up in the same room again one day, but I never… *never* wanted it to be like this. With all of them around us, with the clouds overhead…” She shook in her seat, grief overtaking her as I barely held back my own. “I’m so, so sorry for the pain I put you through, Elle. I loved you, you were the sunlight that ripped through my dark clouds and let flowers grow on dead earth. You were my fucking lighthouse when every day threatened to drown me… I just wish you could’ve seen sooner.” “Seen what? What do you mean?” I pressed her. Our usual dynamic had shifted - between the two of us, I was never the one to suppress my emotions. But I wasn’t about to let the walls come down until this was resolved. As I looked at her, I noticed that her far-away gaze was no longer fixated on me, but on the massive windows behind me. Tears openly flowed down her face as she silently sobbed. “It’s raining out, Elle… it’s been raining for a long, long time. You just didn’t realize it.” I stood up and walked to the window, the clouds above an impossible landscape of the deepest black, bright streaks of crimson occasionally flashing from far above and revealing shapes littering the skylight with the most disturbing shapes imaginable, though I could not fully comprehend them. “What...what is this?” I croaked, unable to take my eyes off of what I was seeing. I caught a glimpse of two figures reflected in the window as a flash of lightning illuminated the sky. The zip tied woman stood behind Birdie’s chair, her mask-like face shattered to reveal the only feature on her underlying face - a pair of hollow eye sockets. “Who… who is she?” A look of concern crept across Birdie’s face. “Each time I’ve tried to appear to you, she’s always stood firmly in my way. Just staring with that inhuman, unmoving smirk, shaking her head in opposition. You know I’d go to war for you, and I did try. But she only grew more powerful as time passed, the longer you denied her. I had to come see you - tonight - and I knew that meant you would have to face her,” she explained. “I could barely watch as she assaulted you with those scathing words, tortured you by mimicking the crab walker, but you did *so* good. She threw everything she had at you, but you beat her. I knew you would.” Confusion still muddled my mind. The throbbing sore spot on my head certainly wasn’t helping. “Love, you *made* her. She was the physical manifestation of your grief and guilt, the feelings you never dealt with.” I turned to face her once more. “I’m so sorry,” I lamented. “I wanted to be there but I just – I just couldn’t. I was overwhelmed. I needed space. I should’ve – “ She cut me off gently. “What have I always told you?” “Never apologize for who you are,” I answered with an unexpected laugh, a flutter of pleasant nostalgia. “That’s right, Elle,” she replied with her distinctive half smile, halfhearted in the heartbreaking context. “I’m afraid to say I’m here for a reason much bigger than sharing my story with you.” Her voice splintered as she revealed, “I’m here to guide you as you leave this life behind.” “I – I’m going to die?” I stammered, equally shocked and dismayed. I’d just fought my greatest battle – and prevailed. How could this be happening? “Yes,” she confirmed, gritting her teeth to ward off the next wave of tears that I knew was coming. Birdie feigned strength in trying situations to the point that she’d push me away when she needed me most. “I knew it from the moment you injected the woman who could smell death. She leaned into you, inhaled deeply, and this euphoric smile spread across her face. As she was nearing death, I became visible to her. She locked her eyes on mine and nodded ever so slightly in response to my unspoken question.” Sorrow overcame her as she began to cry once more. “Everything fell apart for me at that moment. I wept for you, because there was so much more *life* left in you. There should have been so much more for you, you should have gone on to do so many things. It shouldn’t have to end like this.” A flurry of questions, unfulfilled wishes, and contentions rushed through my mind. I couldn’t accept this. Was I lying motionless on the floor, rendered unconscious by my fall? Was this another trick of the mind? All of these thoughts, erratic and thrumming, distilled down to one word, one question. “Why?” “You’re a smart girl, Elle. I know you’ve noticed a trend in your cases lately. You’re saying yes more often than you say no,” Birdie explained. “You’re messing with some pretty dangerous stuff here. The crab walker came first, but it’s not the only one here.” I shook my head vigorously until vertigo set in, uprooting me into a fleeting sense of weightlessness. “What the hell are they?” I asked, directing my gaze out the window as I pressed my hands flat against the glass for stability. A swarm of inhuman shadows shifted outside. I found myself grateful that their details remained obscured. Birdie shrugged lightly, frowning. “I’m not sure, but I’ll tell you what I do know. They feed on grief, guilt, pain... and most of all, death. The more they consume, the more influence they have on the reality you live in, the reality I used to live in as well… blissful in my ignorance. The living have a severely limited capacity for perception.” “What do you mean, influence?” “They magnify the wickedness already present in human nature, distorting and perverting normal insecurities, obsessions, and resentments… altering their trajectory entirely, ultimately propelling them to horrific conclusions. They feed, and the cycle continues,” she answered before adding with a shudder, “they’re absolutely insatiable. I know you’ve seen this pattern in your clients, and it’s starting to happen to you.” I flinched, racking my brain for any information to support this claim. Detecting the shift in my demeanor, Birdie softened her tone. “You caught a glimpse of the crab walker in the kitchen the other night. It would have been content to have you to itself. You keep it well fed,” she declared with an indignant laugh. “Unfortunately, others have arrived. You fought with your girlfriend last week, shoved her backwards onto the floor. I know you’re not proud of it, but it wasn’t you.” “I was overcome with a sudden rage,” I mused flatly, my eyes tracking the unsettling movement of the blackened clouds, swelling and spiraling. “Like nothing I’ve ever felt before. I try not to think of it, but I felt that pressure on my shoulders, firm and steady. Then there was the slow pooling of warm liquid dripping down the back of my neck. I hurt her, and I’m so ashamed to admit it, but the truth is… I wanted to do much more than that.” Stating this aloud alarmed me. “What can I do? How can I stop this?” Birdie visibly deflated, despondent. “I don’t think there’s anything you can do, love.” She hesitated, apparently weighing a difficult decision. “I need to show you something. It’s going to scare you, but it will help you understand.” I blinked once and reality shifted, fell apart and constructed anew. The floor beneath me, the window before me, all the things I understood to be *real* appeared hazy and indistinct. I jolted around to face Birdie, dizzy and desperate to find my footing again. I was fascinated to find that she was now rendered in vivid color. The variety of hues tattooed across her body were nearly palpable. The inked pomegranate on her shoulder looked almost edible. The biomechanical tattoo on her opposite arm grew fully animated; machinery whirring, gears turning. Wonder turned to dread as a flicker of motion in the corner of the room distracted my gaze where an impossibly tall figure loomed. Its shoulders hunched to accommodate the ceiling, now barely visible to me. My eyes lethargically trailed up its body. An eternity seemed to pass before I finally located its face – two beady eyes and a monstrous smile with fingernails where teeth should have been. Other creatures filtered into my line of sight, slowly at first, then rapidly, unstoppable. A torso, its back studded in twitching eyeballs, dragged itself along the floor with one rotting arm. A long, wriggling stretch of mucous covered flesh slithered past me. Another crawled on six arms before standing upright on two legs, its monstrous, oozing pit of a mouth the only structure on its face. Another was made up of two torsos attached at the chest, its two heads facing each other. One face released a long, dripping tongue to lap at its other entirely blank face. Another’s face was composed only of four large eyes, blinking compulsively. It advanced toward me, sluggishly placing one foot in front of the other, its joints cracking with each deliberate movement. It took a few steps before I realized it was walking backward, with its head fastened on the wrong way. Another figure scuttled past me; its movement so hasty that its form was indiscernible upon first sight. As it settled, I was able to identify it by its composition - a torso with two pairs of arms on either side. The crab walker. It reared up on its back arms to display a cavernous, leaking laceration on its underside. The earsplitting hiss emitted from the cavity led me to assume it was its mouth. The sound of my name came as a comfort this time. I turned back to face Birdie as she pointed far off into the distance. The fleeting comfort was snuffed out as I followed the path of her gesture towards the window. The outer structures of my home had entirely vanished, allowing me to view the incredibly desolate area that lay beyond my normal awareness. The storm continued to rage, with frequent flashes of lightning illuminating the scene. A stone wall was erected within the barren landscape. I seized in terror, frozen in place, as I observed what the barricade had undoubtedly been constructed to contain - an endless mass of limbs, tendrils, and tangled body parts. A mess of creatures, so numerous and so vast, yet compacted so closely together that it was impossible to discriminate one from the next. The contents of the sea of horror frantically stretched in desperation towards the wall. An adult hand with what appeared to be infant’s fingers clung to the crest of the partition, its miniscule knuckles blanched white as it strained to hurdle itself over the barrier. I didn’t want to see what followed. My concept of reality reassembled as quickly as it had fallen apart. I collapsed to the floor, shocked and horrified. “I’m sorry you had to see that,” Birdie apologized. “I needed you to understand the gravity of your situation. From the eyes your doctor saw in his patient, to the creatures the left side man saw – all the things you’ve heard, really – these beasts are coming. And you are helping them to cross over. They’ve caught onto you. Each client’s misery and ultimate death brings them closer. They’re tracking the stench of death, and it’s wafting off of you, attracting them like a lure.” I sobbed on the floor, speechless. “They’ve already got their hooks in you,” she sighed, voice cracking under the weight of her words. “If you stay, I can assure you that you will destroy everything you love. You will destroy her.” She raised a digit to point at a second picture on the wall depicting myself with my current girlfriend, equal parts drunk on alcohol and drunk on love. Love that I’d never in my wildest dreams believed I would ever find again. Bolting upright, my instinctual resolve to live forced me to rebel against this assertion, one final fight. “I – I’m not ready to die! I don’t want to die. I will not make this judgment.” Birdie abandoned her seat on the couch, gliding over to the stereo on the other side of the room to press [play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyBUgOFlBU4). “You already have, love,” she countered, gesturing to the readied needle in my hand. Stunned by this revelation, my eyes widened. I couldn’t recall preparing the injection at all. “It appears I have,” I confirmed, surrendering. Emotions had to be set aside, as always. By the time you finish reading this, I will probably be gone. It seems that my unwillingness to confront my darkest truths failed to protect me, instead ushering me to this unfortunate end. Sharing my journey with you all has been the opportunity of a lifetime, but mine has come to an end. Yours hasn’t. I’ll leave you with this – if you find someone worth holding onto, never, ever let them go. That is, until the inevitability of death comes. It’s okay to love and let go in the same breath. Be stronger than me. If there is another life after this, you have my word that I will certainly try. “Come on. Let’s get out of here,” Birdie invites with that snaggle tooth smile, beckoning to me with one hand. This is [my final judgment](https://www.reddit.com/r/hercreation/).

I don't really know him as a friend, but I've known him enough to know who he is as a person. I've talked to him multiple times and we did group projects together. He was a very quiet student, was a great artist, and loved anime. In fact, on Halloween, he went to school dressed up as an anime girl. I can't remember her name, but it was all self-made and it honestly amazed me with the amount of detail with it.

1086,"My Brother committed suicide as Freshman at BYU Provo last week. I'm struggling with how much the ""Mormon Culture"" and pressure for perfection possibly led him to take his life.Hello Heathens, I'm really struggling because of an event that happened last week. My brother committed Suicide as a Freshman student preparing to go on a mission at BYU Provo last week. There has been an outpouring of love and support from both my hometown back near Seattle and also from family and other friends. We have decided to hold a family funeral down in Utah but to be honest I'm really struggling with coming to terms with this. I want to blame the church and the culture he was surrounded with but Im worried that it won't be addressed at all. My mother also passed away 5.5 years ago from a sudden heart attack and my dad thought it was best to remarry. He brought in a stepmom and 3 stepbrothers within 9 months and it was a lot to process. My brother struggled silently. But I'm worried about my involvement in a funeral this time around given that I will probably be the only black sheep at the funeral of about 100 people. I've visited a crisis counselor and have an appointment set up for after the funeral in 2 weeks. I would love your guy's thoughts and support and would totally be open to answering questions as I think it would help me process things.",

1089,"Today I went to the wake of my 10 year old student who committed suicideIt's been a rough week. Over winter break, one of the nicest 5th grade students we had decided to commit suicide. She didn't leave a note, didn't tell anyone she was going to do it, and no one knows why. She was not bullied and was very well liked at school and her parents could be strict but are very loving. (Edit: What I mean is, she was a kid who does get punished when she does wrong, but also praised relentlessly when she did right. In this day and age parents are constantly letting their kids get away with everyone -- my student did not, but her parents also loved her and constantly talked about how amazing she was. While true, we do not know what went on at home, it appears to everyone who knows the family including some staff who were very close that the family were not unkind.) We all found out this past weekend and the kids have been alright about it at school. I'm the art teacher so I saw her once or twice a week depending, and have been her art teacher for three years. I didn't really cry. I'm not the most empathetic person. I recognize a situation is sad but it's rare for something to effect me emotionally a great deal. As the week went on it was on the back of my mind constantly... Mostly just trying to understand it, and feeling sorry for her classroom teacher and friends who were close. Today after school was the wake, and all the teachers who knew her went. It was an open casket and I was getting teary eyed. Then her classmates started showing up and that was horrible. I wish the parents had kept them home to be honest, no ten year old should see their friend in a casket. All of the kids know she killed herself too, despite us trying to keep that private. The kids are all crying and that's when I started to really feel it. I overheard one student say ""We all loved her so much, why did she do this?"". There were kids curled up in corners just sobbing. One girl came up to me and just latched onto me and cried. I finally let loose and cried my eyes out the entire 45 minute drive back home. I feel so incredibly sad for these children who lost their friend. No ten year old should lose a friend but it's even worse that they know she chose to take her own life and they'll never know why. This has all been so traumatic for them and it hurts me a lot. Tomorrow is her actual funeral and a lot of teachers who had her before are taking the day off to go, including two of the 5th grade teachers. I am not, because I guess I'd like to be at the school for those kids. It might be hard for them with their classroom teacher gone and it might make them feel better to see at least one of their teachers they know at school. But I'm also scared that tomorrow will be a hot mess. Don't really know what the point of my rant is. Just wish I could wrap my head around this.",
1094,"Since 2014 when I first started watching the show, I have thought about attempting suicide three times. Each time I thought to myself, “Well, I may as well stick around and see how the show ends”. Now it is over, but I am ready to see how my own life turns out. May as well stick around for that too.edit: per reddit courtesy, I must say it. thank you for the gold ❤️",
1096,"I (33M) asked wife (35F) for divorce and she turned suicidalI (33M) asked me wife (35F) for a divorce. A lot of build up to that the prior few weeks. She lost it emotionally and turned suicidal. I really need advice on what to do. (BTW, this is a throwaway acct since I have a lot of family on Reddit.) To make a long story as short as possible; I live with my in-laws w/ my wife and two pre-teen girls. It's been this way for a three years now. I drive to work an hour and fifteen minutes each way, for a total of 2.5 hours of driving each day... 4 days a week. My job lets me work from home (the in-laws house) on Friday's. We had an opportunity a few months back to move into a new house. My Uncle / Owner of the place I work bought it for rental property, but decided to offer it to us as a rent to own deal. He offered it to me with a bonus of $1000 per month towards the mortgage, so we literally could be living in a new home for like $400 per month not including utilities. Also, it was only 15 minutes away from work. Sounded like an amazing offer to me, but not to my wife. She refused to move since it was an hour away from her family, and didn't want to move the kids from their school. My Uncle gave me a deadline on when he needed to know by, and I couldn't pull the trigger on it, so I lost out. My wife and my mother-in-law were completely against it and I didn't know what to do. Fast forward to now; we've been fighting a lot and it literally feels like I'm living with a roommate. I told her last weekend I wanted a divorce. She lost it. She bawled and screamed at me. She grabbed her keys took off while crying. Over the next hour she texted me suicidal texts on how I ""better give the girls a great life because she's not going to be around anymore"". She said she ""wouldn't go through a divorce again"".(she was previously divorced). I told her to stop talking like that and that we should focus on the girls now and co-parenting the best we can... and that it would damage the girls so badly if she went through with it. She then texts me ""goodbye, you'll never see me again"". I called her, but her phone is off. I leave the house and call the suicide hotline while driving around looking for her. Wow, were they so kind! I actually was crying on the phone telling her the situation. The woman on the phone (suicide hotline) told me to call the police if I couldn't find her soon. I go to a place I think she might be and they tell me she just left the house and is going shopping with her grandparents. WTF, why is she acting like she's going to commit suicide when she's out with her grandparents. She comes back home and later that night she's begging me to stay. My mind was so made up before all this but now I'm so unsure, because I fear for her safety. The next day the texts are rolling in while I was at work saying she will do ANYTHING if I stay. At this point, I don't want to stay but my heart breaks that someone cares so deeply for someone and that individual is going to abandon them. Also, this isn't the first time I've tried to leave over the past 10 years of marriage. She always went down the whole ""nobody loves me, and everyone wants to hurt me"". (Her previous husband was physically and mentally abusive). I've asked her to get help, but she refuses. So I would stay and our relationship would improve, but be back to terrible within a couple months at most. Please Reddit fam, help me out. TL;DR: Long time coming, asked wife for divorce and she left the house crying and saying she'll commit suicide. Now, is begging me to stay and claims willing to do anything for me. I was set on leaving, but now I'm torn on where to go from here.",

1100,"How I lost my job yesterday. Fucking bullshit you guysSo I work a pretty damn boring job. The customers suck and they’re always so anal about how I do my job. Like stfu Karen. I know what I’m doing I’ve been working here for like 4 months. Anyways. I was feeling particularly bored one day. To make matters worse I was still coming down from the 10-strip of acid and half gram of white champagne molly I had taken the night before so I was feeling irritated and depressed. I had a 10 hour shift that I had to get through so I decided I would make things interesting and do a little bit of drugs before and during my shift. I started the day off right with 400mg of DXM. Sure it’ll make me a little unfocused but that’s a sacrifice I’m willing to make to get through this shift without killing myself. Besides, my job is usually just autopilot. I also knew that if I started to get distracted or zoned out that my coworker can take over for me since we both essentially have the same responsibilities. So I clock on for my shift and all is going well. I took the dex about an hour before so I’m starting to feel the come-up and let me tell you I AM READY. Let’s have us a good motherfucking trip without any turbulence. 2 hours go by and I’m starting to feel a little out of it so I ask my coworker to take over for me and I sneak off to the bathroom to do a little bit more drugs. On my way to the bathroom some little shithead kid wants to say hi to me and shake my hand. Like umm ooookay? This little nigglet is obviously an absolute tool. Like who tf wears an airplane shirt in public? Airplanes are GAYYYY. Anyways, I was able to find the bathroom after 3 or 4 minutes walking down the aisles. I couldn’t find it for some reason 🤷‍♂️ brain fart? I waited patiently as the 4 people finished using the bathroom. It’s a single stall so the guy must’ve been helping the other 3 girls do their makeup. As they were leaving, I coughed under my breath “fag.” Only gays do makeup and fuck. I hate gays. I guess I might’ve slightly overshot my DXM dose because it took me 7 or 8 tries to figure out how to lock the door. “I just need a few bumps of something to get my head right,” I said to myself. I railed maybe 6 or 7 lines of mephedrone mixed with coke to get me nice and stimmed. Then I decided it would be a good idea to boof a few oz of kratom to take the edge off. I invited one of my subordinates to join me and he obliged. I whipped out my trusty modified double-sided boof syringe and we started passing the boof back-and-forth between our rectums. I went to leave the bathroom but not before cleaning his boof with my tounge. Fuck I hate people who waste drugs. I must’ve been in there a while because by the time I crawled out of the stall there was a line of like 10 ugly-ass midgets waiting in line who kept on phase-shifting. So I get back to my post and my coworker is starting to nod out from the perc 30s I gave him earlier. I say “take a nap homie. I got this.” Another 30 minutes go by and I realize that I’m still bored AF so I decide to crack out some whippets to do discretely. It wasn’t until I had finished 2 boxes of cartridges that I noticed my subordinates had been yelling at me the whole time. I was just so in my zone that I couldn’t be bothered. I tell them to calm the fuck down and offer them some whippits but these little pussies are still freaking out saying “omg this isn’t safe you have to stop or im calling the police.” Of course these little bitches snitched and I lost my job. The plane was only nosediving for 15 SECONDS GEEZE! **Tl;DR:** I got a little high before work and made a small mistake during my shift. My subordinates flipped out and snitched because they are total squares.",
1101,"Lost my job and ALL my savings and hit poverty levels. I'm having a terrible time rebounding and feel overwhelmingly hopeless. Advice?Hi Reddit, A little over a year ago, I had 30k in savings and was working as remote job making 75k/year. Then we (girlfriend and I) decided to move to a bigger city in hopes of better future career opportunity. Unfortunately, I was unexpectedly laid off my job only 2 months after moving. Despite our optimism, I could not find a job in my field for anything (many last interviews, but no offers), and I was unable to find temp work or min wage work (min wage jobs outright told me I was overqualified and didn't want turnaround). I blew through my unemployment and ALL my savings getting by in this higher cost area of living before moving back cross country to live with my girlfriend's parents in August. If it weren't for them offering to take us in, we would very well be homeless. We currently only have $1000 to our names and 3 pets to take care of on top of it. I also had to sell my car (old car, and I couldn't afford it's repairs so I had to sell it), and lots of our furniture and personal possessions were sold as well. At this point, I feel overwhelmingly hopeless that we will never be able to recover and acquire financial security again. I was hoping we could stay at my girlfriend's parents for up to a year while we rebuilt our savings, but her parents are getting very disgusted by us staying here, they have a very tiny home we all don't fit in, and their dog and our dogs are having massive conflicts. Basically no one is happy here. It's a shame her parents are having a change of heart about us living with them now too... So here's the rundown of where we are currently at: - We currently live in a very tiny rural town without much opportunity. A major city is about an hour commute away though. - We really need to get our own place, but because of our pets we are unable to get into the cheap apartments we can afford in the $500-700 range, and the next cheapest places/homes we have found for rent that would allow our pets are $900-1500... - We both did find low paying jobs in the area. My girlfriend graduated with her B.S. degree and found an entry level job in her field paying $15 an hour. I found a warehouse job for $10 an hour. It's something, but I look at if we moved out and pretty much all our income would be going to expenses/bills. - I've pretty much given up hope on finding work in my old career. I had worked as a Sound Designer in video games for 4 years, but the job competition is insane and the job security nonexistent. I'm currently back in college online earning my B.S. degree in Accounting and Business Management (hoping to find work in either HR or Accounting), but I will not graduate for another 8 months minimum. I don't know how hopeful I feel about finding a decent job either after graduating, and it will probably require a relocation... Basically, I'm not too optimistic about gainful employment after getting my degree, but my past experiences may have just made me cynical. - Another thing, any type of distant relocation is out of the question at this point. :( This limits the job opportunities we could apply for, especially if I ever happened to find something in my old career of sound for games. In short, the only option I see right now given the circumstances is that we get our own place in town to live, which will pretty much require us to use most, if not all, of our income to get by. My warehouse job is not very stable either, as some weeks I only get 20 hours and others 40. I don't see how we will ever be able to build up our savings at this rate and recover from this terrible situation we found ourselves in. What does reddit suggest I do? I've thought of joining the military, but unfortunately I don't agree with what the military currently stands for (basically fighting a rich man's greed battle), and ALL of my family are strongly against me joining the military. I figured I could try to take out extra student loans for living expenses, but I would like to keep my debt to a minimum. Lastly, it's worth mentioning that me and my girlfriend are not careless spenders and very good with our finances. We both have always lived financially secure up until last year, and our credit scores are both excellent (750+). One last option would be to ask some of my family members for financial help, but I generally feel terrible about doing that. I shouldn't have to burden them. Thanks for hearing me out. Hopefully you guys can offer some tangible suggestions that can help us get back on our feet as quick as possible!",
1102,"I work in the vaping industry and just lost my job with no notice. Had a panic attack this morning and thought I was having a heart attack. The nurse was concerned that I might be “vaping flavors” 🤦🏼‍♀️This has been such a surreal freaking month. Watching our community suffer blow after bullshit blow and the destructive repercussions of the widespread ignorance around vaping. I’ve worked in the industry for 6 long years and helped hundreds of thousands of people stay off of cigarettes. In the last couple of weeks, I’ve lost the ability to order eliquid, then I lost a job that I loved more than anything. I’ve watched multiple people I care about go back to cigarettes. Naturally I’m under a lot of stress right now trying to figure out how to keep my head above water now that I’m unemployed. I started having intense chest pain this morning which quickly evolved into the worst panic attack of my life. I had my fiancé call a triage nurse because bad panic attacks love to convince you 100% that you’re having a heart attack and will drop dead any second. The nurse asks me a bunch of questions to determine whether or not I should go to the hospital. Nurse asks if I smoke. I tell her no. She asks if I vape or use e-cigarettes. I tell her I do, but only use 1.5mg. She immediately gets a stern tone in her voice and asks “YoU’Re NoT vApInG AnY FlAvOrS, aRe yOu!?” I roll my eyes and just tell her no. This is what we’re up against. Trained medical professionals think that tobacco flavors are fine, but fruity menthol is cause for grave concern. I just feel so completely defeated about all of this nonsense and I don’t know whether to laugh or cry. As a bonus, I went to the store to pick up a prescription a couple hours later, and they were periodically playing a warning over the intercom about the CDC warning against e-cigarettes and to visit the pharmacy to learn more about solutions to nicotine addiction. Big pharma isn’t wasting any time trying to capitalize on our suffering.",

1105,"Advice\*I don't really know where else to post this, this is just kind of a shot in the dark to see if this helps at all. Sorry if this is all over the place, I really just feel lost and have a lot to get off my chest.\* I lost my mother to liver failure around two months ago and I was there when it happened. It was supposed to be a peaceful passing but it was far from that. Hospice came in a started the procedure as usual, but then left and it was just my family and I left to deal with the aftermath. After several hours and multiple instances where we thought we were saying our final goodbyes, she passed. Throughout those several hours, there were multiple occasions were she would cough up blood and would have labored breathing. This has stuck with me ever since. However, recently I've been having these spells of feeling like my heart is stopping and I cant breathe. I felt like I was having a heart attack, and I called an ambulance. I went to a hospital and they told me it was anxiety attack, and that I should seek therapy. I have never had one before and it terrified me. Not only that but they keep happening once or twice a week. I took online school for my high school years and I am very introverted. I have not had a girlfriend yet and I do not drive. I was smoking carts (liquefied THC or marijuana) and it would allow me to focus on a game or show and loose the thoughts of dread for awhile, but I always did it behind my parents and relatives backs. This was before my mothers passing and I would do it at night while I before I would sleep and it would allow me to calm down and relax to fall asleep. After I went to the hospital, I told my father that I was smoking and have been off of it for about a month, which wasn't hard for me to quit but it just made me feel like a failure in his eyes. He was very supportive and understood why, and said that he would do anything I needed to get better and assured me that he was not disappointed. But, I feel like I just added to his grief and things to worry about. On top of everything else, my grandfather died last year and my grandmother died two weeks before my mom did, and no one was able to go visit her in the hospital because we were with my mother. Now, its just me and my father in a apartment that my uncle is paying for and my dad is working a very labor intensive job and he is in his late 50's. He is overweight and has many medical problems such as high blood pressure and needing a knee replacement. He only makes around 200 - 300 dollars a week off his paycheck, and our monthly expenses are triple that. My uncle is helping us for the time being, but he is also in his late 60's. This is causing me to be afraid that I will loose both of them soon too if I don't step in and help. Another thing is I've lost all interest in anything I do. I used to enjoy video games and watching content online and I've come to find that they just make me anxious for some reason, almost uneasy. I have also stopped exercising and going out with friends, and trying to put on a facade when I see them at college once a week (I take two online classes, two on campus). I find myself putting on a select few videos that I have seen before to just drown out the white noise of being awake. I keep having these thoughts that I am behind my peers and it causes me to get angry at myself for slacking all those years away in high school and not trying. My family has been struggling with poverty since I was 7 years old, and I lived in a motel for 8 years of my life. Then we moved in with my grandparents and most of the time, it was fights between my family and my grandparents, causing a sense of hatred for grandparents. We lived out of a single bedroom and bathroom, often resorting to walking around the mall or park for recreation seeing as we didn't have money. Additionally, I was told at the hospital that I also have insomnia and it has become much more prevalent in the past two weeks. I usually fall asleep around 9 am and sleep till around 2 or 3 in the afternoon after being awake for 24+ hours. The doctor prescribed ambien, but I am afraid to take it on the fact that addiction runs on my family. I have been trying Melatonin to no avail, and I just feel lost. My diet has taken a hit as well, and it seems that sometimes I am starving while other times I am overeating. My weight is fluctuating. Her birthday and my parents anniversary are two days after thanksgiving, and Christmas was her favorite holiday so it just seems like I have nothing to look forward too. I have nothing to look forward too anymore, and I feel lost. Schoolwork is SO hard to do, and I often loose focus and motivation all together but somehow I am still getting A's and B's. I just feel like everything is spiraling out of control, and my mind is constantly mush. I don't know what to do. Typing it all out feels a bit better but I feel like this isn't a long term solution, so I was just curious if anyone has gone through the same thing and can give me some incite on how to get my life back on track.",

I've emailed them to let them know that they have the wrong total and that I'm verifying it on my end, the largest amount the gym charges for nsf as far as I understand is 50$, but $825 seems insane. However they just sent me another letter that essentially stated the same number. Also am not sure about the language, this case has already been transferred between representatives for the agency, and the latest stated ""act now to avoid the consequence"" they aren't communicating with me, how should I proceed. *edit 1 So turns out they are charging me for the remainder of the year left on my contract, however this seems very preemptive and out of place, I started in june 2018 so they're adding on each month till june. However, nowhere on the contract does it mention having to pay out the remainder of the year on cancellation or on default. This still seems very out of place contractually. edit 2 So they actually had a second cancellatiOn section I didn't read, however it only applies in a case of cancellation, in that case if you have less than 9 months left of a member ship, you must pay atleast 6 months worth of a membership, and more than 9 months you must pay the full term. However that is only if you cancel the membership in full. So I am likely still on the hook for $200 maybe $400. I really should have read the fine print.",

Does God want or need me in this industry anymore? It's a very specialized work field where experience won't mean anything if I wanted a different career path. Can I work and go to school, and make enough to pay the bills? If not, is school in any capacity an option, so I can further myself and open new opportunities? Is there somewhere, where no school is necessary, but I also have no experience, where God wants me, that I can find that will pay the bills and such, train me, etc., that I can get into? I am 32, and this I the 2nd time in 2 years I've lost a job in this field. Last time I did think about changing careers, but I got back into the field. So I'm all kinds of confused and things are running through my mind. And worst of all, like many others, I have a lot of debt that demands a lot of payments each month, so I'm trying to figure out how to take care of that too. I know God is the ultimate provider, and my trust is that He will not let me down. But with it so fresh in my mind, it's taking a toll on me and I just want some prayers for patience in God's plan and timing, for understanding for the season I'm about to go through, and wisdom for what to do next.

1131,I lost my job today.I lost my job today at a shipping company.

My friend joined immediately and began updating me about how great it was, but peppered amongst the praise was some shady shit. She told me they are made by R+F to edit the after pics for the before and after posts, to make the acne and blemishes less visible. They had a bs explanation for every shady business practice of course. When I told my mom they wanted me to “join their team” and buy the starter pack thing, she immediately told me about how it’s a pyramid scheme etc etc. well I told my friend who already joined that it was a pyramid scheme and I wouldn’t be joining, but I will still support them, like their posts, etc. Next thing I know, the once nice teacher I would babysit for after school everyday was informing me I no longer had a job. Apparently she couldn’t handle me criticizing her “company” and that she didn’t want someone like me working for her. Such a shame because her kids loved me.She used to be so nice and normal, next thing I know she’s acting like a cult member and is firing me for not joining. She used to be so down to earth, and now every post gets tied to her MLM and uses the tag #bossbabe on her fb posts.",

1135,"I lost my job today.I may not really even belong here bc I’m not diagnosed but everyone in this sub seems so supportive and I don’t know where else to post this. I lost my job today because of my illness. It was my dream job, one that I worked my ass off to get. It was crazy intense and long hours and super demanding but I LOVED IT. I wanted to stay there forever. I thought I was going to. I thought that whether I got to stay there forever would be up to me and how hard I worked. I thought that I was the captain of my own ship. But 7 months ago this mystery illness came out of nowhere and knocked me on my ass. My firm had wonderfully generous short term disability benefits, which I know I was extremely lucky to be able to use. But those benefits ran out and I’m still hopelessly sick with no diagnosis and they just can’t wait for me any longer. I know it’s not personal but it still hurts so much. It’s like a part of me died and I’m grieving. I kept hoping that the next doctor appointment I had, or the next blood test, would lead to a diagnosis and a treatment plan that would allow me to get better and drop right back into my life where I left off. But here I am. No diagnosis. No treatment plan. No job. The life I’ve been aching to get back to doesn’t exist anymore and the person I used to be feels like a stranger. Multiple doctors suspect lupus but all my bloodwork continues to come back normal while new fun symptoms like random rashes and eye pain and swelling appear. I feel so hopeless and lost and sad. I don’t believe anyone will ever figure this out. Is it possible I’ve made this all up in my head? Did I do something to cause this? I can’t help but internalize these thoughts. It’s a spiral of mental flagellation. So, that’s my sad rant. Thanks for reading.",

1137,"I just lost my job, I have multiple expenses and I'm completely lostHi all, I don't know what to do at this moment. I'm 51 and for the past 8 years I've been a site director at a manufacturing fortune 500 company with a base of 310,000 + bonus, car salary, stocks, the whole lot. Last year, there was a huge issue at our plant caused by fail in quality that disrupted everyone completely. The GM was replaced, things of the sort (I don't want to go much into detail, incase anyone knows about what I'm talking about). Point is, after that situation, someone was brought in from another state to collaborate with me on the position. And I guess, after a while, he started performing better than I did. When push came to shove, I was given my notice last week. My severance came to just $200,000. My house is paid off, but I have a car loan that's $2,200/month, $160,000, that I got 6 months ago and another loan for a pizza place I opened with a colleague for $80,000. I get an income of $2,500 per month from the pizza place. I give $3,000/month to my mother and father, I have a vacation home for $340,000 I opened at the beginning of this year that pays $2,190/month + $425 HOA, my wife's car is $3,076/month, owes about $40,000. Utilities are about $3,000/month. (Water, electric - $600; security, $70; gym memberships $150; chef, $1,000 + groceries; housekeeper $400; landscape, $200; gas $500). I travel monthly with my wife and spend on budget about $4,000. Our sons' tuition is about $5,000 per semester. The rest would go into savings. My net came down every month to $20,000/month with bonuses of $30-50,000 every spring and I am going nuts with how I won't be getting something even remotely close to that. My retirement balance is at approx. $630,000 and I have about $20,000 in the savings portion of my checking. (It is this low because I shelled out 70,000 for my half of the pizza parlor and for the rest I took out a loan. It's payment is deducted from the income I receive from the it.) This is the first time I have actually tried to look at my current situation because I feel I am on the pit of falling into a horrible depression. I am lost. I don't have an idea on how to see through this situation. All help is greatly appreciated.",

1153,"In 2019 I lost my job, mom got cancer, had major surgery, currently going through a major depressive episode - still sober2019 was a weird year with lots of big downs and big ups. I'm proud to say I did it sober. It wasn't easy and I had a couple of close calls but I got through it. * I lost my job unexpectedly when the startup I worked for ran out of money. I nearly drank that day. Three months later I got a much better job with a 25% raise. The time off in between jobs turned out to be some of the best time I've had in recent memory. * I started 2019 with over 10 grand in credit card debt. I ended it with zero debt and over 9 thousand saved. * My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. It did a number on us, her especially but for the first time I thought I might lose my mom. Thankfully we caught it early, she's already treated it with surgery, radiation, medication and is on the road to recovery. We're closer than we have been in a long time. * An old injury came back to haunt me on a hike, couldn't be repaired this time. Ended up getting a hip replacement 6 weeks ago, currently walking 3 miles a day and on the road to recovery. Planning on doing some long distance bike rides come spring/summer. * I'm dealing with a major depressive episode brought on by my recent surgery, somehow I still get myself to the gym 4-5 times a week and do what I can. I still go to work. I'm working with psychiatrists and therapists to get through this and I have hope. * Bonus, I thought dating sober would be impossible. Not to sound like a tool but I've had more dates, great sex and new experiences with new people in the last two years of sobriety than in all the years before it. But I've come to realize I need to work on myself more before I can put myself in a serious relationship. A goal for 2020. 2020 has its own challenges already. If 2019 proved anything it's that I'm resilient and can get through some tough shit without drinking. I will not drink with you today. Sobriety has and continues to unlock doors that I thought were impossible to open. None of the above would have been possible (my mom's cancer remission being the exception) without me getting sober.",
1154,"Lost my job!First Let’s set the table I work in a trade which requires me to deal with the public. When I was hired on with my now ex employer I asked about the company policy with respect to legal conceal carry. The manager told me “it was against company policy, but as long as he didn’t know about it wink 😉 it was fine”. Fast forward to too days ago I was called into my ex bosses office. He asked me if I was carrying, being honest in nature, and knowing our previous conversations I told him I was. Now I am out of a job. Supposedly a store manager called him and complained. I have carried the same way with the same holster for several years, I don’t print, and I have no idea how this could have happened. P.S I was told later that if I had not admitted that I was currently carrying he could not have searched me or asked me to lift my shirt, and I would have gotten away with it.....at least for the day. Lessons learned #1 If your going to break the rules expect to deal with the consequences. #2 Trust no one!!! #3 some states(mine not being one) have laws which prohibit employers from making rules which conflict with Firearm carry rights. #4 Trust no one!!",

1162,"Lost my job todayI could use advice and moral support. After three months with this company as their IT admin, I was called in for an ""eval"" that asked the usual questions, then was hit with this whopper. They said I had been very reliable and competent, they appreciated all that I had given (quite a few 14-16 hour days), but that the company was moving forward and their original goal of having lots of time to train a guy to be basically the mirror image of their former sysadmin was no longer possible, since they had taken on a new merger and the previous sysadmin could no longer train anyone (he's now the VP of Administration). They also said they saw me working best with other IT professionals in a team, rather than having to be the ""one stop for everything"" guy in a business that otherwise has no IT. They definitely had me as that - I was doing everything from pulling cable to telecom and electrical wiring. When it came to their Ubiquiti equipment and servers, though, they still kept those guarded even though I can work with them perfectly well, and the reason given was that they had had such a lousy history with this position and people leaving the company once they had ""the keys of the kingdom"". I got the usual ""we want to set you free to pursue other opportunities"" (cringe) and ""we'll give you glowing references"" (double cringe). I did my best to get to the bottom of it without making any accusations. They said each time that I did nothing wrong, and any performance issues would have been discussed long before now. So here I am, terminated not-for-cause with three weeks' worth of severance pay and a couple of recommendations. It all happened in a blur. &#x200B; To be honest, I'm not 100% sure what to make of it all. I keep telling myself, if it had been that I was an incompetent slacker, they wouldn't have pulled any punches. But it's hard not to take this personally, and maybe I should. I've reached out to another company that previously extended an offer, and they'd like to talk tomorrow about an open position. &#x200B; How am I supposed to process this?

EP1: “you should just clock out. why are you even here?” so N does go. not home, but to the bathroom to cry. there were the wives of these three disgusting human beings just sitting quietly next to them. not saying ANYTHING. how can someone be so FUCKING MEAN. it’s mind boggling. i probably would have lost my job by saying something equally as entitled to them back, if they said that to me.",

1178,"23 years old: Lost my job in Consulting - seeking advice for landing my dream job in Financial ServicesI recently got laid off from my job in Consulting and have been unemployed since November. I hit the ground running as soon as I was notified and sent out 20+ applications per day for the first couple of weeks. During this period I wasn’t paying much attention to the roles/companies/industries I was applying to because I was embarrassed of my situation and wanted to fix it asap. Since then, I’ve taken a step back to focus on finding out what I really want to do and how I can choose a career path with more conviction this time around (I hated my old job anyway). I’ve been fascinated with investing/finance since childhood (grew up around a lot of successful people in the industry), I follow the markets daily, read financial literature for fun, and have been trading equities (averaging 8-12% YoY returns) since I turned 16. This (among other things) has led me to the conclusion that a career in finance is where I see myself succeeding at something that genuinely interests me. My background: Informatics Major/Finance minor from a public university ranked in the top 15 for undergraduate business/IT programs in the US. After graduation (2018) I took a Big 4 Consulting job doing mostly FP&A Software related work. After a year I took a job at a smaller firm (for a title promotion and better comp) doing similar work, before getting canned. I would really appreciate any advice on how to break into this industry (ideally PE, AM, or VC) but I’m open to any and all suggestions. In addition to tweaking my resume/networking, I’m studying for the CFA in June and working part time for a VC funded startup. However, if you have any other advice for how to spin my story during interviews, maximize downtime, get my foot in the door at these firms, any specific roles to consider, etc. I would really appreciate it. Sorry for the long post and thank you if you’ve even read this far!",

1188,"TIFU because of my cheese addiction and almost lost my jobThis happened a few years back in my early 20's when I was training as a ski rep in the French alps. (Another post just jogged my memory) A group of about a dozen of us were on our last few days of the training course, and I thought it be the best time to break out some booze before our final meal in the accommodation we had. I had gone out and got the cheapest boxes of wine I could find and proceeded to get a little too drunk. More so than everyone else at least. When my boss comes in for dinner, and announces that a VIP well be joining, everyone else sobers up naturally, except me. We sit down at dinner with our unscheduled guests and the first thing that comes out is a massive cheese platter. I grab it from the centre of the table and slam it in front of myself, telling people to ""back off! My cheese now!"" Before shoveling a load of brie in my mouth. I found this hilarious, but the sober version of me knows not to take cheese away from people. I did put it back, eventually, but a little too late. My boss takes me aside the next morning and tells me she was going to send me to one of the best resorts, but after last night was considering firing me. After a lot of apologies, she settles on sending me to a small resort and I got to kick my job. Tl;dr: got stupid drunk before a meal with colleagues. Boss turns up with a VIP, and I steal the cheese platter. Really cheesed off my boss",

1200,"When a LTR isn't worth saving / how much should I sacrifice for him? / Are these actually red flags or not?I'm 23, and I've been in a LTR with my college boyfriend (26) since my sophomore year of college. We have lived together for 2 years, but I am becoming increasingly unhappy because I'm realizing I may have ignored some red flags that are starting to bother me more and more. We have 3 weeks to decide if we are going to renew our apartment lease, and I'm starting to wonder if I need to jump ship. He is handsome, smart, well-educated, funny, and very attracted to me - so that's why up until now I have ignored all of these potential red flags. Here are things I'm only now noticing aren't normal/are bad omens for the traditional life I want: 1. Lack of ambition/goals --- When we first started dating, he just graduated with a prestigious degree and I was still in school. He decided to stay in our small college town to be with me - but was unemployed for those whole 2 years despite being intelligent and having an advanced degree. At first I chalked it up to there being so few jobs in the college town, but even to this day since we've moved, he only has a very low paying job and no real concrete plans/ambitions other than ""find something better."" Right now, I have a decent job and I pay 60% of our rent. His degree is in a very niche science field, so I can understand why finding work is hard. But he doesn't have plans to go back to school or anything like that. I'm worried I will always have to have my same stressful career to make ends meet. 2. Up until 2 weeks ago, I had to drive him to/from work every day because he didn't have a car. I never heard a thank you. He recently bought a car (thank goodness) but I am starting to realize this isn't normal...and may have made me respect him less. He also never once offered to pay for gas. I think he really takes my giving nature for granted. Him buying a car is step in the right direction - I'm hoping it helps him branch out and also feel like he can find a better job too. 3. Evasive about future --- While he does hold very traditional beliefs about morality and society, whenever I ask about marriage and kids, he says ""I want that life someday, but I don't have any money and I can barely plan a week in advance."" I know he isn't cheating on me or looking for something better (it would take way too much time to explain why, I just know for a fact he is very, very loyal). It really is a matter of him not having direction in life - but what if this never changes? I've expressed how important this is to me so it's not a lack of communicating what I need, either. 4. He doesn't prioritize me or our relationship - he never takes me out (in fact, we haven't gone on a date in over a year), surprises me with anything, and never goes out of his way to make me feel loved/special. Partly because his job is tiring and he's very anti-social and reserved - but even when he was unemployed and had all the free time in the world he didn't. I recently told him that we need to put more effort into the relationship, and he wasn't thrilled about the idea of having to leave the house to go to a restaurant or museum - which made me a bit hurt. 5. When I bring up issues (which is hard for me, I'm quiet and not confrontational), he gets defensive and refuses to really discuss things in a healthy way. Our difficult conversations usually turn into me giving up and not pressing the issue. He later apologizes for this, but we still don't really resolve the issue. 6. He blames the world for his problems. He blames the screwed up university system, the job market that prioritizes women - all valid claims, but he doesn't ever take into account how maybe he contributed to some of his failures. I find this to be a little immature. Overall he has a very inflated view of himself, which I think is a defense mechanism. &#x200B; The reason I've held on for so long is because we really do get along so well - and that's no easy feat, considering we're both really weird and have a hard time making friends and finding significant others who put up with our respective quirks. I start to think maybe I need to hold on while he figures out his career, finances, and all of that -- because he is a very loyal person who shares my worldview, and I could see him being a great father one day. It's hard, because for every concern I have about his potential red flags, I can see the problem from his perspective. I think I may be too close to him to see things objectively. Also, I haven't dated since I was 19 - and I know it's very hard to find a man willing to settle down in the way we have. I know there are so many players out there, and one great thing about our relationship is I have never had to worry about his love or commitment. Yes, he could do more for me and be more romantic - but at the end of the day he makes it very clear he loves me and doesn't want to be with anyone else. But maybe those are just words? I am still very naive about this sort of thing. Another thing to mention is I am pretty lonely - I have only a couple friends in this city we live in (by his choice), and all my dearest friends live in other states. I would be ok with this if I felt more nurtured by my relationship - but if he can't even take me on a date once a week, I feel like I'm just very isolated and lonely. Part of me wants to move closer to my best friends and start over completely because I'm not getting the social life I need in this current town or from my boyfriend. I know for a fact I'd live in the ugliest, worst city in the world if it was with a husband I loved dearly, but at this rate....maybe I shouldn't sacrifice my social life for a man who might not marry me. I don't want to lose 3 years of love if these issues can be fixed, and maybe I need to stick with him and give him the confidence to keep pushing forward. I'm very worried that if I break up with him I will regret it forever. But I am also worried that I could lose my whole youth to a man who won't grow up. Any advice and experience would be greatly appreciated. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ # An update for anyone interested ---- After being inspired by all of these responses, I decided all I could do was sit him down and tell him everything (nicely). I explained that while I am lonely in this city, I am willing to stick it out if 1) we start spending more quality time together outside of the house, and 2) If he really is in it for the long-haul, even if he doesn't have a specific timeline marriage and kids just yet. I just need to know he's all in, and that he wants to try to make it work. Because if I'm just a convenient option, I need to know so I can move on even though I don't want to. ( I didn't say it that harshly). I was hoping for (but knew this wouldn't happen) him to be so scared of losing me that he'd promise to work harder on our future with me. But instead he sat there for a long time and basically said ""I have no idea what I want. I can't think or plan that far ahead because I don't know what I'm doing."" And I said ""I know, I understand that, but do you WANT to get married some day? do you WANT to find a job you really like and start moving forward?"" And again more silence. He said ""Yes, I think getting married would great. But how can I commit to anything when the future is so vague?"" So I got the answers I was expecting exactly. He was visibly upset and went to bed before we could talk more. When he gets home from work today I plan on explaining how I need to move out, but it doesn't necessarily mean we have to break up for good. I will see how he responds to that whole thing. Because clearly he isn't saying ""no I never want to marry you"" but he isn't saying ""yes, let's make this happen, I know it's something you want and need and I will give it to you somebody and be excited about it."" Instead he seems like he'd be happy to string me along for 10 years while he figures it out. I know everyone is different, but I keep thinking of my friends who got married dirt poor at 24, still in college, and how they've stuck it out and supported each other built an awesome life together with a house and children only 5 years later. While I know men like to secure money and a career before marriage, I feel like he might put it off indefinitely since he doesn't seem to have specific goals or be that worried about losing me. I'm trying to give him SOME of the benefit of the doubt, since I feel like I owe him that. But I think me leaving, even just temporarily, could inspire him to take action. Thank you all so much for your advice. It really inspired to do this, which I've been avoiding for 3 months now.",
1201,"Navigating first month of living together and his busyness * What is the problem, and what do you think is the root of the issue? I have recently moved into my boyfriend's studio apartment, we're both mid 20s, I'm in the middle of a job search, he's still in school. We are on the waiting list for a bigger apartment, which should take a few more months, however as this is the first time we're cohabiting I want us to start off on the right foot; this has proven trickier than I anticipated. That is because this month coincides with him being very stressed and busy with a very important project at university; he is a very ambitious, hardworking and smart man, however he is also a procrastinator, so he needs the pressure of a tight deadline to really give his all. Now that he does have a tight deadline, his project has taken priority over anything in his life, including our relationship. I appreciate him making room in his place for me, and he appreciates my physical presence at his place (one of the main reasons he wanted me to move in was to have this guaranteed sense of physical closeness/knowing we will fall asleep next to each other at night, which I find very heartwarming). However, there have been some tensions which I feel are causing my not-so-best-self to come out lately. For example, I have noticed that even though we split the grocery bill, he eats two thirds more than what I eat - this has resulted in me spending more on food than usual, while eating less. Not sure how to navigate this, as I also currently have a slightly higher income than him, so I feel like it would be stingy to ask him to pay most; however, it's not exactly pleasant to come home at night and find that he's eaten through most of the food. There have been no date nights, as he said he doesn't have time, even if I suggest something - however if his friends ask, he is always up for going with them. Last week, we had a date set up, but then he decided to go there with his male friend, and upon realizing he was supposed to go with me, he also invited me along, but it made me feel uncomfortable and as if I was interrupting their 'guy time'. His male friends also follow TRP, and have in the past mocked him for being with me, as they perceive me as 'locking him down' before he can live out his youth and bachelorhood. He has defended me, as he is a family-minded man, but also appreciates TRP's self-improvement mentality. Regarding household, he doesn't do the dishes, or the laundry. I tried asking him, and he postponed it until he forgot about it. Now, I would be fine with temporarily taking over these chores, but I don't want him to come to take it for granted - so I am not sure how much of these chores I should do. &#x200B; * How have you contributed/attempted to mitigate the problem? There have been instances where I came across as nagging and upset - which I really, really, do not want to be, but in order not to be that way I feel like need him to keep at least *some* of his 'boyfriend' duties (dates or sex or being generous, anything that can help put me in a submissive mood). We have never argued - and I try not to show my resentment, but there have been times when I had to go to the bathroom to cry because it got too much. I do cook sometimes - but not each day, as sometimes the pile of dishes he makes is so large that it just totally puts me off, and the only way to not get angry and resentful is to ignore it. When I do cook, I make nutritious meals that he really enjoys. I've done his laundry last week, which he loved, and called me 'wife material', but still he apologized that I had to do it (we live in a very feminist country and it's expected to share these chores equally). I'm not sure if I should do it again this week? Sex and BJs are on tap - however he doesn't take up on the offer so often anymore, and I have tried initiating last week, but was met with rejection - which despite being polite and apologetic, still hurt me a lot. We are usually a very sexual couple and I am the only woman he can finish with - so it is a blow to my ego to see our frequency go from daily/every other day to once/twice a week. However, I figured it's a bigger blow to his ego to have to turn down sex, so now I try to not pressure him sexually but still be flirty/charming when we hang out at home. I have tried keeping more busy, as my friends have the feeling that he is taking me for granted since I seem to be waiting on him hand and foot. I am active, and go to the gym to keep in shape. We used to go together, but his TRP friends 'stole' him from me and he's changed gyms to work with them instead. Generally, I try to do interesting stuff during the day so that we have stuff to discuss when he comes home. Despite these little problems, he is a great person and we both want to make this work in the long run - he seems to be unbothered by most of the issues above, and keeps talking of our future, when we will go on dates, and holidays, and we'll both have awesome careers etc. Which makes me hopeful that this is only temporary. Technically, it is two more weeks until his deadline. So I am really hoping that all these issues are temporary and will get better when he ends this project - but what if it continues beyond that? As the partner of someone who is growing towards a high-stakes career, I want to show him that I can add value to his life when he's busy. &#x200B; * What is your current relationship status and length of time? We have known each other for almost two years, and have been together since last autumn. Our values and aspirations align pretty well, and I have a lot of respect for him and his ambitions, as he inspires me to step up and improve myself, too. I have met his family and extended family, and he has expressed that this is a serious monogamous relationship to him and that once we get somewhat secure and established in our careers, he would like to start a family together. I would love to hear stories of ladies who've gone through similar struggles/how you solved it, all advice and perspectives are welcome!",
1202,"Fighting very hard against depression and trying not to give into suicidal urges. I've been using weed to ignore my problems and numb myself but I think I need to stopI don't think I can solve them but the only way there's even a 0.1% chance of me solving my problems is if I address them and I can't do that while high. Feels like I can't even remember anything of the last 3 years because I spent them always stoned out of my mind. All I remember is the intermittent periods of sobriety as absolute misery.

Recently My friends have stopped inviting me to stuff (which could be my fault for never reaching out), and it’s hard to connect with them because they are all stoners and I recently quit.

I just refused to stop when my boyfriend stopped. He has a year clean. Then things weren’t going well with him and it’s really been a super shitty year with so much going on. On a whim I took a dog sitting gig in France and have my 30 day plan. Today is just 36 hours since my last drink. But I had gotten to the point that I was making more excuses. I even stocked up. Who know how much wine I had my first three days here. But yesterday I was sullenly not feeling well and had to vomit. The only thing that came out was wine. I’ve been ignoring this far too long and I’m hoping to mend some of relationships I’ve messed up along the way. IWNDWYT",

1223,"Sep 8th, 3 a.m.: A crushing pain in my chest. I'm struggling to catch a breath. 7 hours later I got a diagnose: suspicion of a heart attack. I'm 28. I was never scared so much in my life. Jan 6th: after 10 years of ignoring my problems, I started to rebuild myself. These are my results.[*Cross post (from 9 months ago).*](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/9xor1h/method_sep_8th_3_am_a_crushing_pain_in_my_chest/) &#x200B; **September 2017** I am 28, the age when I should become a stable pillar of my family. But a single look at my bank account shows a brutal truth. Dozens of self-help books, how-to blog posts, TED talks and hundreds of dollars spent on workshops were just cowardly escapes from solving the real problem. Me. * I'm the one looking at all seasons of Rick and Morty in one seating instead of getting out of debts. * I'm the one acting busy 24/7 and producing zero meaningful results. * I'm the one living of my family's support. * I'm the one browsing Reddit until 4 am only to wake up for lunch. * I'm the one whose the most intense physical performance is going to piss. I got the reality check. After ten years I moved back to my parents' house. For the next three months I was glad to be alive. Fortunately, I have a friend /u/martincharvat (old username /u/ch4rvi). Martin is 31, and his girlfriend pays all his expenses. I like him. He is a loser, just like me. On February 14th he invited me to a Google Spreadsheet. We started strictly tracking accountability of what we do. Day by day. For eleven months. These are our results: **November 2018** *Me* * Since January 6th, I walk 5-10 km (3-6 miles) every day. I'm able to do heavy work on our garden again. Since September 9th I started to practice Ashtanga yoga 5 times a week for 60 minutes a day. * Since February 26th I design one t-shirt a day. Now, more than 300 designs generate me $1,000 a month. * Since March 28th, I take the coldest shower possible for two minutes as the first thing after waking up. I feel like a terminator. Suddenly I'm not sick when someone just sneezes around me. * Since June 14th I wake up at 6 am every day even on weekends. And since October 4th at 5 am. It adds me 3 productive hours a day. * Since October 4th I don't use the internet or any other digital technology for procrastination and escape. It tripled my productivity to 7 hours. * Since July 21st, after ten years, I overcame my fear of driving. Now I drive to the yoga lectures two times a week. * Last eight years I was becoming the forever alone meme. On July 13th Martin challenged me to ask three random girls I never met out. Face to face obviously. Tinder or anything digital would count as cheating. On October 19th I overcame my biggest fear of rejection and I asked a girl I met in my yoga class out. There was no need to ask another one because we are dating since then. *Martin* * Since July 18th he lost 10 kg (22 pounds) of weight. * Since February 14th every morning after waking up he practices the cold shower as well, and he hasn't been sick since then. Now in the autumn he wears just a t-shirt wherever he goes (no matter how cold is out there). Still not sick. * Since March 16th he invested hundreds of hours (lots of days 6 hours a day) to learn how to draw with deliberate practice. * Since July 14th he wakes up at 6 am and from September 28th at 5 am, every single day even on weekends. * Since October 8th he doesn't use the internet or digital technology for procrastination, only for production and solving problems. Now he has more time for work and for quality time with his family and friends. I do still have debts, I still live with my parents, but I'm slowly taking the responsibility of myself. Martin's girlfriend still pay his expenses. But after more than ten years we both have the path which can get us out of the rabbit hole. A year ago it seemed impossible. We have tested habits that lead us to these results. And we have a working method how to stick with them day by day. It worked for us, it works for our family members, and now we are curious if it can work for people we don't know personally. We don't offer overnight success. We are not launching the next cool app from Silicon Valley. We are two guys from Czechia (Europe) getting out of a pond of shit where we stuck over the last ten years. Day by day we support each other to stay on the right path. If you want to join us, PM me what are your pitfalls and what you want to be. We won't charge you anything. But it won't work unless you will.",
1228,"ASUS is ignoring my problem, maybe some of the users of /r/Corsair will know a fix? CH7 BIOS bugged with regard to Corsair h150i. Alternatively, who should I buy from instead of ASUS next time?Here's what I posted to /r/ASUS, maybe you guys would have some insight or suggestions on a workaround. --- First and foremost let me congratulate those of you who aren't experiencing this problem, I envy you. I only write this because most often the first response to this problem is ""Well I'm not experiencing that!"" and while that is wonderful, and I really do feel great for you, it just isn't helpful. Anyway, ever since BIOS 1103 my Crosshair VII has experienced a bug in which the Corsair h150i will repeatedly connect and disconnect while I'm using my computer. This is not a problem on Corsair's end, as downgrading my BIOS to 1002 makes the problem go away. I am running the latest version of iCUE, I have the latest firmware installed on my pump, I have tried powering down and unplugging it, none of those have made a bit of difference; the only thing that solves the problem is rolling my BIOS back to 1002. Upgrading to any BIOS newer than 1002 results in the connect/disconnect problem. I'd like to upgrade to Ryzen 3000 when it comes, but I can't do that if I'm stuck on a year old BIOS. I'd really rather not replace my motherboard when the time comes, I spent quite a bit of money on this board with the assumption that it would be upgradable, but I can't upgrade as long as this bug persists. Please fix this bug. I'm not the only one experiencing it, and we've been begging for a fix since November 2018, so far ASUS hasn't acknowledged the problem or done anything to solve it. If this problem persists until the Ryzen 3000 release I will have no other choice but to buy one of your competitor's products, and to encourage others to do the same, which is not something I want to do. Please fix this bug. It has survived for more than six months and it's time to quash it.",
1229,"I have no idea what to do. Ignore my problems and stay happy?We've been married 10.5 years. The first year was rough due to a cancer diagnosis he had, there was no sex. He took a job where he traveled for long periods of time, I cheated, and promised to to be a better wife which I've fulfilled. He gets diagnosed with cancer again, meets a girl 17 years younger and begins a sexual relationship with her. I was destroyed when I found out, but we were entering a point in our lives with jobs where things could be really good for us. I discovered he's been paying her bills about $3k total the past four months. This girl has sent me harassing messages calling me a whore when I demanded they break things off. We tried marriage counseling a couple of months ago, but it really looked bad for me to leave during work. Then the counselor said we were too complex and brushed us off onto another lady. I'm thinking of finally filing for divorce in the morning but feel so shitty because we've fought through 3 rounds of cancer together, finally graduated and landed our dream jobs. He agrees to go to an outpatient rehab for some emotional things he has going on. I don't know how to trust him yet again, but I don't want to start dating and feel discouraged that a divorce will set me back with my MBA program I start in January. Work is going so well too, and I'm afraid the emotional toll will turn everything upside down that's going well. If I ignore the problem we are happy, but I know I can't trust him.

1230,"MoviePass Continues to Ignore My Problems. Now 12 Days Since I've Been Able to Use My AccountI have been experiencing several problems that MP has either been unable/unwilling to solve. I migrated my account to the yearly plan nearly two months ago and I'm still paying the monthly. An email back in December promised to both solve this problem and refund me. To this time no such refunds have been made. The more serious issue is that I cannot watch any movies on the plan, as my account shows 'past due.' I did update my card on file and attempted to enter chat with them. I've been waiting more than a week for response. When I finally got a number, I called on Tuesday; the CSA assured that while she could not charge my account (huh?) that her manager would be able to fix this. Again I was promised prompt results. Today (Thursday) I called again. Was told no one took care of my issue. Again, I was promised prompt results and refunds for each month since I migrated. I'm calling again on Friday but it's clear that no changes have been made. My MP debit card still shows as Processing, no refunds have been made, and I still cannot watch a movie with this plan.

Hi, I've been using Sonic Studio III and it was working fine, but recently (last 3 or 4 months ) I noticed that most of my apps became so slow (like firefox, spotify, chrome ...) they hake ages to start. I found that NAHIMIC service is causing the issue. So, I did contact ASUS support @ [https://www.asus.com](https://www.asus.com/), then I got an answer from one of the team of advisors ASUS, He said that the product is made only to the following computers: GL12CS, GL504GM, GL504GS, GL704GM, GL704GW, GX531GM, which obviously doesn't make any sense, because it's advertised in their website that ROG X HERO does support SONIC STUDIO III, plus it was working and now all of a sudden is not supported? and I can't any official statement that says so, right?, so I told him that, again he denies without any further explanation?!!! then I said to myself maybe he is not aware of the issue, so I asked him to forward my question to developers or technical support because the app is packages with the audio driver from ASUS website Win10 x64 if he doesn't have much info -which is totally normal!!- I'm a developer at the end of the day and I can understand if it is a bug, in fact I wanna report bugs, that's what we do!! but guess what answer I got from him : ""We are delighted that the problem is resolved. Thank you for choosing our service and I wish you a good day."" I can't see why he is delighted!! he didn't answer any question I asked him: &#x200B; * The app was working, and now it is not!! * Why the app is not supported anymore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! * If, so why ASUS is still advertising that ROG X Hero supports it, is it a scam? I bought this MB for the premium features after all!!!! * If the app is not supported, why it is packaged with the audio driver!!! Win10 x64 Version 6.0.1.8507 2018/09/28 from the date it is obviously that the driver is out of date, and if you do a little research you can clearly see that A LOT OF people facing the same issue which I told him btw!! Conclusion: this situation is ridiculously stupid, I've always believed that ASUS has great hardware, I wish they put the same effort for their software and support as well!! If you have a solution or clarification to the issue, please do not hesitate to help, thanks.",

1245,"I have a problem with ignoring my problems or working all my problems until I no longer have to face themGrowing up, my parents never showed me how to really solve my problems. I've never seen them fight every time I would try to solve a problem they would just tell me to stop being dramatic. In school I was pretty well-behaved, I got good grades, played 3 sports and participated in many clubs. Well, now I'm an adult and sometimes it seems like I just can't face real life problems or I can't form connections with people. Most times I would just keep myself occupied with lots of hobbies and now I keep myself occupied with 3 jobs and being in the military. I have this weird mindset that I have to be busy all the time because I think it helps me ignore the problems I have in my personal life. This has been affecting my life negatively and it's been causing me to strain a lot of my personal relationships with people. In my last relationship, it was really hard for me to not let my emotions take over the reality that our relationship had problems even though I pretended that we didn't have any. Sometimes I can face a problem but I don't like to live in reality sometimes. I don't know how to conquer my problems step-by-step and it's ruining my life. Is anyone else like this?

Seriously, I feel not ready at all to deal with adult life, and my anxiety is reaching extreme levels. I dealt with this before simply by ignoring my problems altogether, which bought me blissful everyday life but at the cost of it all catching up to me at once. I can’t, but I want to have a little break on all of those things for a while. I have absolutely zero idea on what I want to do on the future or if I could ever deal with the extra baggage of adult life. I’ve friends, but none the type that know or want to deal with emotional stuff, I’m very much the same, but I just can’t escape from it. Anyways in the end I just felt like sharing my problems somewhere, I don’t know what answer to expect and I know myself that the questions I’m dealing with right now should have been dealt with a long time ago, it’s the rant of an eighteen year old and I’m sure my problems are at most minor on comparison to what other people have to struggle through.

1248,"I'm really struggling with getting work done for school. I have a very bad habit of trying to ignore my problems when I feel frustrated and pressured to the point where I don't really have a life right now. Has anyone who has successfully overcome this have some solid advice?Alright, I'm at the end of my rope and could really use some advice. I'm using a throwaway so I can discuss this openly. I have friends who also read Reddit. For several years I've struggled with being able to sit down and do the work I need to do, whether for school or just taking care of personal business. For example, if I have a project in one of my classes I start working on it, get frustrated, and I drop it until the last minute. I know everyone struggles with some form of procrastination to some degree, but for me, it has been getting worse over time, to the point where I'm not really functional anymore. Anytime I have work to do with school, which is pretty much always, it consumes my thoughts until I get it done. There will be days when I'm too frustrated to work on my project, but I don't do anything else that's productive out of guilt. The entire day gets wasted. I'm nearing the end of my college degree and I want to change now before I waste anymore of my life. Some background info that may be useful: when I was a teenager there was a lot of turmoil at home. The details are not important to the post, but suffice it to say, it was bad enough that I often felt the need to ""unplug"" myself from life so that I could deal with what was going on with my parents. Typically this meant playing video games, watching TV, reading news articles, or other similar passive activities that I would use as a form of escapism. That actually worked out well for me at the time. The problem is that because I did it up until I moved away from home for college, I developed some pretty bad habits. Now, everytime I work on something and I start to get frustrated I get a really intense urge to drop it and ""unplug"" myself from my problems. I also turn to self criticism and feel bad that it takes me longer to figure stuff out than other students in the class. Overall the experience is very furstrating and mentally exhausting. If anyone has struggled with a similar problem and has overcome it, I would love to hear from you. I've tried really hard to get over this problem on my own, but I have been unsuccessful so far. I think it's time that I get some outside help, but I'm not sure where to look. And please: if your only response to my post is some varient of ""get over it"" save yourself the time of posting it. I've been telling myself to just ""get over it"" for several years now and trying to dismiss the problem like that hasn't helped. I really need some specific advice.",

1254,"Going to the doctor tomorrow, after years of ignoring my problem. Here's my story.Depression is quite a stigma for me. My father made us miserable and ended up dying because of it, my mother suffers depression too. I usually can't even admit I have a problem. I went to therapy for over 10 years, from teenager to my 30s, I'm 39 now. My psychologist was really good, he made me think a lot about many issues I have, my childhood and adolescence wasn’t exactly a fairy tale. After relocating to the other end of the world I don’t have my psychologist anymore, but in any case I don’t think I have much more to do there, I have the tools to think about me and my problems now. Only twice in my life I took medication, in my early 20s and in my early 30s, both times after breaking up with a girlfriend and having a huge crisis. But I hate taking medication, maybe because of the stigma, maybe because I saw my father medicated like a zombie, maybe because the side effects are really bad in my case (crappy sex life, not being able to think or focus, terrible physical performance at the gym or even climbing stairs, etc.) I have managed to have a quite successful life, but miserable at the same time. I have a master degree, a good job, a wife, a baby coming soon… But I graduated 10 years older than my peers, and I keep lagging. My symptoms come and go in cycles, my most common problems are: * Procrastinating absolutely everything. The most insignificant tasks get overwhelming. I can’t get out of bed in the morning, or I skip brushing my teeth at night because it’s a burden to do it. * Anguish and anxiety for no particular reason * Panic attacks about being sick * Panic to die, even of old age, that I can’t shake out of my head * Delusional tactics to live forever (I keep in touch with reality, but I can’t bear the truth so I get into life extension stuff and other illusions) * Compulsively doing things like watching a TV series for days, episode after episode without being able to stop. Other times it’s non-stop working, a random new hobby, etc. * I manage to take the joy out of my activities. This one sucks big time. I for example play volleyball but usually I can’t enjoy it, as I’m not very good in sports I’m always pushing myself, training really hard, then quitting frustrated when I don’t become a super star. * Problems socializing, I can’t make friends and I feel really lonely. I relocated 3 years ago, no new friends yet. * Feelings of frustration, anger, and violence towards minor things, or even things that happened many years ago. I revive inside my head some past frustrating episodes over and over, being unable to shake them out. I’m telling all this to the doctor tomorrow, and I think I’m going to need medication again, even if I’m not having a huge crisis now. Well, I haven’t been able to work for months, but I don’t think I’m losing my job anyway, but what could I accomplish if I can be consistent, when even being a mess I’m quite successful? Why can’t I just be happy even when everything is fine? I’m not enjoying life, that’s terrible! Also, our baby is coming soon, I want to give my kids a stable home and I won’t forgive myself if I repeat what my home did to me. I think that’s all for now. Thanks for reading, if you have any questions, suggestions, whatever, go ahead and write. TL;DR Read the fucking thing or just go to r/aww instead, this is serious stuff :)",

1270,"My Addiction & Recovery from IV tianeptineHey guys I'm new around here but I just wanted to throw my story out there if anything I say can maybe help another person. A few years back I was heavily addicted to tianeptine. I used daily for approx 3 years. By my 2nd year I was completely ready to quit however I wasn't sure how to go about it. I was too afraid to ask for help I did not want to lose the respect of my friends and family and I did not want my wife or kids to abandon me. The one thing that addiction does is it creates false fears and denies us the ability to see life clearly. Trying to make decisions about sobriety when you're addicted is incredibly difficult. I attempted multiple times to get clean on my own and would make it a day or 2 with the help of benzos, gabapentin, and other help-aids for comfort. But I would eventually always relapse. By my 3rd year I was using 10-20g daily IV. I know that probably sounds like an extreme amount and I realize that it is but my addiction had grown extremely severe. By the 3rd year I was so lost and so heavily addicted I didn't feel like I would ever escape. The addiction separated and isolated me so that I began to feel like I was the only one that understood what was happening. I feared if I came clean about my addiction I would lose my family, my career, my friends, and of basically everything important to me. Addiction lies to you to keep you. I also greatly feared that there would be no rehab, detox, or hospital that would help me and provide some comfort why I went through wds. I had already come to the conclusion that wd from this amount was impossible on my own. Unfortunately I continued in isolation and abuse till the point that it got so bad and so many things had happened in my life that were unexplainable, bad luck didn't cut it as an excuse anymore. One day things happened and my addiction was finally exposed. I wound up in the ER in and out of conciousness. When I was conscious I was very confused. Once I finally began to stabilize I gave in and confessed my addiction. The wd was of such extreme that I had to be admitted to the ICU on IV sedatives and benzos. They also put me on a high dose of methadone daily. After spending approx 10 days in the hospital I was released home. At home detoxed off the methadone cold Turkey. After living the addicted life so long I felt abnormal and incomplete without an opiate in my system. Also while using I had a tendency to ignore my problems but once I became sober they were all right there waiting for me. I tried to stay clean but I never really had anything in my life to support or help me in that venture. My wife was very supportive but did not understand what addiction was and how hard the battle could be. I attended Drug Addicts Anonymous meetings a few times but I never read the book or worked the steps. I eventually relapsed on heroin. I had made a decision that I would never touch tianeptine again and so instead I turned to heroin. My heroin dose rose rapidly till I was on a very high dose. I eventually decided that I was done and wanted to live a life of sobriety and devotion to my family. I withdrew from heroin cold turkey at home for 4 days. While the wd sucked it was nothing compared to tianeptine wd. After 4 days I checked into a detox/rehab. I Had the privilidge of getting into an inpatient rehab for 30 days. It was absolutely life changing being able to meet with counsellers, teachers, and other addicts. Without that 30 days I don't know that I would be sober right now. Once leaving rehab I had began to attend drug addicts anonymous meetings weekly, read the big book, and get a sponsor and support system. I'm currently working the steps and honestly believe if it wasn't for rehab and DAA I probably would have relapsed already. Right now I feel like a brand new person with a brand new chance at life. I won't lie the fight for sobriety at times can be tough but this life is a 1000 times better then the life of addiction. Addiction can take you to a very dark place. It lies to you and tells you there's no hope and no one that will help you. It creates deep seated fear in you that if you come clean you will lose your wife, your family, your career, your friends, and so forth. When you're living with an addicted brain and constantly Intoxicating yourself it's very hard to see clearly enough to make the right decisions. When you feel overwhelmed, in a dark place, anxious, hopeless, how can you expect to see clearly that there is hope and there is light. You can't. But you have to trust that if you will ask for help then help will find you. There are so many addicts today that are clean who once sat in your place. The one thing that brought a new ray of hope into their life was simply asking for help.",
1271,"[26F, 5'6"" 190lbs] How do you replace food when it is a main source of comfort and self-soothing?For the past 4.5 years, I have yo-yoed through losing and gaining the same \~15 lbs. I am now a few lbs short of being back to my highest weight. I love food and I love eating. Eating excessive amounts of garbage is common when I am stressed or bored and I want to escape and ignore my problems. Even when I'm not as stressed, my eating habits tend to revolve around getting carbs and cheese into my body with the least amount of effort possible. I also love to reward myself with food or use it as a motivator to get out of the house and do errands or other activities. A lot of aspects of weight loss are challenging for me, but I think giving up food as a source of comfort wears down on my willpower the most. Feeling hungry all the time in stressful. Ignoring cravings is stressful. Resisting tasty food that others are enjoying is stressful. Being in a bad mood from all this stress, and worrying about being grumpy with other people, is stressful! I'm looking for strategies others have used in this situation. How do you cope with all of the stress of weight loss without relying on food? Is there something I can actually replace food with as a source of comfort? Are there any methods to helping me not feel so much stress about this? Is the only solution to just suffer and tough it out? (I really hope it's not)",

1275,"Medical problem I can probably ignore while I finish my PhD? Or something I should take seriously?Hi Doctors of reddit, thanks in advance for any opinions. This is a pooping one so turn away if squeamish! Bio: 29 yo female, 120lbs, 5ft3 Healthy apart from chronic migraine diagnosis, no history of GI issues. Meds: naproxen, triptans and domperidone for acute treatment, aimovig and amitriptyline as preventatives. Cerazette as contraceptive which means I haven't had a period in 3+ years. On Tuesday I had an episode of the most extreme stomach pain (generally in abdominal area, but then seem to move lower almost like period cramps), was worst on the right side. I would rate the pain as the same I give migraines that are 9/10. Lasted all night and was violently sick 5+ times, I felt such intense crazy pressure I honestly felt like something was going to rupture. Had normal BM at somepoint (although this triggered another wave of vomiting). There was a lot of undigested food in my vomit (including breakfast which I'd eaten around 10 hours earlier). Over the next couple of days I still had dull aching, again had normal BM, but streaked with red blood (definitely not from an anal fissure as I could kind of see it came from further up). Had three days of no pooping follow this, despite trying senna, glycerin suppositories, magnesium citrate and domperidone. Finally went today after having a sachet of movicol- not painful at all but a lot more red blood this time, which came out after the initial BM :/ Right now I have dull aching low down and my stomach muscles feel exhausted. Should I be worried? My initial theory is peptic ulcer (but I'm not a clinician and GI is definitely not my area!) As I said in the title, I'm submitting my PhD in the next couple of months and really want to ignore this for now. It sucks to finally have control over chronic migraine to then develop this new issue!",

1277,"Not drinking is AWESOME (today is day 4)I thought I hit rock bottom last February. I was on a work trip and got so drunk I ended up in the ER. Luckily I was by myself and didn't miss any meetings (though I came dangerously close to missing a deadline and I'm still amazed I got away with it) so my work never found out. Unfortunately I got hit with $4000 ambulance and hospital bill that I'm still paying off. After that humiliating event I was sober for about a month before I decided I could handle a drink once in a while. Well one drink here and there quickly became 2 or more (often more) a night with frequent bingeing. I have been saying for months that I'm going to sober up... tomorrow. But tomorrow never came. So last week I decided this is it, February 1 I'm going sober - and I decided to celebrate it by spending Friday night shitfaced in public and making an ass of myself. But I did it! Saturday I spent the day nursing a hangover and dealing with the humiliation and anxiety from the night before. But as much as I wanted to drink to make it all go away, I didn't. I spent the day wallowing in self pity and then I picked myself back up, dusted myself off, and moved on with my life. Sunday I woke up early, feeling refreshed and ready to face the day (an unusual feeling for me). I cooked breakfast, went grocery shopping, did a ton of laundry and cleaned the house. I don't watch football so luckily the Superbowl wasn't any type of temptation. I got to bed at a reasonable hour - another unusual thing for me, I'm usually up half the night drinking and hating myself - and I woke up early the next day to make the bed and have breakfast before work. I've been getting myself into a routine that's much more healthy and normal than the torture I was putting myself through before in order to ignore my problems. I've been eating better since I'm not too drunk or tired to cook. I have more energy than ever, I'm sleeping well... I can't believe it took me this long to make this change in my life! Once I get more into the routine I'd like to add exercise into the mix since I think that will help me a lot with my depression and anxiety - at the very least it'll be more helpful than alcohol ever was.",

I know that I can be quiet and shy, and I have tried to break this since and done a lot better since graduating college.

My manager already seems nice so I just don’t want my shyness to ruin this opportunity for me and I was going to ignore my problem and just face my fears and go in on Monday, but I think it’s best to have a little preparation instead of ignoring my fears!

1280,"AITA for not wanting to spend time with my family after they’ve ignored all the problems I’m having so they could punish me?(Before we get into this I’m 16) So semi-recently my best friend who I’ve known since birth and has been in my house every week for 16 years had to move 16 hours away (by car) I was clinically diagnosed with depression, and I have pretty bad anxiety. My best friend moved, and I don’t know when I’ll be seeing him again, my girlfriend left me, and my bike broke. (I was really into riding BMX) my parents thought it’d be soooo cool to “brag” that they could easily fix my bike, but don’t want to/didn’t have to/ I didn’t deserve it or something. The timeline: My parents decided that they wanted to take my 3 year old sister to Disney world (funny, no one EVER wanted to take me to Disney world when I was younger)my best friend was supposed to come on this trip, but suddenly no one could afford to pay for a ticket OR pay for the trip after promising to do so, so I went to Disney world with my family. (It wasn’t fun, my mom whined about the heat the whole time) After that I crashed my bike and got a concussion and dislocated a shoulder, my bike was and is still broken by the crash. That was how I got to school. Due to missing school for a trip, and now being extremely tired all the time because I have to get up earlier to walk a couple miles to school, my grades fell. My parents took everything, my computer, my phone(the only way to communicate with my friend) my social life was taken as well. (No friends, not allowed to leave house unless I’m going to school, or family time etc.) Now fast forward to today, my grades are okay, but I still don’t have any of my things (no ones home right now so I have my phone for “emergencies”) My parents go out on all sorts of adventures but seem confused when I don’t want to come, or when I don’t want to be with them at all. They’ve ignored my depression, anxiety, and problems in my life. I don’t feel like I should have to be with them, and it makes me sick with anger when I am around them and they treat me poorly. (They talk about my lack of exercise, my lack of a social life^(that they took away), my lack of leaving the house, and more things that I find hurtful) I will spend Christmas with them, but I don’t feel like I have to “hang out” with them a lot, definitely not with the way they act towards me. sorry for bad format....

1283,"Me (23F) & my bofriend (24M) - he says he's stressed and ignores me for days. Is there a bigger problem? Hey, I’m new here and I came to ask for some relationship advice. I’ll try to keep it short but it’s complicated. I first started dating my boyfriend in May last year and we broke up around 4 months later. He initiated both the relationship and then the break up (saying he doesn’t feel enough love). We were both later seeing other people but started talking again in January this year. There have always been a lot of ups and downs whether we were in a relationship or just friends. Anyway, I moved away at some point this year, we stopped talking for a while again but then got back together 2 months ago and we basically started dating long distance (we met a few times though). Again, he initiated it but I was still very much in love with him, so yeah I was down for it. Everything was good until a week ago when I was visiting him. The problem is that he has horrible mood swings. He has an extremely stressfull job and it is number one priority for him so he wants everything to be perfect. He needs to study a lot during a few periods throught the year (now it’s the time and the last big mood swing happened when he actually found out how much work he’s gonna have this time) and I understand all of that. However, I feel like he’s just using his work as an excuse to hide bigger problems. Right now he completely stopped talking to me when I left his apartment (after he asked me to), after 3 days of no contact I just sent him a text saying that I know he has a lot of work but I fully support him and I’m here if he needs help or just wanna take a break from studying for a while. He replied the next day only to say thank you. So I get it, he’s stressed, he has a lot to do, he doesn’t wanna talk to me – but is this really how some men deal with stress? Also, we were going through the same things before we broke up last year but back then I was trying to push him to talk to me and explain himself. This time I’m just gonna give him space but I’m confused and it’s stressing me out as well. It will sound crazy but I’ve known him for almost 2 years now and everytime there’s something going on I’m thinking whether he might have some other issues because I just don’t understand how anyone would do this kind of things to people they care about. At first I thought he’s just a narcissistic a\*\*hole, now I actually started thinking whether depression or bipolarity could be an option. I know I might just be looking for a problem where there’s actually none but I just want answers. I still love him and I wish we would last but I can’t seem to understand what’s going on in his mind. Maybe he just simply doesn’t know how to break up with me or something but then again, he asked me if I’d like to move in with him when I’m done with my job abroad a week prior to this, we were plannig a trip for the next spring literally one day before this all started again. I was a bit scared to get attached quickly this time and he seemed so excited about us being together but now I don't know. It is so confusing. &#x200B; **TLDR**: my boyfriend has a history of horrible mood swings & apparently handles stress by ignoring me. wtf is actually going on?",
1284,"Muslims and Dysfunctional FamiliesDoes anyone else feel like Islam inherently encourages dysfunctional families? I’m Central Asian but even among the South Asian or Middle Eastern families I know, they’re mostly dysfunctional. Growing up I feel like being in the family that I’ve been in has been highly damaging and changed my views on a lot of things. I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place. I’m 16, and I can’t stand living in this difficult and abusive environment anymore. I hate my father so much, I’ve wanted to kill him at so many different points in my life and still do. He’s physically abusive at times but also verbally. I also hate my mom but I love her a lot too. She’s emotionally abusive and I can tell it comes from both her bad mental health and a place of looking out cause she hasn’t had an easy life either. Being gay and an ex-Muslim certainly doesn’t help cause I’m not even sure if I can come out to my mom. Without a doubt I don’t care about my father and the only reason I haven’t killed him yet is because it’s illegal. I just don’t want to break my mom’s heart one day when I tell her I’m not a Muslim and if/when I tell her I’m gay. She’s so blindly committed to Islam, it hurts me so much. She loves Allah more than anything and it scares me how brainwashed she is. My mom works so hard for me to be able to live the life I live. She’s abusive but she cares. My dad is abusive and he doesn’t care. I feel like I’m always considering the feelings of others before myself as a result of my upbringing. I genuinely don’t know how to be emotionally functional and I’m so fucked up mentally. I binge drink at 16 to ignore my problems because I can’t even seek help for my mental health in the name of Islam.",
1285,"WDISN To my teacher who ignored my partner problem?Hey guys. So recently I've had a problem in my Technology class, that problem specifically being my partner, whos been a complete douche to me. So heres the backstory: My tech class has a partner system, in which we switch partners any time we start a new curriculum. Its pretty cool if you meet someone you like, and upon the first one I did. The second time around, however, I got stuck with a kid who I'll call dickweed for the rest of this story. So Dickweed is this kid who got held back a couple years, so hes bigger and older than the rest of us, however his age didn't particularly dictate how smart he was, because he's the dumbest kid in that class. Dickweed's parents, however, are pretty rich, and they spoil him like crazy. He constantly acts like he's entitled to giving him things, or doing shit for him. The main thing that pisses me off is that he makes you do all the work while he makes fun of you and calls you lazy. Usually he'll hit me or something if i do something he doesn't like, and he calls me names all the time. So, the clear option was to go ask my teacher if I could get a new partner, because this guy keeps on messing with me. But instead of getting a new partner, or just at least giving him a talk, he told me to ""step up"" and ""work harder."" What do I say now? I'm planning to speak with him tomorrow, since we only have a week left before winter break.",

1290,"Forgotten/ignored by almost all my friends on my birthday. Have I been neglecting friendships? Am I the problem?Hey, I've seen a few posts on reddit where this happens to people, but I just can't seem to stop thinking about this. Usually at least I get a birthday gift from one friend or a phone call or something. My birthday just ended and the only people who called me were each of my parents. Mostly just my immediate family and very few friends said anything. I totally get that people care about themselves first, and lead very busy lives. But basically all the 'friends' who I thought I had a good relationship with, completely ignored me. To me it just showed that they don't think about me or consider me important, as I consider them. All of this is just weighing on my brain because it's quite painful to think that my existence lacks impact or relevance to so many people's lives who I thought were my friends, that none of them would say anything to me. But what hurt me the most today is the person who once considered me their best friend (in college), didn't acknowledge me all day. I even texted her to see if she was alive, and she didn't respond. She's managed to make several posts on social media otherwise. Throughout the years, we have always made some time for each other's birthdays. I've even planned a birthday trip for her. She's planned celebrations for mine too, and some years were less festive than others because my birthday falls during finals season.But we've always at least gotten each other a gift or something.. and at least called. In the past year I have been isolating myself to an extent. I used to be very involved on my campus (in mostly stem-related organizations, because I started out as an engineering major). I spent 2 years pretending to still be in engineering because I was too prideful to admit I switched out. So eventually I just left the organization I had formed most of my connections in. That's how I met the ""best friend"" in question, and only our relationship survived after I left. Nobody else bothered to reach out to me since. I essentially cut off everyone else in our mutual circle, because I never felt very accepted by them in the first place, and I've been ashamed about my academic life, I guess. I'm sure I sound stupid & that's fine. That has put a strain on how we interact- I've avoided social gatherings she wanted me at because I knew my ""former acquaintances"" would be there, most notably, her birthday party this year. But I still got her a gift and apologized for not making it in advance. She's gotten closer to her other friend groups since, and I've been brushed to the side. I see that clearly now and I suppose I have myself to blame. I've always felt like I'm not very interesting to her & her other friends. Whenever I meet her other friends, they treat me negatively because I don't seem to fit into their standard of a person worth engaging with. I find myself way more interesting than they are, ironically. On the other hand, I actively spent this year trying to strengthen and maintain my other friendships. I recognized that when I went to college (grew up outside of USA, attending a US college) I lost a lot of friends from adolescence. I've prioritized staying in touch with the ones I still have and I thought that was going well. But almost all of them didn't say anything. TL;DR I suppose I just want to ask if it sounds to you like I've removed myself from people's lives. Should I be looking at myself and what I've done wrong/ not done, when the people I cared about showed that they do not care as much? Is that likely because I haven't given them a reason to care? Or should I just be looking for better friends in general? I genuinely just want to understand if it is likely that I am the problem. I know this post was very long. I'll appreciate it it even one person gives their opinion on my situation.",
1291,"My sister(27f) ignores me(25f) when I try to talk to her about my mental health problemsSo for about 7 years I have had on and off anxiety and depression. I saw a psychiatrist for a bit when it started. My sister knew about this and also knows I continue to have anxiety. when I was 22 I told my sister that I have suicidal thought. I haven’t had suicidal thoughts in a while but still have a lot of anxiety. I had an anxiety attack three days ago and it was one of the first real anxiety attacks I have had. I have a boyfriend(25m) who I can talk to but I am really close with my sister and wanted to talk with her about it. I tried talking with her last night when we were alone together for the first time since it happened. We were at my dads house (where she is living for a short time between apartments) we had a family dinner and at one point in the night we were in her room for the first time and I decided to talk to her about what happened. She basically disregarded what I was saying, was on her phone the entire time I was talking and then before I was done telling her what happened she said we should go back out to the living room to see everyone. She didn’t ask me if I was ok and never mentioned what I said to her for the rest of the night. It really upset me so I decided to text her today about it. I thought about calling and talking to her but I wanted to be sure I articulated myself correctly so I decided to write a message and text it to her. Here is the message: Hey I’m a little bit sad. Last night when we were in your room downstairs I tried to talk to you about the anxiety attack I had and you were basically on your phone the entire time I was telling you about it. And before I even finished telling you about what happened you said we should go upstairs, ending the conversation. I feel like I can’t really talk to you about issues I’m having because you don’t take them seriously. It’s also hard after last week when you came over after your meeting with the counselor and you kept saying you feel like you always take care of people and I feel like you don’t ever check in on me. You never ask how my mental health is or how julien and I are doing. It just makes me really sad because it’s hard for me to talk about mental health issues I have and last night you totally disregarded my anxiety attack and didn’t even ask how I’m currently feeling. I sent her the message 7 hours ago now and didn’t receive a response. I don’t really know what to do. I want to message her and see if she got my message (which I’m sure she has as she is on her phone many times through the day) but I’m also really upset she hasn’t written me back or called me. I tried to express how I need her support and getting no response is pretty upsetting. Any advise is helpful, other than completely cutting her out of my life. Thanks Tl;dr my sister has known about my mental health issues for years. I tried talking to her about my recent and first anxiety attack and she disregarded me. I texted her telling her how I feel and got no response. What should I do. Edit: for everyone saying am always putting my problems on my sister I am not. I only talk to her about serious issues 1-2 times per year. I am always there to support her, I check in on her, ask her how her boyfriend and her are doing a lot. The reason I wrote this I because I am always there for my sister but she is not there for me. She has been very selfish in the past and puts herself first in times when I need her (which is not very often). I am always there for her through every breakup and issue. I’m not pushing my baggage on her or asking her to be my therapist. I literally just wanted to talk to my best friend and sister about what’s going on in my life. I do have a psychiatrist I called the day after my anxiety attack and they have no availability for 3 weeks. I thought maybe my family could be there for me during this time. I support my family a lot, and just want to be supported back. Also just to note this is the first issue I have come to her to talk about since Christmas 2018. So there have been no recent issues Update: she responded with this : Hey I’m sorry I made you feel sad. I had a few drinks and wasn’t thinking. I hope your feeling better. Please don’t be mad at me I’m happy to talk and do want to know about what your going through. Give me a call love you I’m so happy. Thank you for all of your advise everyone. I’m definitely going to have a good conversation with her to make sure she’s ok too.",

But every now and then a sad mood washes over me. I look at my scars, and I feel my abdomen, knowing it’s all fucked up. I distract myself with my friends, anime, movies, games. When this sad mood drapes over me I restart an addiction to porn, and I’ll be in bed all day wasting my hours watching god knows how many videos. I thought since I was a lesbian It wouldn’t effect me as much, but it’s hard to think, that I won’t get to a mother to my own child, even though I’m young I’ve been through a lot, but it all hurts.

1298,"Made a post here few days ago while drunk, deleted itI made a new account because I know my ex browses this sub as well and I was scared he’d find me. I have been struggling with alcohol for years, but it was mostly just me drinking socially and hating it (example: is drinking this much normal? Ugh, I *have* to go out I *have* to drink, etc.) In 2018 I broke my leg twice and I would drink an entire bottle of wine just laying there. It fucked me up. You can not heal well with a system of alcohol. I broke it twice. My tolerance has stayed high. I work in a bar. I would drink ALL the time. I woke up hungover. I gained weight. Since I broke my leg well over a year ago, I have been a drinker. I mentioned to my now ex I wanted to go to AA. His response: you don’t need to. My binge drinking was out of fucking control. He’s a social drinker, I know he wanted to ignore my problem because he wanted to still have drunk fun with me. But? Everyone. I feel like I have brain damage from the past 12 years of drinking. I used to read a lot, make art— i used to ?? Think more ?? And then I broke my leg and when my suicide attempt (pills) didnt work, I think my brain went into a subconscious attempt to finish the job with alcohol. Its done. I’m done. I’m out of the unsupportive relationship. Ive tried quitting a number of times but this one is serious. I wont punish myself for all the times i tried but failed— every day is a new day. I havent drank for 2 days. Tomorrow will be my third day. This community seems to not give up on people. Ive been lurking for months. Im excited to get my brain back. I’m excited to have my mornings back. Thank you for reading. IWNDWYT",

He doesn't like to share his problems or when he is sad. He didn't told me this for a few days and whenever we met he looked fine and happy. It's been a month and now he has told me. He didn't go to meet his sister as she like in different state and he's got classes here. But now he got off for a week and still he's not going to meet her. I know he's sad because before the birth of the baby he was so excited and couldn't wait to meet his sister and her newborn. Apart from this his family is going through financial problems and there's nothing much he can do about it. I don't know what to do in this situation. I told him to go and spend few days with his sister but he keeps ignoring the topics. Don't talk much and everytime I call him he just hang up on me, every fucking time. We use to talk fine before I knew it but now he just doesn't even want me around. He doesn't want to meet me ignores my calls. I don't know, I love him and even the thought of not being with him kills me. Whatever little we talked he just passes some hate comments on me. Sometimes his hate just gets on my nerves. I know none of it is my fault and he's going through a phase but I just really want to help him out of this.",

Her: can I get them with the bone? Me: Unfortunately not. The deal is for boneless wings only. Her: For the $5 deal? Me: Yes. Her: how many wings are the boneless ones? Me: it’s an order of 8 wings in total. Her: for $5? Me: Yes. An order of eight boneless wings for $5. Do you have any *other* questions about the deal? Her: No, no. I know what I want. Me: Okay, what can I get for you? Her: I want the eight bone-in wings for $5. Me: Our orders of eight wings are only boneless, and so are the ones in the $5 deal. Her: So I can’t get them with the bone? Me: No. No you cannot. Her: Okay. I’ll take the eight boneless wings for $5. Me: Okay. Anything else? Her: No. Those are boneless right? Me: Yes, ma’am. Her: and they’re $5? Me: Again, yes. Is that all for you today? Her: Yes, thank you. *when she came to pick them up* As soon as she walks in the door, she ignored me asking what her name on the order was and said “I ORDER EIGHT BONE IN CHICKEN WINGS FOR $5” and I said “you mean boneless?” And she said “oh, yeah”. I wanted to kill myself. Side note: she was about 30-35 years old, so she wasn’t old and hard of hearing or dealing with dementia or anything. We had normal conversation after that.

1302,"I want to kill myself, but not for any good reason really. It’s just there.I’m rounding off my third term here at Waterloo, and it’s been fine enough I guess, considering everything’s a mess. I’ve struggled a lot, but I’ve gotten though it, and I’ll *hopefully* be able to continue in my program next term, so crossing my fingers. Throughout it all I’ve felt so terrible though. Like, I don’t really have a good or fair reason to feel terrible, but I do, and it won’t go away. I feel so sad constantly about my parent’s divorce ten years ago, and how I’ve lost any chances of a good relationship with either of them. And the only other adult that really ever supported me was one of my mom’s old boyfriends—I’ve got no contact with him now, and tbh he’s really a terrible human being that I think beats his kids, although he was nice enough to me. But c'est la vie. But that’s all in the past. I should be past that now, and I thought I would be when I came here from high school, and I thought these feelings would go away. But they’ve just gotten worse. As I said I did really struggle with school; each term has been worse than the last, and I don’t know if I’ll be able to continue in my program since I really ruined my position in a course this term that I needed to have passed with a 70 this term. Tbh I spent almost the entirety of the time I set aside for that course this term (its an online course) thinking about all this, killing myself and such. But c'est la vie. Socially I’ve had a pretty good time. I’m somewhat well connected, I think most people like me, and a lot of people recognise me. But it feels so fake, and it doesn’t change how I feel on the inside. I really don’t think I have any good reasons. All of my problems are either in the past, or a self-inflicted result of being hung up on said problems from the past. And I mean, even if I fail out like I probably will, I could still probably continue in just half of my program—non-coop CS—so I’d probably have a fine life. Even now I’ve got a great life, compared to most people on Earth, in a great country, with food, water, and jobs. I’m just some entitled cunt that ought to shut up and enjoy what life he has. But I still don’t want to. I just wanna be rid of all these demons haunting me. And I don’t feel any inclination to continuing on for continuing on’s sake. It just seems so valueless, at this point I don’t care about trying to be happy anymore, I just wanna be *not this*. I’ve got no good reasons for any of this, it’s just a pathetic sob story, and I don’t think it’s really fair to people with actual problems for me to run and around and call myself depressed or suicidal or anything, but **I want to die** nonetheless. It does feel nice to write that bolded text out. I’ve written out dozens of posts just like this one over the past three terms, but I never decided to post them. At this point, I think I’m still here just because I’m not sure what trouble some suicide is worth. But c'est la vie—or not. We’ll see I guess.",

I was born in the UK and went to an all boys high school in South Africa. I'm not necessarily the most socially outgoing person so I've never really been able to make any moves on girls like that and the lack of experience is really fucking me up. I don't think living without this experience is worth it at all, so I've been seriously considering ending it for a year or so and I feel like I've reached my breaking point now.

1304,"I tried to kill myself.Not today, not yesterday, 9 years ago. No one knows. No one noticed. I took a bunch of pills out of various bottles my family had lying around. Adderal, percocet, sleeping pills, and allergy meds were among them. I don’t know what else. There were more than four bottles. It was just whatever I could find. I swallowed some of each, chasing them with a wine cooler. Let a few dissolve on my tongue because I liked the sickening feeling they induced. I thought that would be enough. After a few minutes of nothing happening, I swallowed more. Got dizzy. Struggled to make it to the couch. Passed out. I was passed out in the living room and my family didn’t notice. They walked by me and didn’t notice. I still remember it all vividly and think of it often. I had no regrets. I wanted to die. Waking up, realizing I was still alive, that was the worst feeling I’ve ever felt. It put me in a daze. I’ve felt on pause ever since. I often regret not dying. I feel like I should be dead. I feel like a large part of me did die that day. The only reason I didn’t immediately try again was fear of not fully dying. I knew I couldn’t go through that again and didn’t have other resources I felt were adequate. I dropped out of school shortly after. I stopped leaving my house. I see all these stories of people living and being ecstatic over it. I don’t have that. Life hasn’t gotten better. I just wanted to tell someone.",

1308,My husband (34M) told me(38F) to kill myself after I asked him if he was texting someone. Even went as far to tell me ways to kill myself and said he felt no emotions towards me cryingMe and my husband have been having problems for a while with him being on his phone which I do accept is my insecurities about things in the past but he has started seriously protecting his phone lately. To the point he has actually put his hands on me and acussed me of trying to touch his phone when I wasnt. Today we had a great day and he was sweet and listened to me about how he makes me feel (I thought) then I caught him typing something on his phone when I walked in the room and he quickly jerked and put his phone away. When I asked him if he was texting someone he joked and dismissed the question being silly and making me laugh . I asked again after we stopped being silly and he started doing karate kicks and being silly again. A couple minutes later I realized he never did answer me so I asked him again to please answer me I might be feeling some kind of way and he said he could not remember (it was 10 mins before at most) so I asked him can you please check your phone and see. He snapped and spent the whole rest of the night telling me (I should kill myself and please go suck on a vehicles tail pipe over and over with a bunch of nasty personal things I've shared with him about my childhood added in) Told me I ruined his life and he was not meant to spend his life being tricked into marrying me. He said my children hate me and so much more extremely hurtful shit!! He did finally admit that he was texting a girl from his work but it was a question for her fiance that also works with my husband! When I asked why didn't you just text him he said the fiance wasn't in the conversation. When I asked can you please show me the text I'm really confused. It went from horrible to I don't even feel like living anymore! I feel so stupid!! I just can't believe my husband would seriously tell me over and over for hours to kill myself and say such hurtful things to me over a question!! He says I'm being crazy and jealous and it's all messing with my head!!!,

I planned to kill myself on January 7, 2020. I was serious enough about it that I made a whole plan, knowing everything about how it was going to work. That plan got me through some low moments because I told myself I only had X amount of days left. About a week ago, though, I realized that I only had a week left on Earth. So I went out with friends. I bought some new clothes, something I've been in desperate need of, and wore them proudly. I cooked for myself and made meals that were healthier than what I'd been eating. I pushed myself back into a basic workout routine. I built a world for a D&D campaign I intend to DM and let myself be proud of it. I went a week clean of self-harm. I helped a friend of a friend get started on the process of hormone therapy (I'm three months on T on the 20). I was so involved with a of this that I didn't even process that today was the seventh until a couple hours ago, and now it's the eighth, and I survived. I see my therapist on Thursday, so two days from now. This is by no means an end-all, be-all, but I feel good. I genuinely feel good. I'm making progress :)",

1330,"My life has been consumed by porn, video games, internet and food. I’m looking for a better life so I don’t have to kill myself. It’s time to change.I realize that my life is controlled by porn, internet, video games and junk food. It took me years to find out this was the reason for a major part of my depression. I used to be so ignorant to it and in denial. Internet, porn, and video games have already taken a toll on me and I have been living this lifestyle since I was 12. I’m almost 19 and I’m at a point where it’s life or death. I recently graduated from high school and it felt great graduating but now I’m completely fucked. I’m very isolated so my only comfort is these things I stated in my first sentence. It’s come to the point where my brain feels depleted of those feel-good chemicals like dopamine and serotonin. Regular things don’t make me feel good anymore. I can’t find any joy in my life currently unless I’m excessively fapping, playing video games, eating the greasiest and sugariest foods out there to give me that kick of dopamine. It honestly feels like an addiction because I keep upping my tolerance of these things and if I don’t get enough of them then I go through withdrawal (more depression, more anxiety, etc.). The past few days I have been waking up to anxiety, nausea and intense depression, and I’m very certain it’s because I’m going through withdrawals from porn, video games and internet. I realized I’m at my lowest is when I’m isolated, which is typically when I’m on summer break meaning that I have 2 months to myself before going back to school. That’s when I would fap at least 5 times a day, sleep for 8-12hrs, wake up either in the afternoon or night and then browse the internet like YouTube or twitch for hours and then fap again while repeating this for 2 months until my summer break ends. I’m not sure why it took me so long to realize this was making me feel like shit but maybe because I’m realizing these things are an addiction and I didn’t realize it back then. My brain requires so much intense porn and so much junk food and internet entertainment to feel normal pretty much. I’m a fucking wreck. When I was in high school, I actually felt pretty decent. Sure, I still had my depression lingering in the back of my head but at least it wasn’t that bad. No one told me that internet and porn would be this bad. This is what happens when you have access to the internet as a child. It fucks with your brain chemistry. Now I’m suicidal so often now that it’s affecting my motivation to do anything. So, now I ask for your help. Hoping for some advice, tips, and how I can properly get back into society again. It’s really difficult to just go cold turkey, I don’t know how I can pull this off. Is there any posts here (or on other subs or articles) that show the negative effects of excessive porn, video games, and internet and how they felt after overcoming it? That might help. At my current state, I can’t go to the gym. So it might take some more time to get the will power to do that. What’s something I can do that’s easy? I need to do baby steps. Thank you.",

1333,Does anyone else ever think to themselves “any day now I’m going to kill myself”I just feel like I’m constantly on some sort of pin and needle. Just no way in hell I can survive anymore. Each day is the same boredom and misery. Prison. Let me out. I just don’t see where it’s worth it. I’m not super talented so the creative ability necessary to better myself isn’t there. Self destructive plagues always end up fucking me up,
1334,"i wanted to kill myself yesterday but i napped instead and i’m kinda proud of myself.i was sitting there, crying my fucking eyes out. i’m sure you understand the pain. deep in the chest. where you feel like everything in the world is wrong. nothing is ok. i was looking up suicide methods. i’m aware that i’m a coward. i could never do anything like hang myself or use a gun, as effective as they seem. i wanted to find a way out that was quick and painless. i think that’s something everyone wants. i got tired of searching. i was waiting in an online queue of 40 people on the suicide hotline chat. i didn’t want to call because i was afraid they’d come take me to the hospital. that 40 people took over an hour to get through. an hour of crying, contemplating if it’s worth it, eyeballing a bottle of pills i had. then, i finally got to the chat. i felt a little relieved. maybe they could help me. and then it said that it wasn’t working. i couldn’t talk to anyone unless i called. so i went on my laptop to check, i thought maybe it was just something wrong with my phone and that my laptop would work better. but the queue went up to 60 people. i was tired. it’s not like i actually DID anything but sit there and cry. but my body almost felt like i had ran a marathon. i felt exhausted. so i took a nap. i’m still not ok right now. but i’m not dead. and i’m a little proud that i could’ve used a coping mechanism my therapist gave me. i was proud i actually did something instead of just suffering.",
1338,"My mother told me to find somewhere else to kill myself.Last night, during an hour-long completely one-sided tirade, my mother screamed that when I kill myself, not to do it in the house, because she didn't want to deal with the mess. I was already building the resolve to commit suicide throughout her rant. I got hit with the typical ""you're not depressed, you're lazy"", and all the related tropes about how my situation is all my fault and anything she's doing is just in response to me ""hurting"" her by existing. I've posted about my situation here before, and to be honest I'm extremely surprised I made it this long. But when my own mother's response to knowing I am suicidal is to tell me not to get the carpets dirty, I'm feeling like it's time to cash out. Edit: Thanks, everyone, for all the support. If you sent a DM, I've read and am thankful for your support there as well; I'm just having weird anxiety about one-on-one conversation, which seems backwards because I'm fine with public venting, but that's anxiety for you.

There’s nothing keeping me in this world, and I would quite like to leave, so I’m going to wait until I’m made homeless, just to be sure. It’s honestly freeing having this planned, now I can sort out my belongings, enjoy the cold air in the morning knowing it’s one of the last breaths, the neighbors cats sweet meows, just seeing the steam rise from a hot coffee brings me joy knowing it’ll be over soon.

1342,"I feel so jealous of cis guys' dicks it makes me want to kill myselfWarning this is gonna be mad depressing so don't read it if it'll upset you, I'm so negative right now I can't believe this is it, we get one fucking life, ONE fucking life and mine is one where I'm condemned to not have a dick. Fucking rapists get to enjoy their dicks, murderers get to enjoy their dicks, fucking Hitler got to enjoy his dick, but me, someone who's never tried to hurt anyone doesn't get one. How the fuck is it fair? I get one shot at fucking EXISTENCE and I don't get to experience having a biological penis. It's not fucking fair. And to top it off, I'm actively hated for it! If a cis guy has some terrible accident or a birth defect where he loses or is born without a penis, everyone RIGHTFULLY feels terrible for him. Cause it is a fucking terrible thing! It's horrific! But trans guys who don't have penises are fucking mocked for it, HATED for being trans, these motherfuckers who've done absolutely nothing to deserve being born in a cisgender body can't just be satisfied with the fact their lives in terms of body/gender congruence are fucking amazing, they need to fucking boast about it, and rub it in. It's like being someone born with all your limbs, finding someone with no legs and just fucking rubbing it in, acting like it's a moral failing that they have no legs, and like they're not a human for having no legs, cause humans typically have 2 legs and 2 arms. I fucking hate it! I can't stand this! I don't want to live without a penis and I especially don't want to live in a world where every fucking guy has a dick and is ungrateful for it. I would KILL for a cis penis. I'd genuinely give up having my house in return for a dick for a day. I just need to know how a cis dick feels and I never can. why the fuck should I carry on living? As I type this I can feel a metaphorical noose tightening around my neck. I'm 22 years old. Every FUCKING SECOND of my life I feel this emptiness between my legs. I can't stand it anymore. Im missing a body part and no one around me acts like it's a big deal!!! If their dicks were gone it'd be a fucking big deal, but mine doesn't matter!??? Why am I thought of as a fucking second class citizen? Why does no one care about MY pain??? I just want to die. I want to die cause there's a fucking 0.00000000000001% chance there'll be an afterlife, some sort of reincarnation or something where I can get to experience having a cis dick. That beats my chances on this shit hole planet in my fucked up life cause I have a 0% chance of ever experiencing that because the world hates me. How am I ever going to come to terms with this? How??? How do you all cope? You're stronger than me mentally ill tell you that much cause I just want to fucking die. I only don't because my family will be sad, but then again my feelings go beyond fucking SAD and they don't care much. I just want my body part I'm missing. It kills. I don't know why I've been made to suffer like this, it's more painful than anything. I just need my penis and I can't fucking get it I want to die Sorry if I depressed you Anything that might make me feel a bit better would be appreciated cause it's nearly 5am and I can't stop crying and wishing I could be anybody else as long as they were a cis guy Thank you",
1344,"TIFU by making my dad think I want to kill myself because of my bondage kinkFor reference, I'm a male 19 yo in college in the US. I'm home for winter break right now. About a week ago, the girl I've been hooking up with here let me know that she has a bondage kink. It just so happens that I share similar tastes, so I immediately ran to home depot. Buying 50ft of rope raised some suspicion from the workers there. I avoided asking for the section that it was in, but couldn't find the ropes for like 20 minutes so I asked some guys who worked there where they were. They joked ""don't be goin tying anyone up now. We didn't hear nothin"". Little did they know... Then, at the checkout line, the cashier seemed slightly weirded out about my purchase. She gave me her snapchat, which could either have been because she was into me or because she was concerned I was trying to hang myself and was trying to give support. I never snapped her because I was not interested in that conversation with a stranger. Buying rope from home depot is a definite no no. Anyway, I get home and immediately put the ropes in my room, hidden away. I take a sigh of relief and pass out on the couch. About an hour later, my dad gets home and sees a Home Depot receipt for a 50ft rope. He wakes me up almost in tears. He thought I was trying to hang myself. At that moment I started internally panicking... there was no explanation I could give other than the truth to convince this man that I was not attempting to kill myself. So that's what I told him. I said ""Dad, do you really want to know the reason why I bought that rope? You're not going to like it."" He says yes. ""It's for a girl."" He scoffs and walks away. This is the most awkward moment of my life. But hey, the ropes ended up working really well for their intended purpose. Tl;dr I bought 50 feet of rope to play around with a girl who is into bondage. My dad finds the receipt and is convinced I'm trying to end my life. I had to tell him the truth.",

1347,"I tried to kill myself, and entered the realm between Eternities.I always thought suicide was simple. I was taught from an early age that it was wrong, period. It was never the answer. There were always other options, always other ways out. Suicide wasn't an answer. See, my parents are deeply religious. I don't mean that they're cultish or crazed zealots or anything like that, but they hold very seriously to Biblical values. Because of that, they always saw the commandment of ""Thou shalt not kill"" as applying to suicide as well as murder. They taught me that ultimately, they're the same. Suicide is no better than murder because it is the murder of yourself, and an abandonment of hope. They taught me that now how hard things got, they could never get that bleak. I wish I could have been that naive. But I wasn't. It was seven years ago to this day when I was told that I had a terminal brain tumor. I was only nineteen at the time, still living with my parents as I worked my way through community college, and anyone could see that things were rough already. My dad had just been fired from his job. We were behind on payments for our house. I barely could scrape up enough money to pay for each semester already, and I knew that this news would break then. We couldn't fight this, not really. Trying to keep their daughter comfortable as she slowly died would just suck them dry. At that point, I was also broken emotionally. I had just lost my girlfriend of three years to a car accident, and my closest friend had moved across the country a few months earlier. My parents and I weren't getting along very well, and when I was told the news, I couldn't have felt more alone in the world. I *had* thought suicide was simple. Then, I thought it was the answer. It was a week and a half after I found out when I decided to kill myself. My death was inevitable anyways, and this would help them in the long run. The decision made me surprisingly calm, and I knew exactly when and how to do it. My parents both worked on the weekdays and they left the house empty, all I had to do was circle back after I left for classes when I knew they were gone and I'd be good to go. I knew my dad kept a handgun in his study drawer, and it was easy to find and load. I had shot it before, he had taught me how. I remember everything about that moment. It was late morning, and the sun filtered through the blinds of my father's study. I could hear the grandfather clock ticking quietly across the room, could feel the hard mahogany desk beside me, and could see my hand as I raised it up to my eye level. My wrist trembled a bit as I leveled the gun to my temple, and I took a deep breath. I counted the ticks of the clock, one, two, three. I pulled the trigger. I felt the bullet rip through me. I know that sounds insane, but time seemed to slow to the milliseconds. I could feel the bullet tearing through my skin, ripping a hole in my skull before ultimately shredding through my brain. It didn't hurt, not like it should have. It was more of a dull awareness that my senses shouldn't have had, and I felt the bullet exit my skull in the same way. Then time sped again, and my body collapsed in a heap. I couldn't move. I couldn't look anywhere. I just lay there, and I felt my heart stop. I could see blood trickle out into a sticky pool of red around me, conscious all the while. I couldn't understand it. My mind wouldn't understand it. I had shot myself point blank in the head, and I was somehow bleeding out on the floor and fully conscious. It was impossible. I had thought suicide was simple. Then, I thought it might be the answer. As it turned out, it was something much more dangerous and far more horrific. I don't know how long I lay there, but ultimately, I was able to pull myself to my feet. I looked around myself in shock at the mess I had made in the study. Blood covered the floor, the desk, my clothes, everything. The wall behind me had stains of red mixed with chunks of brain plastered across it, and I stumbled back in horror. I saw the evidence before me, the proof of my suicide, and yet there I stood. Conscious. Living. Feeling numb, I subconsciously reached my hand up to my temple, and my fingers *felt* the hole in my skull. They came away warm and sticky, covered in fresh blood still oozing from the wound, and I couldn't comprehend it. I couldn't make sense of it. The world was spinning around and around and my brain couldn't function, couldn't comprehend what was happening to me. I could tell the symptoms of a panic attack were coming on, and I would have normally focused on settling my breathing. Then I realized, I *wasn't* breathing. I couldn't feel my heart, which should have been hammering away in my ribcage. My breaths, which should have been panicked and shallow, weren't there. For all purposes, I should have been dead. I *was* dead. Was I a ghost? Was this a dream? I didn't know. After the initial shock died away, I was able to focus on my surroundings. Other than the mess of my own gore, everything seemed the same at a glance. But on closer inspection, I realized that there were subtle things that were wrong. The colors of the room were dulled, like when someone turns down the contrast in a photo. The grandfather clock wasn't ticking, and the clock hands remained unmoving. The blood on the wall hadn't moved since I had gotten up, hadn't dripped down the wall any further. Stationary droplets hung to the paint, defying gravity. Nothing in the study made sense, and as I was still examining the room, the light from the window slowly dimmed and faded to darkness. In a few short seconds I was left standing in complete blackness with time itself standing still. Then, from somewhere downstairs, I heard a screeching howl. It was shrill and painfully loud, ripping through the silence of the study like a jackhammer in the middle of a Sunday mass. I might not have been thinking rationally at the time, but I had enough sense to pick up the gun from the floor beside me as I backed up rapidly. It was ironic when I think about it now. A few short minutes earlier, I had tried to end my own life. Now, I was suddenly afraid of losing it, or whatever state of consciousness I had. Seconds later, a deep red glow appeared in the hallway outside of the study. The screeching continued, getting louder as the glow grew brighter, and I instinctively took a few steps back in alarm. It was too dark to see and my foot slipped on the puddle of my own blood still on the floor, and my legs went out from under me. I crashed to the floor and the handgun went skidding out of my hands. Then I caught a glimpse of what was making the screeching, what was causing the glow. A figure stepped into the study from the hall, a tall, gangly figure that had to stoop to fit under the doorframe. It was naked and covered in black scales, and the long limbs twisted as it stepped forward. Its eyes shone like red spotlights, piercing the darkness of the room as I scrambled backwards in panic. I wasn't even aware that I was screaming until it spoke. Well, ""spoke"" isn't exactly the right word to use. It paused at the doorway, those burning red eyes fixed on me. Behind them I caught a glimpse of a horned head and sharp, gleaming teeth, but that mouth didn't move. Yet somehow, I heard deep, guttural words echo in my mind. ""Why are you screaming, little one?"" I instinctively shut my mouth, and the creature tilted its head at me. ""Are you afraid of me? Are you afraid of this place?"" ""What.. what are you?"" I stammered as I crawled back. Something that was reminiscent of laughter echoed in my head, although there was no humor in it. It was a twisted, warped sound. ""Little one, I am the Demon of the Beyond. The ruler of this realm, of the in-between that exists between Life and Death. You've entered into my domain."" ""H..how?"" I gasped, as my back came up against the hard wall. There was nowhere else to go, no more places to back up to. The demon took another step forward and this time I felt the ground shake beneath his mighty steps. His eyes never once turned away from me, illuminating my body and the section of the room around me in an eerie light. ""It is simple. You ended your life on your own, and that gave it to me."" I stared, mouth agape. What did that mean? That suicide led to… this? That was foolish, ridiculous, impossible. I believed that after death there were only two options, Heaven, or Hell. Suicide, accident, sickness, it didn't matter how you died. How you lived, however, mattered where you ended up. But yet, here I was. Dead, yet alive. Talking to a demon in my father's study as time stood still. As if reading my thoughts, the demon continued. ""I do not control eternity itself, but I am given this little slice of it. When you decided to play God and end your own life, you came to me. Not to Him, not to the Other. You became *mine*, little one. And now, I give you a choice."" ""What kind of choice?"" I asked, as I stood up to face the demon. It still towered over me, but I refused to let myself seem powerless. ""You can either take your chances and pass on through my domain, maybe ending up in one of the two Eternities, maybe falling into the void of nothingness. Or, I can send you back to your mortal world, without the fatal wound you inflicted on yourself and without the fatal curse that God has bestowed to you."" My mouth went dry. ""You're lying. How can… how can any of this be real?"" I swear, a different glint came into those horrible eyes as I spoke, and the demon was suddenly at my throat, lifting me into the air by a shockingly powerful arm, and I found myself staring into that gaping maw of teeth. ""Do you doubt my power, little one?"" the voice snarled in my mind. ""I can drain your soul like it is nothing if I so desire."" ""Then what… do you want from me?"" I managed to gasp out. The mouth closed, then morphed into something like a smile. ""A successor."" I dropped to the floor and hit the ground hard, and the demon moved back a step as it spoke. ""I tire of being trapped in this realm, a curse given to me by the Devil. I hold power, but not enough to release myself, unless I gift that power to another mortal. If you swear your soul to me, I will restore you to your life, fully healed. And then when you die, decades later, you will take my place as the gatekeeper of souls in this wretched land."" I swallowed hard. ""And if I… refuse?"" ""You will wander for several lifetimes here, without my guidance, until you either stumble into Heaven or Hell by chance, or the void claims your soul. The latter is far more likely. The choice is yours."" A choice. But there was really no choice left to make. I had tried to kill myself, I had tried to die, and I saw a glimpse of what would happen to my soul if I let go. Suicide wasn't the answer, it was simply the first step in an impossibly painful path. I didn't want that. But to become like this creature… I looked around me then, taking in the study illuminated by the red glow. I saw the pictures of my family on my dad's desk. I saw the Star Wars mug I had given him when I was ten, and the smile it had given him. I saw the trips he and my mom went on with me, when we didn't have much to spend, but had made the most of it. I saw the good times and the bad, and I made another decision right then and there. I decided that I didn't want to lose them, not for good. ""You swear to me that you can take away my tumor as well?"" I asked hesitantly. ""I swear on the Lake of Fire itself,"" the creature said. ""You will be restored to a full and healthy life, a life that will be untampered with until your demise. Then, you will take my place and I will be released."" ""Then I accept your deal,"" I said, and I silently prayed that I hadn't made a mistake. In the blink of an eye, the study was back to normal. One second it was darkness, with the demon standing before me and then the next, the morning light was shining through the blinds and the grandfather clock was ticking away angrily across from me. The demon had disappeared, and so had any signs of my attempted - or rather, successful - suicide. The blood and fragments of gore had disappeared from the walls and floor, and the gun wasn't where I had left it. I later found it back in the drawer where I had gotten it. In fact, everything was normal in an instant and I found myself wondering if what I had just seen was some kind of crazed nightmare. Groaning quietly, I put a hand on the desk beside me to pull myself to my feet, and that was when I saw it. There was a symbol etched into my right wrist, a half open pentagram that was seemingly carved into the skin. It glowed a faint red, like the demon's eyes, but faded away into nothingness after a few moments of looking at it. I know now that what had happened was very much real. The doctors verified - to their amazement - that my tumor had apparently disappeared. I had survived my suicide and was given a second chance at life, a chance that ended up being able to help my family get through their financial struggles and meet the person that would become my wife, a wonderful woman named Amber. But on nights like these, when I'm lying in the dark, alone, I can almost see *him* standing again in the doorways. My wrist starts to burn, and when I glance down at it, I can once again make out the symbol that's been burned into me. The symbol of the Demon of the Beyond. The symbol of my fate. And on nights like these, I appreciate the second chance I've been given. But I can't help but wonder at the cost of it that I have yet to face.",

1354,"At the tender age of 8, I planned to kill myself when my dad found out. He didn't react well.When people know that you're going to have an attempt, most would lend a shoulder and try their best to comfort you. But not my relatives, especially my father. When I reached first grade, my parents enrolled me to an elite school in the city. when I was more isolated. I had no real friends. No one to talk to. My parents were always at work and I was always home alone with a neighbor who watched me over. It was all too much until I snapped. I don't want this post to be too graphic, so let's just say I made myself bleed and when the help saw me, she told my dad. A part of me expected that he'd sympathize but NOOO. He yanked my arm and spanked me with the metal part of his thick leather belt until it broke. He replaced it with a whip until he was tired. For an obese man, whipping your kid for mental unwellness for three hours was a lot so he stopped after that. He didn't speak to me for weeks after that. Now everytime he mentions it he's somewhat proud I lasted it and became a stronger person and would laugh it off, but it's never been the same for me. The cuts and bruises he and I made on my body healed, but I'll always remember they were there. I regressed into a shy little child and abandoned my talents for years, and I'm only starting to regain them again after 7 years or so. Please please. Idk your kids but don't beat them up when they're lost. Talk to them about it. Send them to therapy. Support them.",
1356,"I was going to kill myself this weekend then a friend of a friend did it first.I had everything planned. on friday I bought these sleeping and pain pills from kroger. online it said 20-30 would do the trick. I had began the outline of my notes. one for family, one for my friends. sunday night, because then I wouldnt have to worry about messing up the work schedule and making someone come in. it was a new week, and I thought it’d be nice to start the week off with my death. so fucking weird in my head. then saturday morning my best friend called me crying saying her other best friend had killed herself the night before. i use best friend because she was insanely close to the both of us. we were family to the mutual friend, but neither her or i had known each other that much. and I spent the day with all of the girls friends despite barely knowing her. I only knew my best friend. but i didnt exactly feel out of place. later that night I held my friend for hours after she had drank a lot and smoked and she sobbed into my arms about how emotionally terrible she felt about everything from even before she learned of her death. I felt so selfish. the entire day before I was thinking that I was going to kill myself and hope the girl would be able to comfort our mutual friend. I was thankful in such a twisted way that I wasnt the one who died. I kept crying because seeing my friend cry hurt, but at the same time it felt like a relief. I didnt want to put my friends through that. i didnt want to die yet. I just feel guilty it took another person taking their life for me to get to this.

1363,When I was a kid I planned to kill myself in front of my parents.Hello. I was born into a family with a brother who was violently sexually abusive. It started when I was 4 and continued up until I was 13. At the same time I was abused by other pedophile who was not violent but still obviously abusive from the ages of 10 to 13. I told my parents about the second abuser and they put him in jail and rallied around me with total support. I told my parents about my brother who was 20 at this time now and they bullied me into lying to the police so that my brother wouldn’t get into trouble. It worked my brother got away with his crimes. I had been suicidally depressed since I was 7 and resented my parents for what they have done to me and for having put me in this situation to smile and be polite and nice to my brother during family events and holidays so they and he could pretend everything was okay. I hated them for what they had done to me and I hated life and wanted to die. So at 13 I made a plan to kill myself but to punish my parents by making them watch me die. That’s it. That’s all I had to say I guess. I didn’t do it obviously I grew up and got away from my home. But I still think about it all the time and look back in horror in how awful my life was at the time that I even considered that.,

1367,"i wanna kill myself againthis is my throwaway account that i literally only use to talk about how much i wanna kill myself. and the occasional nostupidquestion question. but whatever. i havent self harmed in a month and a half which i guess is an accomplishment. but while driving i was just thinking of how great it would be if someone just crashed into me and i died. or even better how nice it would feel to take one of my razor blades and just slice lengthwise down my entire forearm. the actual act of cutting myself hurts a little bit. it makes my body tense up and if it’s after i showered and the room is humid i even sweat a little. but i tell myself to keep cutting deeper. i don’t even know why. it just feels like a measurement of how much i want to die and i feel like that’s something that should be kept track of. ykno when you’re in a shitty mood and think everything is just awful and can’t get better. and then other times you’re as happy as you could possibly be, all those awful feelings completely gone. i feel like i need something to remind myself of how i really feel. keeping this little 4 inch long by probably half or quarter inch wide cut on my leg makes me feel... i don’t know. safe? i bought skin bleaching cream to fade some acne scars and have been using it on my cut. i don’t know why. i think i’ll feel lost if this scar fades. i also think i’ll probably cut myself again pretty soon before it really gets a chance to fade. but i feel like i’ve gone through so much to get it where it is and now that it’s healed and closed after a month clean i’m trying to fade it. i think if i were to get a tattoo i could be happy with a tattoo of this fucking scar. i guess it’s kind of like a black hole. when i’ve felt shitty i just pushed those feelings into the cut. i always clean it off when i do it. rubbing alcohol, neosporin and the likes. if the cut is a physical manifestation of my thoughts that won’t leave me alone, then cleaning it up after is like therapy. i had sex with this guy before the cut had time to heal and when he saw it i think he knew what it was. maybe he didn’t but i just assume i’m transparent and everyone can see through my “oh i tripped” or “ah that was an accident haha” lies. actually it’s so big that my mom thought it was a burn mark from the kitchen for awhile. maybe she still thinks that but that’s beside the point. when i told him it was an accident he kinda went “... alright” and didn’t bring it up again. but he did kiss it. now maybe it felt nice because it was my upper leg and he was hot. but maybe it felt nice because i’ve been forcing all this hatred and confusion and sadness and grief into this tiny little scar and someone finally switched that up and showed love or care. food for thought i suppose. anyways even after this whole stupid somewhat(?) poetic rant i still haven’t even talked about tonight’s trigger but i don’t even want to. i just want to kill myself so nothing else in my awful life can go wrong. let me wake up happy. please fuck. i’ve never been religious but i wish i was sometimes so i could pray to whatever might be up there and just ask for happiness again. or peace. or comfort. and i fucking hate my antidepressant too. it literally just causes anxiety and has done nothing absolutely fucking nothing for my actual depression. do people really read r/vent ? i want someone to read this because i can’t tell my friends. i have no one to tell except some random internet strangers. i’m tired but please someone read this and tell me youve been depressed. and tell me you’re not anymore and life can get better. 2:17AM i really am tired",

1369,"I want to kill myself because I'm not able to get a girlfriend or make a girl interested in me.I'm a 21 years old guy, soon 22. I never had a girlfriend, and I'm still virgin. Not just I was never able to get a girlfriend, but I was also never able to find hookups or one night stands (don't misunderstand me, I'm not looking only for sex from women). I have been trying dating since I was around 15-16 years old, to no avail. It hurts me everyday to think about the fact that almost every guy and girl had a crush/love/relationship in high school, but I did not. In high school, all my male friends had at least one girl who was having a crush on them. But I was never interesting for girls. According to my girl friends, I'm good looking and I have a very great sense of humor. I also have a lot of interests and hobbies, so I'm not a boring person. I've been using Tinder for more than a year now, and even though I was able to get matches, they either never replied back to my message, or they unmatched with me even without talking. There was about 5 girls who I was able to talk with for a longer time from Tinder, but whenever I asked them out on a date, they would say ""you are a good friend but you are not my type"" or ""let's just stay friends"". I also had a couple of women who just played with me, and used me for my kindness, like they made me believe how deeply in love with me they are, and then when I tell them the same, they would laugh and backstab me. I asked advice from my friends, and they told me I should go out with them clubbing, and talk to girls there. I tried it, but there are 2 problems with this: 1.I have absolutely no idea on how to start a conversation with a girl who is a complete stranger to me IRL (even though on Tinder, I have pretty good starting lines). And 2: it's always my friends who get the girls while clubbing, because the girls are interested in them, but not in me. I have no idea how they do it, I'm not a silent loner or anything like that. My condition is getting worse day by day, I'm thinking about suicide more often. I am already self harming, and I feel very bad for it because I made myself some very bad scars which I have to hide, and think of fake explanations for them when someone notices them. For the past month, I even started hating women, which I know is not right and is a very bad thing, but the rage and loneliness and disappointment makes me sick every day, every night I have difficulties falling asleep because of all the rage and feeling of desperation. Also, I now rarely go out (except when I go to work) because whenever I see a loving couple or a pretty girl walking on the street, I immediately feel anger and depression, because I know I might never experience these things such as love and relationship. I know, now many of you will say ""you are just 21, life is just ahead of you"" or ""things will get better just wait"" , but I highly doubt it. It feels worse than death, just to think about we all have one lives, and other people were able to find love and date in high school, and here I am at the age of 21, being virgin, and being late for such things as ""high school love"". &#x200B; Sorry for my rant, but I really need some advices/help. I don't know what I am doing wrong. Guys with worse looks (please do not think I am a narcissist) and worse talk are successfully finding girlfriends, and I am not. Thank you in advance for any advices!",

1381,"I tried to kill myself 2 days ago and now everything seems weirdHi Everyone, thanks for reading this. So as the title implies, I tried to kill myself on Sunday (1/26) night. So the backstory: I (F25) suffer from anxiety, depression, and PTSD. I was in therapy for 2 years. I take 37.5mg of Effexor daily, which I think works pretty well. However, I still struggle daily with mostly depression, some anxiety. I do have suicidal ideation pretty frequently, and have since I was 8 years old, some times are worse than others. Sunday night was my friend’s birthday and we were all at the house pre-gaming before we went out to the bar. I don’t drink very often, just a handful of times a year. Just as I was starting to get a little tipsy, I got an email from my therapist saying that her practice has been dissolved, effective immediately. That sucks on its own but that was the only therapist office accepting patients within a 2 hour drive of where I live. So that essentially means that I can no longer attend therapy, anytime in the foreseeable future, likely ever. So this upset me a little, I was tipsy so I started to tear up a little but just decided to ignore it and continue drinking. We all got to the bar and I had another 2 drinks and I was fine for first hour and a half or so but then I started to get really, really sad. Just like that kind of sinking heaviness in your chest, for no apparent reason. Then that sadness morphed into just a numbness, almost like I was outside my body and everything around me was playing like a slow motion film. So I got up and left the bar. The bar was about 2 blocks from the ocean so I just started walking towards the beach. It was really cold that night and I was just wearing a thin shirt and skirt but I don’t even remember feeling the cold. I walked all the way out onto the beach, to just where the tide was coming up. At this point, I realized I was sobbing and hyperventilating but hadn’t even noticed when that started. I should point out that I am terrified of water, I don’t know how to swim at all, and in 25 years of living at the beach, I have never been more than knee deep in the ocean, ever. I was just starting down at the water washing up around my feet and sobbing but I don’t remember feeling ANYTHING. I can’t recall ever feeling like that before, where it’s almost like there’s no thoughts running through my head. Then I just started walking, I walked out until the water was past my knees. I know it had to be freezing but I couldn’t feel it. I was almost waist-deep in it when I just stopped. There was no real “snapping out of it” or “ I don’t want to die”. My only thought at that point was “I really have to pee”. And I just turned around and walked out of the ocean, sobbing. I felt a twinge of failure, like “oh great, I’m such a coward when 5 more steps would have dropped me off the sandbar” but other than that, not much else. After that, I just got an Uber home. My fiancé had been drinking heavily and he had went home earlier. When I got home, I was obviously covered in sand, water and seaweed and he asked me what happened and I just said “I tried to kill myself and I don’t know why”. He just hugged me and I apologized but we haven’t talked about it since, even though I’ve tried to gently bring it up. So since then, I’ve just felt really strange. I definitely do not feel any renewed desire to *not* die but I’m also not actively suicidal. It just feels like this really big thing happened and I have no one to talk to and nobody around me cares. It’s also scary to me that I don’t know *why* I did it. Like that numbness and lack of thought was so scary. I should mention that I have done this one time before, when I was 18. I got very drunk at a frat party, got sad at the party and walked back to my dorm alone. I don’t remember feeling anything- not depressed or suicidal or desperate. But I was standing on a curb by a busy street and I thought “I should step out in front of a car”. And I did. It narrowly swerved and missed me and I just finished walking home where I cried myself to sleep. Again, I don’t know why I did this. Thank you for reading this far down, I know it was long and it feels good to tell *someone*. If anyone has experienced something similar or has any advice, I would love to hear it.",
1385,"Honestly, people need to stop saying ""I wanna kill myself"" or ""I wanna die"" if they really do notIt changes the whole meaning of the sentence. Like, I know you feel tired, or are sad that your boyfriend/girlfriend left you, or who knows what. But if EVERYBODY says those phrases it takes the light off those who need the most help. People who really wanna die. They say it, yet people think they say it jokingly. ""Me too"", they say. I just think that people need to pay more attention and when somebody says ""I want to die"", ""I don't wanna do this anymore"", ""I want to kill myself"", etc. to offer help and support.

As said, she was in a shitty mood, was vacuuming the house, got to my room, then ranted on and screamed in my ear about how I was a disgusting good for nothing pig who’s gonna fail life, because there was some rubbish under my bed and around the place. She then proceeds to say that I can’t have my sleepover, despite the fact I’ve already worked hard to earn it back once, and then today, the day after I got it back, she cancels it and makes plans with *her* friends. The verbal and emotional abuse happens day in day out. If I make a mistake, I get slapped. Talk back, yelled at and emotionally abused. I just can’t stand it any more.

1389,"Popcorn anyone? Or why I will not kill myself.By now, I'm 100% sure human civilization will end this century. Probably not all humans, but definitely civilization as we know it. The past years, while I still had some small hope that there's a way out of this future, I tried to make my friends aware of what I thought would happen, tried to make them vote for better politicians and things like learn about the science. Some agreed with me, but are simply not willing to do anything substantial about it, some even got multiple kids in those past years (even after watching that Utopia clip), some completely denied it and some even tried to silence me with constant attacks on social media, one almost killed himself after listening to the Ashes Ashes podcast and only one actually did something by joining XR. I still can't sit silent, but having many friends in India and Australia, and knowing how close they are to complete disaster, even at only 1.2 degrees, my hopes have completely disappeared, even in the much better protected country I life in. I probably knew this would happen long ago, from all the studies I did into psychology, society, climate science and system thinking. It's the great filter, and we've basically sprinted right into it, willingly. So what to do without hope? I often hear the question why to life if you have no more hope? At least for myself, I came to the conclusion, that I want to see this play out. Not for the wars and suffering, not to be there and tell everybody ""I told you so!"", but because I want to see exactly how it will play out. Call it scientific curiosity if you will. I'm an information junky, and even if I can't change the outcome substantially, I still want to see how correct my intuitions were. And even as one individuum of a failed species, I still think the gift of life is something to protect as long as possible. Like a cancer patient that was told he only has a few months more, I will try to life the next years to the fullest, even if that isn't the best thing for the environment. In some way, I even think the sooner the collapse happens, the better the chance of the survivors and their ancestors to survive long enough till the planet starts to recover. So I completely stopped advocating those small things that may have helped 50 years ago. Still, I wont buy a gas guzzler now, just because I lost all hope. But I will not try to change the world anymore, just to get attacked by some deniers. Popcorn anyone?",
1392,"Last Thursday I wanted to kill myself. It's Sunday and I'm still here.On Thursday 1/16/2020, I was on my way to my job at the bar, hungover and full of shame from embarrassing myself at a dinner party with friends the night before. I don't know how I got home, sent a bunch of mean texts messages to my ex, unsure what I did or how I acted in front of friends and acquaintances but, thats nothing new. I had been black out or nearly black out drunk everyday since before Christmas and most of the last 10 years. I silently sob in front of strangers on the bus and the metro. I decide to walk the rest of the way to work and to do so must cross a very high bridge over the highway. I stopped, peered over the fence and thought to myself “this is high enough to kill me.” I stood for about five minutes and stared over, rolling that thought around in my mind, how peaceful it could be if I ceased to exist. However, I’m an alcoholic, if I die right now i’ll never get to feel the numb the whiskey brings again. Im an alcoholic, I know that either directly or indirectly the booze will kill me eventually. Im an alcoholic, I wake up everyday pissed off that I did in the first place. So…I keep walking. That night, I got predictably black out drunk after my shift. I wake up to banging on my door. Loud, persistent banging but I'm still in a drunken haze and don't care enough to see what it’s about. A few moments later my roommate knocks on my door and timidly says “Hey Douchebabii - uh, the police are here…I don't think you're in trouble. They say they just want to talk to you.” I’m so confused. I shoot up out of bed and throw on clothes. My makeup from the night before smudged all over, looking and feeling like total shit. As soon as I step out of the door I see a friend of mine in the hallway with two policemen conducting a welfare check. “A friend of yours is concerned for your safety and called us.” “Are you okay?” “Do you need to go somewhere?” “Do you need someone to talk to?” Well, yes of fucking course I do but with tears in my eyes I tell them “No.” Over & over and over again to make this interrogation stop. &#x200B; They finally leave - I call said friend and she informs me that I posted my thought about the bridge on social media. For the entire fucking world to see. What a shitty fucking cry for help but cats out of the bag now. I log on and see just a totally shit faced picture of me with some drunk rambling underneath about jumping off a bridge. Holy fuck. After an intense day of honesty with a two really good friends I call my mom who thinks I’ve been sober for a pretty long stretch of time and I tell her EVERYTHING. She knows I've been drinking and starts crying and says something to me that will resound with me forever. We share a Lyft account (and I live in a city where I don't drive) and she said ""Every morning I wake up at 4 or 5 am and check the Lyft account to make sure you've gotten a ride home because then at least I know you're alive."" She gives me an ultimatum. I am leaving my city and coming to live with her and getting treatment or my entire family never wants to speak to me again. I am reluctant but I am so desperate to never feel like this again, I agree. So, we book a flight that night, I got to work for my last shift and tell my bosses and my roommate that I'm going to rehab and don't know when i’ll be back. Im 30 years old and back in my moms house pleading for help because I know I’m not the selfish, mean, & egotistical person alcohol has turned me into and I want a chance for the first time in my adult life to show the world that. I’ve gotten “sober” twice before - once for 11 days, once for nine days, in the 10 years I've been drinking. Each time turning me into a more & more god damn self righteous drinker. I sit here, shaking from Day Three withdrawals. I haven’t slept a fucking wink since that night and barely have the appetite for much. However, I can barely hold it together when I think about all the love and support Ive received from friends and family members that I long thought had written me off because of my drinking. Without them over this last 72 hours, I would be dead. I want to pay that forward to you all with all the love and support I can offer to this community. Hopefully, with medicaid approval I can start rehab this week. I found some meetings down here to attend. Most importantly I will not drink with you today. &#x200B; Thanks for reading.",

I knocked on it and asked him to let me in. I said I just wanted to cuddle. I don’t remember what happened next but I raped him. I don’t want to believe it but I believe him. He doesn’t want to press charges, just wants to be isolated from me. Do my roommate and I aren’t friends. And a lot of her friends were my friends so now I am pretty much alone. And I completely deserve it. I have to go back to a state where I know no one with the knowledge that I hurt someone so bad. I was so drunk. If I was in the right state of mind I would have never done it. I was suicidal before this. I can’t say if I’ll make it back to that school now.",
1401,"I was raped...and I liked itIt's taken a long while for me to admit this horrible truth about myself. I've been in denial for years and if you'd ever read some of the things I wrote in certain forums on the topic of rape you'd think I was the most militant, uncompromising feminist out there. But this was all a cover up for a reality I couldn't accept: a man forced his penis into me against my will and raped me and I orgasmed from it. My mouth said no but my well lubricated vagina said yes and I have had to deal with these two irreconcilable things for years now. I hated the thing between my legs for what it did it to me. I wanted nothing to do with it. I dind't even want to wash it in the shower. I hated that when, out of desperation, I did masturbate I could only come when I thought about him that night, pinning me down, pushing my panties aside and forcing himself into me. I cried and told him to stop as I was climaxing. I could feel myself contracting around his penis at the same time I was loudly protesting his violation. He felt it too. He told me I loved it. I hated him for making me come. I've been drinking some tonight and I finally have the courage to tell the truth. I try to be a strong feminist and hate my rapist for forcing me but I think of that night and I get wet. I've been careful to only date nice guys but they don't satisfy me. These men have been what every woman is supposed to want. But I don't want them. I want the asshole who kept fucking me even while i was crying, who clamped his hand over my mouth when I yelled for him to stop. I shouldn't be like this. I hate the hole between my legs. I wish I could just sew it shut and never have to deal with again :( EDIT: I just want to say thank you to everyone who responded to me and that I feel bad that I can't respond to everyone. I honestly didn't expect this much reaction and please don't be offended if I can't respond. Please know I read what you wrote. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I am very new to reddit.

1402,"FINAL UPDATE: My GF was raped and became pregnant. I broke up with her when she wouldn't abort the baby.Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bkft0r/my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i_broke_up/ TLDR: My GF was raped. Wanted to abort. Talked to mother. Decided not to abort. I left her. Update: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/blird0/update_my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i/ TLDR: GF calls me, reveals Mum made her not get an abortion because GOD CARES. She wants me back and arranges for abortion she wanted all along. Some of Reddit think I'm a baby killer. Update 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/boai5u/update2_my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i/ TLDR: Mother tries to get me arrested for kidnapping or domestic abuse or some loony stuff. I just wanted to update folk on this whole saga. This will be my final update. A few days ago, the abortion was carried out. During the weeks beforehand, my GF went to a counsellor and talked to a nurse about why she wanted an abortion. She was also tested for any STIs (she's clear!). She went ahead with the abortion after getting the all clear. A few days ago it was successfully carried out. They went for the surgical abortion method, which involved using a vacuum to suck the pregnancy out. GF said it was pretty painless, and she was able to return home after just a few hours. When she came home, she cried and cried and cried. She says she feels like a huge weight had been lifted, and she can finally look to moving on with her life. We took the whole week of work, and yesterday we went camping (it rained). While in the tent, she talked about how difficult life was sometimes, but she was really glad things turned out the way they did, because even though things were bad, she came out the other side, probably stronger than before. She's amazing, man. Seriously. Update on the Mum! So my GF received a call from her Mum, who was asking if she went through with the abortion. My GF and I have an agreement that if Mum calls, either hang up or give it to me. In this instance, she answered, didn't know what to say, and gave it to me. I told the Mum that the abortion went perfectly, and smiled as she cursed at me for about a minute. I then said ""How Jesus of you"" at which point she hung up. My GF didn't find it funny... Anyway, that's it. Good luck to everyone in their lives. Also, if you're going to message and insult me via PM, just be warned: I've killed ^a ^baby before.",
1403,"Raped in front of my girlfriend. feeling like giving up. I don't know what to say or do, I just feel like my life is falling apart. Three weeks ago My apartment was broken into by 4 strangers, my girlfriend was sleeping over. It was an awful, horrific long night, and she witnessed every single thing. 8 hours of prolonged humiliation and abuse. These 4 strangers destroyed me. They shredded every bit of self-esteem and sanity I had. After the hell they put me through, they simply left me there. bleeding heavily and stunned. My girlfriend was tied up screaming, but I didn't move. It took me a while to comprehend that this is now my reality and eventually get up. Weeks later, I am paranoid, unable to look at my reflection without feeling disgust, and I spend my time in my university lectures thinking about ending my life. I didn't tell a single soul about this because I feel so ashamed. I feel pathetic and weak. My girlfriend is the only one that knows, though everyone around has been telling me I've been ignoring them lately and calling me an asshole for it, yet I don't care. I just feel numb. I want to die, but I'm too afraid to say it out loud. That night they not only violently violated me, but they took something from me, a piece of my soul. Anyways, ever since that night my girlfriend has been acting different. she treats me differently, touches me differently, and most importantly she looks at me differently. A few days ago while we were sitting together, she told me that it's alright if this experience turns me ""gay"" and that we don't have to continue dating. this is coming from a 19 year old girl that has common sense, it all just made me feel really bad. It just reflected how after all this, how disgusting I feel was valid, that I am gross in her eyes now. Today is my birthday, I turn 20. I bailed on all the plans and decided to spend it alone. I'm sitting at home drinking alcohol and thinking about bashing my goddamn face in. I just feel alone in a way I never felt before. I just never thought this is where I'd be, that this would be my life. I hope I'm posting this in the correct place, I've only had Reddit when I was younger. thanks for listening for whoever is out there. Hopefully I'll feel better for writing this. UPDATE 1: Two of the assailants were caught by the police today. I’ll post a more detailed update in the next few days. Thank you everyone for this support. UPDATE 2: sorry I’m late with this, I’ve just been going through a lot. I’m gonna try to give everyone a bit of closure on everything that’s went down. The four assailants were part of a sex trafficking gang that my shitty dad got involved with and owed a lot of money. I’m not comfortable sharing the details of this specific aspect, but I hope this general explanation is enough. Two of them were caught and will be most likely going to prison as they plead guilty to avoid a trial. I’m currently trying to get myself together, but things have been getting worse and worse mentally. I’ve been going to gym, jogging and trying my best to not lose it, I didn’t start therapy, but I’m considering it. Me and my girlfriend broke up and there’s no bad blood. I just need to focus on myself. And again, thank you everyone for the immense support you’ve given me. You have no idea how much it saved me and made me feel a little less alone. Thank you.",
1405,"I manipulated, and raped my gf. Then I kicked her out of her own apartment.This is going to be a pretty heavy confession. I have never told anyone the full story. It makes me sick when I think about it. If you don't have a very jaded mind, click away from this. I am a sociopath. An event took place 4 years ago that caused me to ""snap"" into a reality that I had never realized. Since then I am no longer the callous, hateful, uncaring person I once was. The following is written in a first person view of how I thought at the time... I met a girl when I was 16. She was very attractive, but since she was rather sheltered and a hopeless romantic, it was easy to convince her to hook up with me. She loved me dearly. I loved her body. One year into our relationship and I discovered that she cheated on me. This was due to a mixture of things, the least of which was that she had started birth control pills and it was driving her hormones insane. I didn't care that she cheated, I cared that another human had fucked my **property**. I forced her to do all kinds of humiliating things in front of me while dangling her emotions and heartstrings. In front of her. I used this to begin her descent to a new hell. Over the years, I would have sex with her countless times in which she didn't want it. When she tried to refuse, I would strangle her until she would accept it. She bought an apartment and I moved in with her. I had a job, but liked mooching off of her money (she had a very sizable fund to relax on). After 4 years of living with her and abusing her daily, I got tired of her. I forced her to become a stripper/prostitute (she had to do what I say) and forced her to become a meth addict (literally made her use it at threats of violence). I had created a new form of nearly impenetrable blackmail. Her parents would cut her off of her money if they found out. They were extremely religious. Once she had a decent job going as a stripper to hide her new meth addiction spending, I renewed the lease with her money but cut her out of it. Signed on myself as the only leaser. I kicked her out with her belongings. To this day I have never told the entire truth of this story to anyone. It has been a very long time since this took place. Since changing, I have never lived a day that I did not regret my actions. They haunt my dreams, they haunt my life. I tried to commit suicide many times. I was too much of a coward to turn myself in and too much of a coward to kill myself. This will likely follow me for the rest of my life. I want to apologize to her so bad, but every time I think to contact her, I realize that she probably wants nothing more than to forget. My desire to apologize is selfish. I want peace. Closure. Her to know that I regret everything. She never recovered. I sometimes check on her Facebook. Her life is deep in the gutter. What was once a beautiful face is now the pitted, shallow face of a meth addict. Her life consists of moving from place to place, boyfriend to boyfriend. She never says anything happy anymore... I created this and I will never forgive myself.",
1406,"They told me I was evil, but I never understood why“Why can’t anyone besides me see the nagual?” I asked. Xolo smiled at me, but he was sad. “Invisible people are everywhere. Most choose to close their eyes and not see them.” Mamá was screaming. I peeked my head around Xolo so that I could see her better. She was holding Herminia’s head in her arms, rocking back and forth like my sister was still a baby. But Herminia was four year older than me, already twelve, and Señor Coyote said she looked like a woman. Señor Coyote was sitting next to a rock. “Chíngame, it’s hot.” He curled up in the tiny patch of shade. “We have to move, Mamacita, decide what you gonna do.” Mamá was still screaming, still rocking Herminia’s head back and forth, back and forth. White foam covered my sister’s lips like she had spilled milk, but we’d had nothing to drink all day. Then her head rolled to the side, and I saw that her eyes were wide open, and she didn’t move no matter how hard Mamá shook her. Xolo touched my chin, then gently turned my head around. He smiled again, and it was sad again. “Look away, Felicidad. Look away, and you can be safe.” * We walked faster without Herminia. She had been getting slower every day. “She will be happy?” I asked Xolo. “Callate!” Señor Coyote yelled at me. He was walking ahead of us because he knew the way, but he could still hear me. “Stop fucking talking to yourself.” He didn’t get angry when Xolo responded. No one else reacted when the nagual spoke. “Herminia doesn’t hurt now,” he answered. I didn’t understand, but I asked no more questions, because I did not want to make Señor Coyote angry. He stopped walking and grabbed Mamá’s hand. She leaned away. Xolo stopped walking and grabbed my hand. I leaned in. “Espera,” he ordered. Mamá held still. “This is Anima. The safe house is right there.” He smiled at Mamá, but it was an angry smile. “Págame.” Mamá hardly moved. She had barely spoken at all since we started walking faster. “$191.30 took me five years to save. We paid you everything, we owe nothing.” He pulled her close and smiled bigger, but it was still not a happy smile. “Págame. You or your daughter.” I understood that Mamá had broken after Herminia stayed behind, though she still stood tall. But she broke again when Señor Coyote took her behind the rocks, yet I didn’t understand why. “You don’t need to understand why,” Xolo said as he appeared. “You’re almost done walking. Look away and tell me about your new home.” I talked with Xolo for a long time before Mamá returned. Then she snatched me by the hand so hard that my shoulder hurt. She was angry, but I didn’t understand why. I asked her, but she didn’t say anything, and I realized that she was too broken to speak. * “Is it safe for me to sleep?” I asked Xolo, who was curled up in a ball next to me on the floor. “Shh,” he said. “Will it ever be safe for me to sleep?” “Close your eyes,” he responded softly. A woman screamed on the other side of the safe house. “Close your eyes,” he said. “Helado!” a man yelled. There was noise. The house had been filled with strangers before I went to sleep on the ground, and now new strange people were coming inside. The new strangers were afraid, just like the old ones had been, but they were afraid in a different way. A man picked me up and I did not like it. “Don’t worry,” he said, but I worried. “Espera!” Mamá screamed from the other room. “Wait! Please let me say goodbye!” The man took me outside. Mamá did not tell me goodbye. “Don’t worry, little girl,” the man said as he squeezed me and I felt sick, “you’re safe now.” * I never saw Mamá again. The boys and girls around me did not have parents either. I was glad to have Xolo with me. He lay down next to me when Officer Fallar made us get on the ground and face the floor. “God fucking damn it!” he liked to scream. “If you would just *behave*, you wouldn’t be in this situation. What’s it going to take?” Once, he stopped in front of me, and I could feel him staring. I looked up, even though I wasn’t supposed to. He smiled at me, but it wasn’t a friendly smile. “Just you wait, pretty girl,” he said in a voice like Señor Coyote. “Once the Flores decision gets reversed, we’ll be able to take care of you.” I put my head back on the floor. * *The other people on the floor were crying softly.* *I covered my eyes with my hand and Mamá hugged me close.* *“What’s it going to take?” the man shouted. “Barrio 18 will treat you well if you show us respect. Do we need to teach you respect?”* *He bent down and grabbed Francisco by the shoulder, then lifted him to his feet. Mamá pulled me closer, but she stayed on the ground.* *I was scared for my brother, because he was only fourteen, and I wanted to stand next to him so that he would not feel alone. But Xolo came to me then and rested his paw on my shoulder. “Don’t upset the man with a gun,” he whispered. “Always remember that.”* *“Does this boy need to be taught a lesson in respect so that the rest of you learn?” the gunman yelled.* *Mamá’s hot tears burned into my neck. She asked the Virgen de Suyapa to hold her, because she needed someone who would understand a mother’s pain.* *Xolo rested his paw gently on my face.* *“Close your eyes.”* * “What’s it going to take?” Officer Fallar repeated to the group of children assembled on the floor. “If you just show proper respect, we will go easier on you.” Two men lifted the boy who had been resisting and pulled him away from the rest of us. “God damn it,” he yelled in a quieter voice. “The problem is that you need to learn the fucking boundaries. *None* of you would be here if you hadn’t chosen to break the law in the first place.” * *Abuelita stroked Mamá’s hair as she rocked her daughter back and forth. Mamá wasn’t a baby, but I understood that she was Abuelita’s baby, so I said nothing.* *“We need to leave,” Mamá whispered. Her voice was so frail that it sounded ready to shatter like clay.* *“Please wait,” Abuelita begged. “Follow the rules, wait your turn.”* *“Francisco followed the rules. I can’t spend two daughters to follow the same path.”* *“You can take them when there is room. Be patient.” Abuelita stroked her hair. She was trying not to cry.* *“They tell us there is no room unless we win a lottery,” Mamá whispered, “but they are playing a game with us. There is always room in a place filled with hope.” Mamá wiped her eyes. “There are so many jobs working in the fields that they cannot fill them all, and only immigrants will take them. But if I wait for someone to tell me it’s my turn, I’ll die first.” She turned around and looked at Abuelita with sad eyes.* *“They want us to come, just not as equals.”* * “Be careful,” Xolo warned me. “What for?” I asked in confusion. “I’m just getting out of my cot to use the toilet.” He looked scared. “Be very careful, Felicidad.” I got up and awkwardly walked through the maze of children on the floor. It’s easier to find my way to the bathroom when they keep the lights on, but it’s harder to sleep. No one wanted to use the bathroom at night – at least the girls didn’t. So there was no line for the toilet. The flusher was broken, so I left everything sitting in the bowl when I finished. I was thirsty, so I stood up on the toilet. The sink was part of the seat where we pee and poop, but I was too small to reach it, so I always had to stand on the toilet seat to get water. I tried to put my face in the sink, but someone had pooped on the seat and not cleaned it, so my feet slipped. I fell and landed in the toilet, and it soaked deep into my socks. I didn’t like how warm it felt. But I remembered Herminia, and I felt very, very thirsty, so I reached my head as far forward as I could to get to the sink. Slow footsteps walked up behind me. That didn’t make sense, because no one liked using the bathroom at night. It was the soft *click clack* of a man’s shoes. I was still trying to drink. But Xolo grabbed my hand. The footsteps stopped behind me. I turned around. It was Officer Fallar. He smiled, but it wasn’t friendly, and I wasn’t happy. “Looks like the Flores restrictions end tonight,” he whispered. Xolo was weeping. No one else was nearby. Officer Fallar walked toward me. “Look away, and close your eyes,” Xolo said as Officer Fallar stroked my cheek. Xolo sobbed openly, warm tears falling down his distant cheeks, as he let go of my hand. “Close your eyes.” _____________________________ [FB](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/) [BD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/) [Listen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcn_pa1QfNMRzbTuJqXSoRQ?view_as=subscriber)",
1407,"Black/African American experiences with coming out and thereafterSo I’m a black guy [M,19 in July, woohoo!] who’s been out for a year now officially. I don’t know any other gay black men and the one I know of in my family I don’t have contact with. I’m really curious as to how your experiences with coming out and your life afterwards has been in reference to your family and friends. My mother has turned out to be very accepting and supportive (even going as far as to talk to me about seeing “Love Simon” as soon as she left the movies) but my father... well, it’s taking time. Last summer was, to put it lightly, horrible. Full disclosure, after an embarrassing event with a sex toy, he want ballistic, saying I was going to end up raped and dead in a ditch somewhere (and used every gay slur imaginable). What was really a small issue unfolded into a hate filled, months long tirade that only ended when I left for my first year of college. Since leaving home, he’s seems to have gotten a lot better, things are normal now, but he never brings up my sexuality in conversation and never refers to it. Maybe this has nothing to do with race, idk. I’ve got only a slight idea of how being gay is viewed in the black community and would like to no more. I appreciate any comments or information you all want to share. It’s been a years long process of recovering and learning not hate him with every fiber of my being.",
1409,"She Didn't Get AwayI can tell you now, with miserable certainty, that it is better to live in ignorant mediocrity. Like every burgeoning young man my age, I recently began questioning the foundations of my habits and beliefs - structures built haphazardly by muddling through adolescence without any real aspirations or guidance. It was time to clean up my act, time to get serious, time to man up… and that meant finally getting free of my medications. I couldn't remember a time before my numerous daily pills, as I had simply always taken them, and they kept my early memories hazy and unreliable. I had a vague notion of the various conditions that the pills were meant to control, but, as I became more of what I felt was an adult, I began feeling that I could manage without them. I'd already told my doctor this on several occasions throughout the last year, but, each time, he told me that we should wait and see. Last week, I confronted him as much as I dared, asking if it was safe to begin dropping my doses… because I was going to do it with or without his permission. I'd been going to him for checkups my entire life, but I don't think I'd ever seen him react quite so… oddly. He stepped back, and seemed to be considering something with a deep frown. It took him a full minute to respond, but, when he finally did, it was only to tell me that we should still wait and see. I asked him what, exactly, we were waiting for. He hesitated again… only to subsequently tell me that doctor-patient confidentiality prevented him from discussing it. Confused, I asked him to elaborate, but he refused. I asked him what, exactly, my medications were for. For once, he didn't give me a spiel about anxiety, or ADHD, or depression, or any of the other litany of diagnoses I'd cycled through as I'd grown. He simply told me to… ask my grandfather. With a sense of unease gnawing at my gut, I left, and contacted him. This attempt at self-determination had all been born of regret at a foggy, lazy, and wasted youth, and I blame much of that on my dad. He'd tried valiantly to raise me right, but his job had kept him gone at all hours for most of each week, so I'd been mostly left to my own devices. Aside from various neighborhood misadventures with the wrong crowd, I'd spent much of my time next door at my grandfather's house. He was a jolly, kind-hearted man with a subtle heaviness behind his eyes that I'd always suspected came from the effort of taking care of my grandmother. Contacting him for a conversation like this could only mean I was about to learn some unhappy family history. She sat on the porch as I arrived under the glow of early evening. She subtly engaged her rocking chair as I approached, the only indication she ever gave that she was aware of me. She just stared ahead absently as I kissed her on the forehead, said hello, and then proceeded inside the aging house they'd lived in for as long as my murky memories could recall. My grandfather sat on a stool in the kitchen, that unspoken burden plainly visible on his face. I knew immediately that my fears had been right. I sat on the stool opposite. He sighed. ""I've been dreading this conversation, but there's no avoiding it. Has your father ever mentioned how your mother died?"" ""No…"" I replied, a heavy weight settling in around my chest. ""Well, how to put this…"" He turned his head to watch my grandmother through the window for a long moment. ""Before this house, we lived on a farm. I'd inherited it from my father, who'd helped his father build the whole thing back when land was cheap and towns were few and far between."" I nodded. I'd heard a hushed mention of the farm once or twice in whispered conversations between relatives. Did everyone in the family know except me? My grandfather looked down at his hands as he continued, his voice low. ""I didn't know what it was the first few times it came around."" I sat up straight. ""It?"" He curled his wrinkled, work-worn fingers into fists. ""I should have shot it that first night… I had the family hunting rifle, and it seemed disoriented. One shot straight to the…"" He held up his right hand about eight inches from his head and moved it back and forth, indicating some unknown oversized curvature. ""One shot, and your mother might have…"" He shook his head. ""No, no, I can't get sucked into regret again."" He finally stopped staring angrily at his hands, instead looking me in the eye. ""Regret is a luxury. You just have to deal, and get by. That's what this family has always done."" I was receptive to his message in a vague sense, but my horrified fascination remained solely on the past trauma to my family that I had always suspected. ""*What was it?*"" ""I've wracked my brain for years trying to make sense of it - of *him*,"" he responded. ""It was a man… it was definitely a man, if not in the sense that you and I know."" I understood from his tone that he meant that it was aware - that it was not simply some horrible animal. ""It looked me in the eye, that first night,"" he whispered. ""Right at me, acknowledging me, sizing me up. It had these two horrific, beady -"" He paused, set his jaw for a moment, then switched tack. ""All I really took away from that encounter were the arms."" ""The arms?"" I asked, eyes wide. ""The one thought I remember most clearly: *that's a spider leg.* Jointed, eerily smooth segments glimmering under my light… but it wasn't a spider leg. It was an arm. It lifted that arm against the sudden light, and backed away. That arm… had fingers… five fingers, so human, but not… with little pointed blades on the end of each…"" I had a sudden sense of disassociation as I pulled away from the description in disgust and revulsion for a moment. Part of me wanted to laugh away this impossible *thing* in the woods near the family farm, but my grandfather seemed deadly serious. ""I froze, and it ran,"" he continued. ""But it came back… every few nights, testing the edges of the farm, watching us from between the trees at night…"" ""Did you get help?"" I asked, feeling his helpless fear as if it was still ongoing. ""Yes, once we found the first kill - one of our cows, left hanging from a tree by thick, sticky threads, its inner organs dissolved and… *sucked out somehow.* That was enough evidence, and our neighbors had seen it, too. We got the boys, and we went hunting."" I gripped the table, unhappily already aware of how this story was going to end. ""Did you find it?"" ""Yes,"" he said with a sigh, and I saw that weight on his soul more clearly than ever. ""But only near dawn, on the way back home. It was trying to leave our farm… we shot it a dozen times each, then took a sledgehammer to it when it wouldn't stop screeching… and then we burned that godforsaken corpse for good measure… but we were too late."" ""It'd already been to the house…"" He nodded sadly. ""In the end, I think that *she* was what it really wanted."" Finally putting the pieces of my mother's death together, I could only feel a sense of empty resolution. From all the whispered conversations and sad faces I'd seen, that horrible fate was the only one that made sense. Was that why I was on meds that made me forget? Had I been there, as a baby? Had I… *seen it?* I did have the strangest sense that I knew what he was talking about, a strangely clear image in my head of a creature only barely described… My life was finally starting to make sense. I turned and looked through the window at my grandma. She must have seen it, too… must have seen it murder my mother and… do to her, what it did to that cow… and that's why she'd turned inward, why she'd been mentally absent my entire life… thinking out the logistics of the horrific attack, I realized my grandmother must have grabbed me and rescued me… ""How did she get away?"" I asked, heart pounding. My grandfather blinked. ""I'm sorry?"" ""How did Grandma get away from the thing from the woods? Was it too busy attacking my mom?"" He narrowed his eyes unhappily. ""I don't think you quite understand… your grandmother didn't get away."" I turned away from watching her to look back at him in confusion. ""Then how did she survive? How did I survive? If it killed my mother -"" He grabbed my wrist, his tone deadly insistent. ""Your grandmother didn't escape - but it wasn't there to kill her."" ""What are you saying?"" I asked, trying to pull away from his painful grip. ""You weren't there. Your mother wasn't there. This was many more years ago than you're thinking. The vile thing wasn't there to kill your grandmother. It -"" He paused, fighting a body-shaking tremble to continue. ""It had horrific, beady, *yellow* eyes."" I pulled away harder, but he wouldn't let me go. ""No!"" ""Yes!"" he shouted. ""And that's why you have to take your goddamn pills! Your mother didn't have the luxury of modern medicine, and when she was a little older than you…"" He seemed to take in a painful breath… and let me go. A sense of despairing calm settled over me. I understood, in that moment. I had more questions, but they could wait. With a grim nod, I departed my grandfather's aging house, and left my grandmother with a parting kiss on the forehead and a whispered apology. I walked calmly to my house, went inside, entered the bathroom, locked the door, and proceeded to take all of my needed pills. The experience of taking so many pills - recently increasingly tiresome - now felt religiously important.

1413,"My girlfriend raped me and idk how to deal with itI don't want to go up into a huge description of how it happened. I just wanted it off my chest. I was young and helpless, and she took advantage of me. Now I can't trust anyone. It's not that I hate women, or anyone, for that matter. It's just I don't trust them. I did a throwaway because I don't even trust my main account for this. It's scary to admit that you were taken advantage of, because you never know how it's going to turn out. And especially if you're a man, I feel like people just don't care. But she raped me. And it makes me feel small, and ashamed, and I don't know how to deal with it. I don't trust women now. Not because I have a predisposition against them, but because..it really messed me up. I just needed someone to know. Even if I can't say it with my own name. Edit: Since I feel more confident now after realizing it's a throwaway, I guess I'll elaborate. I was too drunk to move. I kept telling her no, and kept trying to shove her off of me, but I was too weak to keep her off. Thing progressed and then after she told me that ""obviously I was into it"" since I got hard. It could have happened to anyone, because she stimulated me. But I, personally, didn't want it, and I wasn't fully consience. It just felt wrong. Afterwards I was shamed for how ""bad"" I was in bed and I fucking hate it. Nobody has ever listened to me. I just wanted it off my chest.",

1418,"[Update] My [25M] girlfriend [22F] told me she was forcibly raped and now I don’t feel comfortable having sex with her anymore.[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/es8jy7/my_25m_girlfriend_22f_told_me_she_was_forcibly/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) So since reading all the responses, I decided to just talk to her. I made it absolutely clear that I didn’t see her as anything less than I did before but that I just felt how I described in the other post. She was pretty understanding. I also asked if she’d be comfortable if I came to one or two of her therapy sessions. I made it clear that if she didn’t want to, I wouldn’t push it. She was kinda quiet at first but decided that it would be beneficial. So I went last week and really just talked with her and her therapist. I also talked with the therapist in private. Basically, the points made in the last post about how consensual sex with a loved one is liberating were echoed there. A few other points were brought up as well, but I’d rather not mention those on a public forum. A lot of you were saying in the other post how I was making her trauma about me and that this is why some people don’t want to share their past. It was never my intention to do that, and I apologize if that’s how I came off. Her therapist actually recommended some people I could go and see. Finding out that the girl I love had been through so much abuse isn’t just something I could shrug off. And like I said before, I absolutely don’t see her as ‘broken’ or ‘damaged.’ It’s just incredibly saddening to know she had to endure so much suffering. Clearly it’s something that still affects her years later, and I just want to be there for her. She’s always been there for me. I love her.",
1419,"(TW: Rape) DM has my character raped while knocked unconscious. He and the entire party are aware that the DM's younger brother raped me a year ago.Update at end of post Tldr: DMs younger brother raped me a year ago (he and entire party knows) and tonight he decided that my character was raped and upon a failed med check suffers from a heart attack. Tonight was probably my last time with DND for a while. I was in a campaign with 4 of my one time roommates (I'm the only female), and while a normally DM for the group, one of the guys wants to try this campaign. DM is also my ex's older brother. The night wasn't going swell from the start. Four level 5 characters all rolling pretty low with lots of Nat 1's with the consequences being such as dropping or losing weapons. I start casting AOE spells against our 3 enemies, and even though the spells cast I'm told they have no effect, with the reason being ""DM overule"". Fine, I'll start melee attacking. DM has nearest BG attack me, breaks my armor and drops me from full health +25 temp hit points to -15hp. DM makes a roll behind the screen and tells me ""The Lizardfolk BG grabs your leg while you're unconscious and pulls you away from the battle and your teammates and begins to rape you. Make the first of your saving throws."" I look at him completely astounded, the whole group knowing that his younger brother who I dated for almost two years raped me while we were together and that's why I left. At this point I was about to leave and the one guy begged saying it's just a game, see where it goes it could be a plot point... Pissed, I just said fine and rolled my save, Nat 20, I regain consciousness. DM has me roll a Medicine check to see how injured I am, I Nat 1. ""Your character has a heart attack, you're incapacitated again."" At that point I just left and walked home, honestly I'm just happy my character is dead now. Update: Thank you all for the support, this post was mainly supposed to be an outlet for the frustration I was feeling immediately after the session. For those asking why I was friends with his friends and family after what happened, well they effectively removed him from my life and his brother was at one point very supportive. They kicked him out of the house and in general have been supportive of me since the loss of my father and through the now declining health of my mother. But in no uncertain terms, that is no longer the case after last night. I have another campaign that was scheduled to start this Wednesday evening with completely different players that is now on hold until I can collect myself. I plan on trying to run this campaign because they don't deserve to have their fun ruined due to another unrelated campaign. As some people have pointed out, yes this account is not my main, it is supposed to be for ""meal prep only"". I posted here because first of all, I'm relatively active on other DM subreddits like r/DMAcademy and r/DNDnext as well as others and would like to keep the history in this post away from the friends I've made as well as my family. Additionally my soon to be new players also met me on there and if rather keep my personal history away from most general knowledge.",
1420,"My [25M] girlfriend [22F] told me she was forcibly raped and now I don’t feel comfortable having sex with her anymore.Edit 3: I should reiterate, it wasn’t *just* rape. She was also hit many times. Would it be bad to ask her if she’d be comfortable is I went to one of her sessions? Edit 2: I’ve had a chance to read the top comments and some controversial ones and I just wanted to say, for those of you saying that I’m selfish for making her rapes about me, do you actually think that I want to do that? Do you think I want to make her feel broken? The whole reason I asked this in the first place is because I don’t. From my perspective, this act that I enjoy doing with her so much has also caused her intense trauma in the past. It was eye opening getting to hear from people who have experienced this first had. She’s typically a really understanding person so I think I’ll communicate to her how I feel and make it clear that I don’t feel that way in any bad faith. We’ll see how things go from there. Edit: I’ve been at work all day and just saw how big this blew up. I read through some of the DMs but won’t be able to read the comment until later. Thanks guys, except those of you who left shitty DMs. — Original First of all, I don’t mean it in the way it sounds. I mean that I feel like I’m hurting her by having sex with her. So my girlfriend of 1.5yrs told me last week how she was forcibly raped multiple times and physically abused by her boyfriend in high school. When she told me this I kinda broke out in tears that she had to go through all of that. She told me since been in therapy for it for a long time. I knew she went, but I never asked about what it was for. The thing is now, I feel so bad about what happened that I don’t feel comfortable having sex with her. I know this is different because it’s 10000% consensual but I feel like I’m just violating and hurting her now when we have sex. I know this isn’t true, but I can’t shake this feeling. How can I get past this?",

A mix of relief, anger, and guilt. I was raped by a family member several years ago. I was drunk and I was convinced by my family that I wanted it and It was my fault because I was drunk. I was newly 21 and young and stupid. My mom told me not to tell my dad because it would kill him. When my boyfriend found out and threatened to kill my rapist, my mom told me it was my responsibility to get my boyfriend under control. I never went to the police because I thought if my own mother won’t believe me how would anyone else. Today I found out he raped someone else. He is being charged with felony rape on the other side of the country. How my family reacts to this will make or break my relationship with them. I feel relieved that I now have validation that I was raped and hopefully he will finally face some consequences. I am angry that my family didn’t believe me and convinced me it was my fault for drinking. And i feel guilty that I didn’t press charges and that this happened to someone else.

1432,"I got raped last nightThrowaway and omitting/changing some details for obvious reasons, but I'm posting here to try to help myself cope as /r/gaybros doesn't allow new users to post. I'm a guy in my late 20s who has always been pretty cautious with my dating life/hookups. I've done some stupid shit in the past, but nothing to this level. Long story short, I went on a date with a guy I've been talking to for a few days prior. We seemed to hit it off and I felt like we were really vibing at dinner. He invites me over to his place to watch a movie, and one thing leads to another and we start having sex. We did foreplay, tested things out to see what was gonna work, and he ultimately decided he wanted to be the top to finish things off. I say okay, I haven't bottomed in a while but I'm willing to try, but only if he wears a condom. He respects my wishes and gets a condom out and proceeds to finger, rim, and eventually enter me. We take a few breaks and he continues to reenter me to try again. On the fifth or so attempt, I start to realize that something was off. I tell him to stop, he pulls out, and I notice he secretly took the condom off. I push him off and tell him to stop, as I specifically told him I didn't want to be fucked without a condom. I'm on PrEP but that isn't a 100% chance of success, and other STIs can easily be transmitted while taking it. He apologizes and says ""he didn't realize,"" and we continue with foreplay and handjobs to try to get off. A few minutes later he says let me try again, and I say ONLY if you get another condom out. He does, and he starts again but then I notice him try to slip it off midway. I push him off again I tell him I'm gonna leave as he isn't respecting my boundaries. As I'm getting up, he flips out and pushes me down towards the bed, his hand around my throat and forcibly enters me. He gets a few thrusts in before I come to terms with what's going on and manage to overpower him back. I quickly grab my stuff and got the fuck out, all while he was screaming ""I'm sorry, I'm on PrEP it's okay!"" I immediately call my friend and tell him about what happened. He encourages me to call the police, and after some thinking and talking while driving home I agree with him. I get taken into the local police station and go through all the procedures. They take me to the hospital to get a rape kit and get examined. Everyone was courteous and completely empathetic, but my mind was all over the place. The whole process took about 6 hours. Today, I woke up with the intent to continue my normal routine. Go to the gym, go to work, get everything I needed to do done. But as I was driving to the gym I noticed that tears kept swelling up and I couldn't control myself from crying. I immediately head home and call the crisis hotline they give me because I was sure I was getting a panic attack of some sort (I've never had one before so I had no idea what to expect). They tell me to take off work so I do. I kept bawling so I took melatonin to sleep everything off until now. At this moment, I don't know how to cope. I never expected something like this would happen to me. I'm a healthy male in my late 20s who has his life (more or less) put together. I stay as fit as I can, as social as I can, as kind as I can, but right now I feel a terrifying indifference. Like if my life ended right now I wouldn't even care. I'm not suicidal necessarily, but everything just looks and feels different. It's surreal. I haven't told my close friends and family, and I don't think I ever will. I don't want to be seen as a victim or be given pity parties. The whole investigation just rubbed me the wrong way because of the wording they were using. The word victim, the word suspect, the ""I'm sorrys."" I just couldn't handle it for some reason. I know they were trying to empathize with me but I couldn't help but think that all saw me as this helpless, stupid person who put himself in this situation and was/is wasting everyone's time. Right now my mind is racing through so many things. Did the guy give me anything? Will my PrEP prevent me from contracting HIV? How will the investigation proceed? Will I have to see him again? What if I bump into him grocery shopping or running or hanging out with my friends? I have an event tonight I'm supposed to attend for my friend, but I don't even know if I could muster the energy to do that. I'm crying randomly and uncontrollably, and don't really know how to proceed. I just wish I could go back to normal. I don't even know what to do therapy-wise. I'm genuinely surprised I could even muster the energy to type this out semi-coherently, but it is definitely therapeutic to have everything in writing. Have any of you gone through something like this? How did you cope? How long did it take for everything to get back to normal?",

1438,"I just found out my sister's friend was raped and IJust got off the phone with my sister and I am shaking from anger and I don't know what else to do so I'm writing this. My sister has a friend back home, Anna (fake name obviously). For the past few months Anna has been telling my sister and our mom (Anna and our mom are close because our mom has a ""any friend of my kid is my kid too"" mindset) about the harassment she endured at work from a coworker. Inappropriate comments about her (very appropriate) work outfits, cat calling, attempts of touching her (at work), explicit text messages and ultimately some angry insults. My mom and sister were naturally very concerned and advised Anna to report him to management and to show the text messages to the police. My sister even told about all of this to some of her very-lovely-but-rides-a-big-motorcycle-and-trains-MMA guy friends who offered ""to have a chat"" with the coworker. But Anna didn't want to ""cause trouble"" because he has a wife and three young children. Besides, initially she tried telling her boss but the only response she got was ""eh, leave him alone and dont be such a flirt"" so there was nothing to be done besides avoiding him. Well, tonight Anna gathered the courage and told my sister what actually happened. He raped her a couple of months ago. He drugged her, raped her, and possibly took photos. And then he blackmailed her, telling her he would distribute the photos if she didn't sleep with him. Y'all. I am seeing red. I am shaking. I hate this world. Anna has been living in shame. Anna has been blaming herself. Anna is unable to wear a dress without feeling disgusted with herself. Anna still doesn't want to ""cause trouble"" and is concerned what would happen to his children. Anna has quit her job. Anna was afraid my sister will ""think of her as a whore"" and that's why she hasn't said anything untill now - my sister is the only person she has confided in (my sister told me because she wants Anna to come and stay with us for a while) I am crying. How can a somebody (I can't even say a person) do this to a human being? How is it possible that Anna is more concerned about her rapists children than their own father is? Why can't I hang him by the balls in the town square? This is infuriating, this is terrible and this is terryfing. There is not much that can be done and that is what makes my blood boil. This monster raped a person and continues his life without a care in the world. He crushed a person's self-esteem and doesn't lose sleep. But Anna and other rape victims have to find some way to deal with all the shame, disgust and pain. My sister and I will do anything and everything to help Anna get her life back but I am angry she will probably never get justice. *Edit* Firstly, I wanted to thank all the rape survivors and people whose friends have gone through something similar for sharing your stories and kind advice in the comments. While I am deeply saddened by the fact that you went through hell, your courage and strength gives me hope that Anna will get through this and eventually carry on. Second, thank you to all the people who shared advice about going to the police and seeking legal support. I completely agree with you. While I would gladly go and file a report this second, it is not my place to make that decision. Anna needs to be the one to do so and if she ultimately chooses not to, we will still support her and help her in any way we can. And finally, I also want to say thank you to all of you who asked about our home town and offered to come visit the guy. Reading your comments somehow made me feel a bit better in a strange way. I don't know if I will be able to update you about the development of the situation, not sure what is going to happen but I can say that Anna will come and stay with my sister and me for a while and hopefully that would be a good start. I now need to find some coffee and get ready for work. Once again, thank you all for your advice and support!",

Among them, many women claimed that they were sexually harassed or even assaulted by HK police. Yesterday, a piece of information came out that a 16-year-old teenager was gang-raped by the police while she was in police custody, got pregnant, and was forced to have an abortion and forced to remain silent. About this, an ER doctor working at the hospital confirmed on his Facebook page. He also claimed that complaints have been filed against him, and that he is receiving death threats. A HK internet user [disclosed this scandal](https://lihkg.com/thread/1700885/page/1) on[ lihkg.com](http://lihkg.com/) yesterday (the 8th), stating that a young woman was arrested during one of the protests, and that while she was in police custody, she was raped by multiple police officers, and unfortunately got pregnant. This post also stated that she had an abortion surgery yesterday at the Elizabeth Hospital. According to this internet user, this incident has spread widely among the medical professionals; he/she also swore on his/her entire families’ lives that everything in the post was true. Today, an ER doctor made a post on his Facebook page “[Dr. Ray’s Emergency Room Journey.](https://www.facebook.com/dr.ray.on.call/posts/1404352349705828)” He stated that he already knew about it last week, and now this news “is like a fire that can no longer be concealed by paper”. He said that he is not the person who made the post on[ lihkg.com](http://lihkg.com/), but he already had complaints filed and death threats made against him. “But I believe that even if I fall down, there will be thousands of my colleagues who will continue to blow this whistle, just like now” In the end, he also pleaded people in Hong Kong to not surround the hospital, because the medical professionals are put in a tight spot, that they are not able to “open their mouths”. He called for people in Hong Kong to convert their anger into support for the victims. “Hospital is a place for reasons and is not a battleground; I hope everyone can share their opinions peacefully” In this post, he also shared [another scandal-disclosing post](https://www.facebook.com/hasecretspage/posts/2458946840894022?__tn__=K-R). Besides stating what happened to this 16 year old teenage girl, this other post also stated that there are attorneys looking into this incident, DNA sample collected, and that an investigation is underway.” Edit: typos Edit 2: new post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dufj7z/video_proofs_that_hong_kong_police_may_be/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)",

1467,"I’m a Florida journalist who found out sheriff's deputies have been inappropriately clearing some rape casesHey, I’m Allison Ross of the *Tampa Bay Times*. I’ve been looking at how rape cases get [cleared without an arrest](https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2020/01/05/how-the-pinellas-sheriffs-office-boosts-its-rape-stats-without-solving-cases/), following a [2018 investigation](https://www.propublica.org/article/when-it-comes-to-rape-just-because-a-case-is-cleared-does-not-mean-solved) by ProPublica, Newsy and Reveal. When police have enough evidence to make an arrest but can't for reasons outside of their control, they can use the ""exceptionally cleared"" category. From 2014-2018, the Pinellas sheriff's office reported more than 750 rapes to the state and feds. It said it cleared 440 cases, but **only** **111 ended in arrest** — the rest were exceptionally cleared. The agency said victims didn’t want to move forward. Experts say that isn’t unusual. Looking at a random sample of those cases, I found some that were counted as cleared *before* authorities had investigated enough to make an arrest. Two experts reviewed a dozen files for the *Times*, and they found missed investigative opportunities and failures to meet best practices in handling sexual assault cases.

According to the CDC, [nearly 1 in 4 men](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/sexualviolence/fastfact.html) report sexual violence involving physical contact in their lifetime. The [CDC also states](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf): &#x200B; >Being made to penetrate someone else includes times when the victim was made to, or there was an attempt to make them, sexually penetrate someone without the victim’s consent because the victim was physically forced (such as being pinned or held down, or by the use of violence) or threatened with physical harm, or when the victim was drunk, high, drugged, or passed out and unable to consent. - > >... > > > > Among men, **being made to penetrate someone else could have occurred in multiple ways: being made to vaginally penetrate a female using one’s own penis; orally penetrating a female’s vagina or anus**; anally penetrating a male or female; **or being made to receive oral sex from a male or female**. It also includes male and female perpetrators attempting to force male victims to penetrate them, though it did not happen. [They also found](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf): &#x200B; >Nearly 1 in 5 women (18.3%) and **1 in 71 men (1.4%) in the United States have been raped at some time in their lives, including completed forced penetration, attempted forced penetration, or alcohol/drug facilitated completed penetration.** &#x200B; Unless it is male on male rape, most of these cases go unreported. Additionally, there have been numerous cases of women teachers who commit statutory rape by having sex with their students (such as [Mary Kay Letourneau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Kay_Letourneau)). Indeed, the same CDC report shows: > **More than one-quarter of male victims of completed rape (27.8%) experienced their first rape when they were 10 years of age or younger.** &#x200B; A paper published in [Aggression and Violent Behavior](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178916301446?via%3Dihub) found: >This article examines female sexual perpetration in the U.S. To do so, we analyzed data from four large-scale federal agency surveys conducted independently by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2008 through 2013. **We found these data to contradict the common belief that female sexual perpetration is rare**. We therefore reviewed the broader literature to identify patterns and provide context, including among high-risk populations such as college students and inmates. We recommend that professionals responding to this problem avoid gender stereotypes that downplay the frequency and impact of female sexual perpetration so as to comprehensively address sexual victimization in all forms. [HM Government](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/783996/Male_Victims_Position_Paper_Web_Accessible.pdf) found that it takes males roughly 31 YEARS before they come forward. Bottom line: Men can be raped by women and it happens far more often than commonly believed. We ought to take men seriously when they claim to have been raped, whether they were raped by a male or a female. Thank you for coming to my ted talk.",

The person I told everything to: about that bad grade I got, my grandmas cancer, the boy I liked, my eating disorder. Everything. When you told me you have a crush on me, I panicked. I didn’t want to lose this. I didn’t feel the same for you and didn’t want to lose my best friend. 6 years ago, you took something you’ve wanted for so long from me. You made sure that I was drunk enough to not fight back, took my clothes off and put some music on so you didn’t have to hear me crying. You don’t know what happened after that. You don’t know that I went home, didn’t eat, drink or speak to anyone for days. You don’t know that I couldn’t let my first boyfriend touch me for weeks because I had a panic attack every time he tried. You don’t know how many therapy sessions it took for me to finally be able to speak about it without choking on my own tears.

I never told the police, by the point I accepted that it’s happened I thought it was too late. It took me a year to tell my female best friend. Three years to tell my mum, because I knew it would break her heart. Four years to be able to speak about without crying. I’m good now. I’m coping. Today it’s been 6 years.

1480,"Is it deceitful to indicate the loss of my virginity was separate from my rape?Okay, so long story short, I was raped when I was 13. I don’t consider this a loss of virginity. It was a physical sexual attack that was not my choice. I *willingly* lost my virginity to my boyfriend at 18. Because that was MY choice and we decided together. There’s plenty of people who know of my rape at the age of 13 and call me out when I indicate that I lost my virginity at 18 when talking to my kids about abstinence or just in general. Even when talking about my first sexual experience they say things like “But, you weren’t a virgin”, “He wasn’t your first”, “Weren’t you raped at 13?”. Like whoa guys. Rape and my virginity have always been two very *very* separate things. And I don’t see how it’s their business or place to correct me on it. My boyfriend at 18 was MY first. It was MY choice. And I will always refer to that experience as MY first time. Am I wrong to do this? I’m starting to get extremely annoyed by the constant corrections. Am I really lying? I sure don’t feel I’m in the wrong here. **EDIT** To those who have messaged me wondering why I talk about my virginity inviting these types of conversations.... I am a sexual person, aren’t most? I openly discuss my sexual experiences with those I’m close with (friends/intimate partners) and have never felt shame doing so. It’s not like I go around asking all my co-workers about their first time. But sex is not a taboo topic to me, is it to you? I’ve mentored young girls who were victims of adolescent rape or sexual assault. We’d talk openly about personal boundaries, abstinence, safe sex, and how to say no. These are healthy conversations to have and every parent/guardian should absolutely take the time to have this talk with their young ones! IT IS NOT WRONG OR SHAMEFUL TO DO SO. **EDIT 2** This got way more attention than I ever expected it to. TIL; virginity is a bullshit social construct and we all have an individual right to define it for ourselves. Also, I need better friends.",

They moved the priests around to avoid controversy and prosecution and allowed them to continue giving out the very same sacrament in question today. Rape some kids? No big deal, go to mass and administer the sacrament. Dare to vote yes on a bill that protects a woman's right to choose? No Jesus blood for you, sinner! The values here are clear...

Allow me to share my story, and hopefully help someone else with their journey.* I have made a few posts on here before. **This one will be the motherload. I hope it gets some views, because I am about to spend a lot of time on this post lol.** *Get ready for a wall of text* So - SUPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP MY FELLOW LOSERS (see what i did there?) My name is Daniel. I am 25, 5'7"", living in Toronto, Canada and weighing in - PROUDLY - at a 169, with 17% body fat. I started my journey 8 months ago, in September, after I ballooned up to the fattest I have ever been, 240 pounds and 35% body fat. First thing is first, the reason everyone is here. The pictures. **I apologize in advance, HAIRY HAIRY MAN with small amounts of clothing on.** [Before](http://i.imgur.com/oVBgMeC.jpg) [Current 1](http://i.imgur.com/GPFiK74h.jpg) [Current 2](http://i.imgur.com/tgAlnf6h.jpg) [Current 3](http://i.imgur.com/Nvu9eJ5h.jpg) I am no where near where I want to be - but I am really happy with my progression and how far I have come. Next goal.. ABS!!!!!!!! **Now - to the real reason I am here - Helping people achieve their goals.** I basically replaced my passion for gaming with a passion for fitness/health. A little history about me. From the age of 8-13 I played competitive sports. I played baseball VERY competitively, but got injured. It was when I was forced to stop playing competitive baseball that I turned to an addiction of video games and unhealthy food. I would spend hours in front of the computer playing games. I did this for years, to a point where I actually started playing competitively and even ""professionally"" (I was actually getting money to play video games.. pretty sweet right!?) This filled my competitive side. Unfortunately for me - It led to an increasingly sedentary lifestyle. I would be glued to the computer, eating incredibly unhealthy foods at my desk, quickly (inhaling them as fast as i can), and filling myself with sugary drinks like coke and sprite. When I say unhealthy foods.. I mean it - Pizzas, burgers, wings, pizza pockets, mcdonalds, etc, fast food was my life. I saw a picture of myself at my girlfriends (now ex) birthday party.. And to put it politely - I was disgusted with how fat I had become. I knew I had to make a change. 3 years prior to now, I went from 220->170. After getting too comfortable, and getting a girlfriend, I let everything go. I stopped working out (from p90x 6 times a week to 0), stopped eating healthy and started treating myself to all the garbage I worked so hard to stay away from. I went from treating myself on Fridays, to Fri/Sat/Sun.. Right back to my old ways. Depression sank in again. I was the saddest I had ever been in my life. I lost the weight once..I knew I could do it again. **THIS TIME, I HAD TO MAKE IT STICK** Now - My tips on losing weight. I am by no means an expert, but this worked for me - TWICE now.. So I think it's safe to say these are the basics that can help anyone. * Calories in vs calories out. This is everything. You need to either determine your TDEE/BMR on a site like **[this](http://www.freedieting.com/tools/calorie_calculator.htm)** I have tried every style of eating - from low carb, to no carb, to high fat, to low fat, to intermittent fasting.. In my opinion it really doesn't matter. Eat clean, healthy foods.. Figure out your caloric deficit for losing weight, stick to that number.. And you're golden. * This brings me to bullet number 2. www.myfitnesspal.com - Sign up, and start tracking your calories. And I mean track them properly - weigh your foods. I used to think I was eating around 2k per day.. I put in my average daily food, it was almost 3500. Huge wake up call. * Cut out all the garbage foods/drinks you know you shouldn't be eating/drinking. This means all processed crap, fast food, snacks, sugary drinks and replace it with CLEANER, HEALTHIER OPTIONS. This means lots of LEAN PROTEIN (chicken breast, fish, turkey breast, lean cuts of meat), a lot of vegetables, and LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS OF WATER. There are many options for food - I will post my full guide below - and there is a stupid amount of information there. * Take progress pictures. I can't tell you how many times I got discouraged on my journey. It's incredibly hard to see the progress on yourself, especially when you're sad and down on yourself. Progress pictures helped me an immense amount. **They let me see what my mind wouldn't allow me to see.** * Don't give up. Don't feel let down. Everyone fucks up. Everyone makes mistakes. I can't count the amount of times I had a cheat day or a cheat meal. The important thing is getting right back on the right track, and sticking to it. I try to stay away from cheat days entirely now.. And give myself small cheat meals every now and then to maintain my sanity lol. As a huge foodie, and someone who LOVES to bake.. It's hard.. But - It's life :P * **This is by far the most important tip I can give to anyone. This is not a diet. This is not a quick fix. This is a lifestyle change.** If you think of it in any other way, you will gain it all back just like I did. I will never make that mistake again. Imagine how fucking sexy I would be if I kept going for the last 3 years! Lol - ah well. You live, you learn, you grow. I lost about 40-50 pounds in the first 4-5 months simply by conscious and healthy food related decisions. I did absolutely no cardio or working out **Workout ""regiment""** In January, I started at the gym. I did basic cardio (20 minutes on elliptical/bike here a few times a week) and a basic weight lifting split with machines as I had no idea what I was doing. In March, I got serious. I looked into weight lifting and focused on compound movements. I did the StrongLift program for 8 weeks. **Workout A** - Squats, Barbell Rows, Bench Press. **Workout B** - Squats, Overhead Press and Deadlift on another day. 3 times a week alternating ABA, BAB. I started literally with the minimum weights as I have never lifted before. I used the StrongLift's program. I recommend StrongLifts or Starting Strength for anyone and everyone who want's to start building a base of muscle. I can't put into words how amazing it makes me feel. I am now on Week 2 - Day 11 of [Kris Gethin's Trainer](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/kris-gethin-12-week-daily-trainer-intro.html). It is ridiculously intense and I love it. Can't wait to finish all 12 weeks. It's been a goal of mine for a while. I figure this is long enough of a post. If I forgot any key information, please let me know and I will edit it in. I am at work and shouldn't do this but the post that was made about me got deleted yesterday, and I really want to share my story and hopefully motivate/inspire some people. Even 1 person, and I am happy. I will check back on this thread very frequently. I would like to reiterate again, how I never would have started this journey, or been successful without loseit and myfitnesspal. It's a fucking deadly combo. Now, let's get sexy together~ Anyone - please feel free to comment with questions or pm me. I am happy to help everyone and anyone. Thank you loseit, I love you. Daniel Again, sorry about the wall of text. **EDIT** - Can't believe I forgot. My new friend Jack -www.reddit.com/u/thehealthygamer is a huge reason for my recent success. He is a guy I met on reddit, has his own website dedicated to helping gamers get in shape - www.thehealthygamer.com. This is loaded with incredible, free information.

I read this was a good way to put on weight taking one before weight but its a lot of calories and protein this may be causing me more harm. But for the amount of exercise I do I think its justified. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. **EDIT** Height: 6'0 Weight: 165lbs/75kg",

1518,"[Request] How do I evenly distribute external weight when using this gymnastics equipment that cuts my body weight in half (ring trainer/dream machine)?So there's this piece of gymnastics equipment that's called the [ring thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0PN16IOKaE). It goes by other names like the ring trainer or dream machine. It's made of two pulleys, ropes, harness, and rings which the gymnast claims to cut your body weight in half. It's essentially a [pull up/dip machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CI0AJMrnq0) you see in commercial gym on *[steroids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNKVKYlvKAg)*. Here are some skills I'd like to learn using the ring thing: * [Zanetti (F)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPa7NZlHEV0) * [Zahran (F)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krC0DokzAuI) * [Carmona (F)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEmZ3yHOnNU) * [Balandin 2 (E)](http://youtu.be/zNqNDhap-QQ?t=4m2s) * [Van Gelder (E)](http://youtu.be/--U_mgXrYbY?t=4m6s) Since the ring thing cuts my weight in half, I need to add extra weight such as a weighted vest or ankle weights. I weigh 123 lbs. Now my question is, approximately how much weight should be distributed on the torso, thighs, calves, and ankles when I'm working on horizontal skills such as the [planche](http://content.clickbooq.com/86/photos/bf8d7f062c.jpg) and [Maltese](http://www.rio2016.com/sites/default/files/users/Jo%C3%A3o%20Henrique%20Ferreira%20do%20Amaral/183163843.jpg) to maintain the same center of mass? This is crucial for learning the Van Gelder and Zanetti. I know that for a [butterfly to cross](http://www.allthingsgym.com/butterfly-pulls-iron-cross-rings/) and [cross pulls](http://instagram.com/p/mn3HqfmDzP/?modal=true) the weight distribution is not important since it is a vertical movement/skill.",

I've been told so many different things, I'm really not sure what direction to take. I'll start off with some stats: **Height:** 6ft **Weight:** 75kg [My Body](https://imgur.com/a/R7yAFvE) I guess I come under the ""skinny fat"" category, I have a high body fat % and barely any muscle. I know quite a few guys that are the same weight as me, but have clearly defined abs, biceps, triceps etc. I've started eating 4000 calories a day, hitting the gym 6x a week (Reddit PPL) and more recently introducing some ab work/cardio. My concern is that if I bulk I'm just going to put on more fat (that's how it feels anyway, maybe I'm wrong?). Another concern is that if I cut, I'm just going to get considerably weaker (I can barely lift weight as it is!). I'm motivated and ready to be consistent, I just need some expert advice on the direction I need to take. Looking forward to hearing your responses! EDIT: Thanks for all the replies, got a much better idea of what I need to be doing now.

Sometimes this may be true for some people but not true for everyone. It’s an overgeneralization. The circumstances you’re born into greatly influences how your life will turn out. If you’re born into a good or bad country, good or bad family, good or bad genes and etc. For example if you were born in a poor African country with little opportunity, war, corrupt leaders and diseases your quality of life will likely not be good and there would be little you could do about it because a lot of poor countries don’t have much freedom and opportunity to change your circumstances. Not everyone is lucky enough to be born with the opportunity to change their circumstances. I’m sorry but reality does not work this way. If you’re born in a country with low social mobility.

1638,"Does your life suck and you wonder why you want to do cryonics?My life kind of sucks for the most part. I am one of the many lonely single people out there which I heard is very common these days. That being said sometimes i wonder why I even want to do cryonics. I guess I am just simply drawn to it and have been since I was in in college when I first stated researching it 20 years ago. I am wondering if any of you out there think life kind of sucks and if you wonder why you would even want to come back into the world at a future date? Especially when all your family is gone. My hope now in doing cryonics is that if I am brought back in the future I can reprogram my brain in ways that will make me happier. Kind of like those times when I was most happy in my life. I guess if they have the technology to bring you back then they will have the technology to hep reprogram your brain in ways that make you happy. I really don't know where I'm going with this I am just wondering if any of you question if you really want to live longer? Do you ever have depression and think that maybe it is best just to die? There is something that draws me into Cryonics that I'm going to go through with it what ever happens. I really don't understand why I have this drive in me to do Cryonics, it is almost like I was genetically programmed to go through with it.",

Looking for the opposite of a ""my life sucks after having a kid"" tale.Off the top, I'm personally a believer that you make your own happiness, no one can make you happy. Not a kid. Not a spouse. Your happiness is your responsibility. So my SO and I are on opposite ends of a fence on parenting, one of us wanting kids and the other not. I see tales here of rants on childfree, here, and parenting, of how having a kid, despite the love for it, made their life miserable. They complain about how hard it is. How much it costs. Their whole life is about this kid and keeping it alive. The one of us who is for having kids is growing increasingly unhappy about the others position on this topic and the relationship. Perhaps it's time to move on after 6 years, yet we love each other dearly so it's not that easy. So, do any parents have a tale of being unhappy, finding that right co-parent, and being happier with kids. Did you go from something's missing to ""this is what we were missing?"" Was the child all you dreamed it would be? Were the messy diapers, tantrums, money invested, and lost sleep worth the joy a 7 lbs bundle of human brought into your home? Tl;dr - did having a kid bring you happiness?",

1680,"Life sucks and then you die...I am 33 years old. I was orphaned when I was 7 after my father was driving my family home from a trip to camp in Yosemite, fell asleep at the wheel and slammed out suburban into a pilon under a freeway overpass on the drive home. My mom, dad, and 2 sister's died. My 3rd sister Laurie was 4 at the time and thankfully was strapped into a booster seat next to me in the 3rd row of seats. I still remember waking up because of my mom screaming at my dad and grabbing the wheel, started to look up and BOOM! After 4 months in the hospital, with no one familywise to take custody of me, I became a ward of the California state foster care system 2 days before my 8th birthday...my sister and i went to a temporary placement together, but 6 months later she got a permanent adoption offer and I got moved to a kind of elementary School group home. Since the 8th of February 1994 I spent 6 years in foster care getting angry and acting out. At 14 I ran away for good because I had a sadist for a foster dad and a psychotic ""mom"" that collected children like they were baseball cards. After only 6 months on my own, I was arrested for the first time and spent 38 months in CYA for a crime that didn't go as planned. I was released to a halfway house after I completed my GED program in YA early. I spent the next 5 months there and upon turning 18, my record was expunged of the 2 felony convictions I had as a juvenile and I joined the Marine corps in compliance with an agreement I made as part of my plea agreement and a condition of my subsequent early release. I spent just over 6 years in the corps during which I served as an infantryman during my first deployment and after earning my spot amongst the silent corps or invisible corps, AKA force recon. At this point in my life I remember feeling truly proud to be me for the first time I could ever remember. I re-upped after 4 years and 2 tours and immediately deployed for a 3rd time. I was on my way to a successful and lifelong career as a marine when life intervened. In April of 2011, I returned from providing overwatch for a unit of door kickers along with my spotter and our CO and his triggerman. We were maybe 30 feet inside the gate of the inner security fence of our FOB (forward operating base) when a group of MP's showed up with the one star who was CO of the place and we were arrested for violating the ROE (rules of engagement), which had just been changed by order of Pres. Obama just 19 days earlier, and told that we were being charged with several counts each of unlawful extrajudicial killings of recognized enemies, dereliction of duty, and conspiracy to to traffic weapons of war across international borders for the purposes of carrying out the previously mentioned killings. All 4 us, along with 12 more Marines from different units, ended up being convicted of dereliction of duty, weapons trafficking, unlawful invasion of a foreign country, and failure to conform to the orders of the chain of command. It's too long if a story and I don't want to give details that could ID me, but basically we operated in the region where the Afghani mountains straddle the border with Pakistan and we had unwittingly killed several members of a militant group that had managed to drag their asses about 100 yards into Pakistani territory after ambushing several units involved in an op meant to force them to flea the remote tribal region that was their last stronghold at the time. The good times were over and I spent the next 5 years fighting my case on appeals from Leavenworth, got a hearing, fought and prepped for another 5 years through hearings andq motions before finally being set free after *most* of my charges were vacated and being sentenced to time served on two remaining reduced felony crimes. I walked out of prison a little over 3 yrs ago and just today my past convictions on the reduced felonies were finally vacated and my name was cleared. Since I regained my physical freedom I have had next to no luck finding work because not only do employers find out that I am a felon when they run a background check on me, but they also find that I was dishonorably discharged and on top of that, I have spent nearly my entire life since I was 7 being institutionalized in one way or another so my social skills don't do me any favors. I am due to graduate from UC Berkeley after this semester because a non profit that works specifically for soldiers wrongfully imprisoned and undeserving of being dishonorably discharged gave me a scholarship to go to college after joining my case 2 years before I got that first hearing on appeal and they have championed me ever since. Just 2 months ago I spoke with my little sister for the first time in 24 or 25 years. Despite all of the positives lately, I can't help this constant feeling I have that the rug is about to be yanked from beneath my feet any second and I seem to be in a constant limbo of uncertainty unable to vote, bear arms for the country that I fought for, or even get a fast food job because of a dishonorable discharge. I am a Marine today and I always have been since the day I completed basic. Once a Marine always a Marine, you know? On the other hand I am an institutionalized, manic depressive with PTSD and paranoid personality disorder. It has been a long battle, but I couldn't help thinking about all this after finally regaining my good name to the best extent I am likely to ever regain it. There is another quote Marines live and die by: ""Death Before Dishonor."" Knowing that my future likely holds more of the same in store and that I just scraped together all the honor a dishonorably discharged, mentally unstable, and institutionalized Marine is likely to find I sometimes wonder if it would be better if I hold on to what's left of my honor and get busy dying before my dignity is taken from me as well. Looking forward to graduation at CAL though, maybe I will get one more moment of pride. I'm not sure why I wrote this treatise, but I thought the other felons and black sheep reading this would at least understand these thoughts and I needed someone to tell. Like I said, life sucks and then you die...or so I'm told anyways. Thanks for reading my be and keep your heads up while you still can.",

I have to begin by explain the music program at this school. Ever seen the movie Whiplash? Kinda like that, but profs don’t do anything illegal when you fuck up. Instead of the regular course load first year music students are forced to take 8 full courses a semester. Basically it’s a metric fuck load of work. Last semester I made the grave mistake that I promised myself I wouldn’t do, I got a girlfriend. Right after midterms slowed down I thought it would be wise to take this wonderful girl out on a date. She liked me, I liked her, we started dating. Two and a half months of a great relationship go by and about two weeks ago semester one starts. Now shit really hits the fan, I begin to notice extremely early on into the semester that my girlfriend is expected me to spend more and more time with her, that which I can’t blame her for, but I need to study and practice otherwise I may fail midterms this semester. And I can’t have that. As of yesterday I came to the conclusion that the only way I was gonna get my time back is if I left her. It was difficult but I broke up with her because of this cursed Music Program that demands everything from you.

1706,"How much louder do I need to scream for help? [Vent][TW: Suicide, Depression] I didn't want to put it in the title, I didn't want to say it, I am ashamed it came to this, I am angry that it came to this, and I'm sorry it came to this. Suicide We've all thought about it, some more than others, some seriously and some not, but I believe there comes a time when we all consider suicide, maybe we don't feel worthy of living, or maybe everything is lost, and it's game over. We all try to make the best out of our situation, we see posts here about families cutting ties, stopping college funding, and kicking them out to the street, but we all have this feeling of happiness that at least *my* family didn't react like that. Well mine did, and I was just testing waters. It's been a hard summer for me, I'm worried about everything, I don't know if my scores are good enough for the colleges I want to go to, I feel a new wave of sadness every time I think of going back to my Christian school for my Senior year, and I feel even worse because this is year three for me in hiding. I use to think I would be happy to be this far, so close to getting to an open-minded place where people understand me, but now I realize that once I go to college in a year, I am still in the same hellhole that is my life, just in a different location. I was talking with my parents this evening, I use a joke tactic to judge acceptance, which is great in the short run, but for my to convince them in the future will be harder, but tonight I wasn't joking, I was done, I was having trouble holding myself together, I slipped. There was a local magazine on the coffee table, a very pretty woman was on the front, her outfit was adorable, jean shorts and a flouncy top. I used my standard, *what if I came home looking like this?* on my parents, my mom is used to it, she *knows* I am kidding, my Dad just tells me what *will* happen, and I wasn't ready for it. I am getting disowned. I will be kicked out. My college fund will be gone, put into a new RV most likely. The car that they bought me will be sold. I am not loved unconditionally, and if the love is conditional, is it even worthy of being love? I got a call while sitting at this desk, my dad asked if I *wanted* a new car, I swear to the Flying Spaghetti Monster I said no. They told me that my car was having problems, I don't have any experience with vehicles so I trusted them, I got a 2014 model, 14 miles on it. I interviewed an auto shop owner for my business class, he asked why I had a new car, I told him the other was having some problems, he asked how many miles were on it, it had a powertrain warranty on all the problems that I was told it had, and that's how I learned that I had been trapped by my parents. So here we are, a week before I start my Senior year, the *best* year of my life, and I want to be done. I was told that by my mom that I am not unconditionally loved, and my Dad didn't even have to say it, all because I don't feel like a human being as a man. My mom and I talked after my Dad went to bed, she said I should stop kidding because there are people who do feel that way, and in my head I am like *well no fucking shit, I'm standing right in front of you*, but she quickly followed up about how I don't feel like that. I said goodnight and told her I stopped kidding long ago. Which she most likely took as one last jab. How obvious do I have to be, I am a shell of a human being, and if I could cry I would be right now. I don't want to live anymore, I don't care about the promise I made myself, things changed, life happened, and I got the short end of the stick. A fucking defect of the brain, *a mistake*. I go to get my haircut today (2 am), and I will lose the only thing that I like about myself, my fucking 2009 Justin Bieber hair. I have no one to turn to, no one to love, no one to return the favor, no one to cry with, and nothing to live for. There is one last thing I want to do though, and that's to see the movie version of If I Stay. That gives me about a week and a half to chicken out, but unlike the last time I was invited by the trees, I hope I won't this time. I fucking hope I get to see Satan, because I want to shake his hand and wish him a happy eternity as I give the middle finger to whatever power, that I doubt exists, that put me through this. Thanks for listening to the voice inside your head that read this to you. I am going to try to sleep. I apologize for whatever grammar errors there are, my first language is English, and it's really fucking complicated sometimes.",

1708,"What we found 1000 metres below the sea makes me not want to live anymore.About three years ago I was a science reporter on board the North Atlantic research vessel, Baseline Explorer. We were roughly twenty km off the coast of Bermuda at the time, and I was getting set to go down in a two-man submersible, something I’d wanted to do since I was a kid. The pilot of the sub was a deep sea veteran called Percy, great guy, great sense of humour; spoke with a thick Texan drawl that made even dumb things sound folksy and wise. First words he said to me were: ‘you ever been down in one of these?’ ‘Never.’ I was grinning, excited as a schoolboy. I was practically shaking. ‘You’ll never forget it,’ he assured me. In hindsight that was some genius-level foreshadowing if ever I heard it. These submersibles weigh in at about eight tonnes, rigged with state-of-the-art scientific equipment, massive search beams mounted just forward of the acrylic bubble, they’re ultra-manoeuvrable even at extreme depths, you can spin them three sixty degrees on a dime, and they have this massive hydraulic arm that the pilot controls with a joystick, I saw Percy move that arm so skilfully I swear to God he could have plucked the pacifier out of a baby’s mouth without even waking it. When he wasn’t piloting the sub Percy liked to play computer games back in the ship’s rec room. I’ve played untold levels of Call of Duty with him and take it from an old-school gamer like me, this guy is crazy good, and what’s even crazier, he’s fifty-eight years old with six grandchildren. Percy was a great guy. But after that voyage, my first, *his* hundred and third, he was never that same guy again. None of us were ever the same again. * The submersibles are miracles of engineering, they can withstand up to twenty-five EAs (Earth Atmospheres), which basically means twenty-five times the pressure at surface level. That’s the equivalent of an ant moving around with twelve jumbo jets parked right on top of it. I’ll never forget the sensation the first time I slipped down through the bubble’s hatch. I was scared. I knew what to expect but I didn’t expect the bubble to be so small, it felt claustrophobic, like climbing down into a tumble dryer, but it actually wasn’t so bad once I was seated. We had a panoramic view of the world through the wrap-around glass, better than IMAX, but as the ship’s crane lowered us into the water I couldn’t help wondering whether this was the last time I’d ever see the sunlight. I was nervous about the journey ahead. My publishers wanted a video essay of a deep sea dive in one of the subs, which made sense seeing as my job was to report on all the functions of a scientific research vessel, but we were going down close to the sub’s limits, almost a thousand metres, and suddenly the whole thing was very daunting. But Percy quickly put me at my ease, he’d been down over a hundred times, and in his opinion it was safer than driving to the neighbourhood liquor store. * As the sub descended into the depths it felt like we were motionless for long periods of time, like we were just hanging there in an eternity of blue-tinted space, but Percy assured me we were still descending, still going down, the water becoming bluer, darker, the deeper we went. There was a second submersible trailing us like a ghost. The pilot was an Israeli guy called Avi. He was a stoic son-of-a-bitch. I’d been on board the Baseline Explorer three weeks and I’d never seen him crack so much as a smile. He was nicknamed The Machine. The name fit him like a glove. He flashed his searchlights at us at the beginning of the trip when we were hovering close to the surface, and sometimes Percy would talk to him over the radio as we made our way down, but it was all professional chitchat, The Machine wasn’t the kind of person who inspired small talk. As co-pilot of the sub it was pretty much my job to keep the glass clear of condensation, so every few minutes I’d give the inside of the acrylic bubble a wipe-over, the rest of the time I was filming and commentating on whatever I was seeing around me. Around 200 metres down we started moving from the epipelagic zone (the sunlight zone) to the twilight or “mesopelagic” zone, and now the ocean turned this deep aquamarine, like the sky just before dawn, we see a moray eel slithering through the cone of our search lights, a school of grouper fish flittering around us like silver confetti, and The Machine calls our attention to a couple of small tiger sharks that follow us for a while and then peel off into the darkness. We’re almost a thousand metres underwater and its pitch black. We’re in the midnight zone. Not a single photon of light is able to get down this far. The only source of illumination is our searchlights. We’re just fixing to start heading back when suddenly Percy kills all momentum. We’re just hanging there. “What’s wrong?” Percy looked stone-faced, his skin had drained of all colour and his lips were trembling, like he was muttering something under his breath, and he had this fixed expression on his face, this intensity to his gaze that warned me something was off. ‘Percy…?’ Percy reached out and snapped the searchlights off. ‘There’s something out there,’ he whispered. I don’t know how to describe the impact those words had on me, you can report the things a man says, but it is hard to convey the *way* he says them, and the way Percy said, “there’s something out there,” sent an instant chill down my spine. He sounded scared. Only the sound of our breathing now as we both stared out into the pitch blackness. There *was* something out there. I couldn’t see it, but I could sense it, something was watching us, and I’ve never felt anything like that before, I was an atheist at the time but afterwards I would describe it as a religious experience. I have no idea what I meant by that. I was in shock at the time. I don’t know what the fuck I was saying. ‘What is it?’ I barely recognised the sound of my own voice, it sounded thin and childlike, like suddenly, in a heartbeat, I had regressed to infancy. I gripped Percy’s arm. ‘What’s out there?’ I turned to him. He looked like death. He looked more scared than I have ever seen a man, computer lights patterning his features, shadows scavenging his flesh, his eyes yellow and glazed with terror. What the hell would scare a man like Percy? He was hard as nails, an adrenaline junky by all accounts, but right then he looked like he was walking the green mile. I turned back and stared out the bubble of the Atlantis. Darkness so deep it seemed to swallow my thoughts. What was out there? Why was I shaking with this incomprehensible dread? It felt like a premonition of doom. The searchlights from the second sub carved past us, The Machine oblivious to what we could so clearly sense, he was manoeuvring his sub sideways, trying to figure out why we had come to a full stop. ‘Turn the lights off,’ Percy whispered in a voice tight with panic, and then suddenly he jerked forward and flicked the radio toggle. ‘Avi, turn your fucking lights off,’ he hissed. But it was too late. The searchlights illuminated something in the darkness below us and to my dying day I wish I’d never seen what I saw next. It’s haunted my dreams ever since. I’ve burned through three marriages and an army of therapists, I’ve attempted suicide three times, and I’m addicted to opioids and booze and I still can’t get that image out of my head. At first I thought I was looking down at some kind of luminous disc of immense size, I’d guess three times the diameter of our sub, so I’d say about twenty feet across, and it was a silvery texture, soft and slightly faceted. There were bands of colour radiating outwards from this circle of absolute black that sat right in the centre of the disc. I can’t describe that black. It was darker than the absence of light, it was the fucking absence of hope; before he put a bullet in his head three years ago Percy called me up: ‘it was like looking into nothing,’ he told me, ‘absolute zero – it tore my fucking mind apart….’ He was sobbing as he spoke. He was in a bad way. His wife had left him. His kids had disowned him. He’d lost his home. His job, his dignity…and finally, he lost the reason to go on living…. Nietzsche once said: “when you look into the abyss, the abyss also looks into you.” That’s what it felt like staring into that black circle. Like it was staring back at me. I saw it for maybe a second before The Machine snapped his searchlights off, but there was an eternity in that second, there was the sensation of falling into the abyss, being swallowed by the darkness, of slowly losing my mind…. It was an eye. That disc with the black circle in the middle had been a fucking eye that measured twenty feet across, and to this day my skin goes cold when I remember it, this colossal eye staring at us out of the dark, and the intensity of that gaze was beyond human comprehension, it was an intelligence measured in aeons, it was an evil beyond scripture, beyond reason, and it laid its immemorial gaze upon us, and we were blighted by it, scarred by it, destroyed by it… God help us…. And then The Machine snapped his searchlights off and the darkness took away that awful vision, but not the memory of it…I felt despair unlike anything I’ve ever experienced, a black terror filled my heart, that eye, Jesus Christ in heaven, how big was the monster that possessed that eye….? It felt Biblical. I didn’t have to look at Percy to know he was feeling the same thing. That eye did not belong to a thing of reason or nature; it was not a thing of science, it was a monster, it was the mother of every nightmare our children wake screaming from. And even as I thought this, Percy whispered: ‘…curse that day, those who are ready to rouse Leviathan….’ And to my ears he sounded like a dead man quoting scripture. I gazed into the darkness ahead, I knew that eye was still staring at us even though I could no longer see it, I felt the crushing weight of its gaze, and I was drunk with the horror of it, making sounds at the back of my throat, attempts to speak but no words came out, I was trapped, I wanted to run and hide but sitting in a tiny submersible one thousand metres below sea level there’s nowhere to run, and nowhere to hide…. The radio crackled, The Machine was saying something but I wasn’t listening, I was still staring into that god awful darkness. Something was moving out there, I could sense it, like a mountain turning its ancient face towards us, and I could feel the dreadful gravity of that monster as it turned, the most horrific images flashing through my head, mass graves filled with bodies not quite dead, a wolf chewing through a leg caught in a hunter’s trap, emaciated children standing behind a chain link fence, refugees caught on barbed wire borders, screaming for help, I was tearing at my hair and beating at my skull, but the images only grew more horrific, and my brain felt like one huge, pulsing blood-clot. I heard Percy howling in pain and terror. I heard my own screams from a million miles away. And then, abruptly, the images were gone. I sucked in a sobbing breath, and turning to Percy I yelled: ‘Get us out of here!’ He shook his head. ‘Look,’ he said. Something had appeared in the darkness ahead. There was some kind of fissure opening up in the inky void, a fiery glow spilling out of it that illuminated the surrounding ocean, and as I watched, the fissure grew wider and wider, until it gaped almost a hundred feet wide, maybe more, and that fiery, larval glow filled my entire forward vision, it was the colour of napalm and post nuclear sunsets, and staring into that yawning chasm I swear to God I saw **hell incarnate**, filled with multitudes of tortured souls. My therapists all said it was a hallucination. But Percy and The Machine both saw the same thing. The fissure opened into a cavern of impossible dimensions, so vast it contained entire mountain ranges, and fiery lakes, and rivers of boiling blood, and molten rain, burning as it fell from thick sulphur yellow clouds, and I saw naked multitudes, thousands upon thousands of screaming souls, being snatched up by enormous winged beasts and cast into these lakes of fire. The winged beasts were horrific looking, some kind of hybrid, they carried pitchforks and branding irons and some of them had the heads of birds and the bodies of men, and others were reptilian monstrosities, but all of them, I sensed, were filled with a black hatred for humanity. Percy was screaming the Lord’s prayer, and I remember my mouth stretched wide, gaping in horror, and tears streaming down my face, and then, that awful fissure slowly closed, and I think it was that moment I realised I had been staring into the mouth of that creature…. I don’t remember how we got back to the surface. I remember they had to handcuff me to a cot in the infirmary once we were back on board the ship, I was screaming, I couldn’t stop, they made me wear diapers, I couldn’t even control my bowels. I was in the infirmary three days, screaming and shitting myself into a stupor. The Machine hung himself a week after returning home. His wife found him. He left a note. A single word in Hebrew. “Leviathan.” I’m trying to put it behind me. It’s been six years and I’m the only one left. The days are getting better, but I dread the coming of night, sinking down into sleep the way we sank down into that abyss, terrified of what awaits me in my dreams. I’ve never been back to the ocean. * [God bless us all.](https://mailchi.mp/b3f876bd3f42/deluna)",

1716,"If cis people are the ones who decide wether my gender identity is actually a mental illness or not, then I don't want to live anymore.I always see the discussions about wether being trans is legit or not, if trans people should be treated like equals, or if people should try to ""cure"" them, since they can't reproduce or whatever. What's the point of living like this? How am I supposed to live a normal life, if I can't even have any agency over myself? I'll have to take hormones for the rest of my life, just to simulate the body that I should have been born with. And even then, I'm a biological outcast. ""Trannies, deluded gays&lesbians, confused teens, mentally ill something something."" And it seems like the general view of those who aren't transphobes is the more or less scientific version of ""idk, let the weirdos be weird."" There's a whole thread where people discuss wether or not being trans is a mental illness, and they dissect it like some sort of asylum study. I feel so dehumanized and worthless. I just wanted to have a nice, and relatively normal live. But now I can't even have a nice and normal body, something that most people don't even have to take into account, ever. Just thinking that like 90% of the population won't ever have to worry about having to adjust their gender, and how they will never be ridiculed or avoided for it makes me want to just kill myself. They get their bodies, they get to be accepted as regular people, not as ""that trans person."" They don't have to fight for that acceptance, at least. They won't be studied and questioned, thrown together with ""amputation dysphoric people"", because **there just has to be something wrong with them**. This isn't worth it. It just isn't. I can't do this. I want to be the kind of person that can exist without having to worry about how my body functions, or how other's perceive it. I don't want to be a minority that people either actively hate, or not give a (scientific) shit about. If anyone here thinks that being trans is just a dumb choice someone makes, then I envy you for being able to live a life that detatched from the issue. But I also think that it's unfair, since so many trans people have to feel worse because of this worldview. &#x200B; Edit: I will leave this post here, but I just want to add that I'm really not all that passionate about my trans issues. I know that it's a part of my life, but I'm more than just my gender identity, and I don't want people to think otherwise because of this post, and / or my comments.",

1728,"Just cried my eyes out to my boyfriend on the phone. I don’t want to live anymoreI don’t wanna have to do it, uni, career, getting old. I’m 21, childhood abuse survivor. I just don’t want to live anymore, there’s no point, I feel like I know that this suffering is always going to be with me all my life one way or another no matter how small. I’ve been to my GP so many times with my mental health issues and they’re offering me no support I’ve been put on waiting list after waiting list, had two assessments and it’s been 7 months now. I have a therapist I’m seeing once a week for 50mins but it’s not enough, gonna try seeing her more. The idea of dying is so tempting to me. I want to be looked after like a child, like I never was. No one can do that for me so I just have to keep doing stuff for myself by myself and it sucks. On certain things I’ve never been taught the “correct” or efficient way to do things and yet my peers and others expect me to be keeping up with others that have. I’m at a massive disadvantage and no one seems to notice, even my boyfriend says I should be more proactive even though I’m being really proactive just by fucking staying alive. How on earth am I supposed to carry on with 19 years of trauma at 21? I’m on ssris but fucking hell. No one but my therapist is like “ you’re doing great” or like “ oh my god that’s such a lot of trauma.” I feel spoilt just asking for other people to do that. It sometimes feels like I’m being unreasonable. But I want to be empathised with and I don’t think that’s too much to ask. Why do I feel invisible and like no one cares? It’s so confusing. Fully wondering whether I just need to break up with him. He’s lovely but not that supportive and here I am knowing I love him and I wouldn’t want to be with someone else but he’s there telling me I need to be more proactive WHEN I’M CRYING. He has high functioning aspergers and I feel like an asshole for expecting more from him but oh my god. I can’t tell if this break up thinking is the suicidal thoughts talking but it’s like I just can’t wait to talk to him on the phone but then I do and it’s often so disappointing because he doesn’t help or criticises me when I’m already down. It’s really affecting me and a reason why I was crying on the phone to him. I don’t want to not be with him I just feel so much pain sometimes, I also worry about him taking that on. He said being supportive is so tiring sometimes and I get that. It’s not unreasonable to want it though is it? I dunno. I need more support so that I don’t kill myself but there doesn’t seem to be much out there. Love to you all Edit: thanks for your support you really helped me. It was just a blip moment and I love my boyfriend so much and I feel we’re stronger now. He took on board what I was saying and my therapist taught me how to communicate and work things out better this week. I never want to break up with him. I reported my parents to the police a few days ago and my therapist thinks the episode above was me processing things. Thanks for your advice. My therapist showed me that he was being really supportive by allowing me to cry and allowing me to vent. I’m so glad she did as he really is supportive and I was able to tell him this finally so that he doesn’t feel bad.",

1739,"Mom doesn't want to live anymoreI'm really lost at the moment.. Yesterday i got a call from my dad. My mom is laying in the hospital since July this year, and before that she got hospitalized in a clinic for mental illnesses. Long story short, she had depressions since her twenties, and the doctors also says she is bipolar. So my whole life i know (I'm 27 now) her like this, ofcourse she has her good times but it always comes back. Last year around this time she got diagnosed with breast cancer, luckily she was in an early stage so she got chemo and her breast got amputated and now everything is under control. But as i said she got hospitalized in a clinic this year because mental wise she was doing horrible. And now she's is the hospital for 5 months.. When she first got there she was in a really bad state, it was like she had dementia, she didn't know where she was, she didn't recognize her family at first and she had these spasms that really terrified me. This lasted for about 3 months, and now slowly you can have a small conversation with her but she's really tired fast. She doesn't remember the last few months, but she is aware of what's going on around her. Well okay, back to what happened yesterday. My dad called, he told me he had bad news. Basically what he was saying is that my mom is done.. She has given up hope that it ever will be okay. She says we can do without her and we don't need her. She wants to die :'( I'm so lost, i don't want to lose my mom.. I don't want her to be in pain and i want her to have peace, but i'm not ready to lose her at this age! I want kids in the future and i want her to be a part of it, i want her to be a grandma and i want her to be there when i get married one day.. She said painful things to my dad, that she never loved him.. We all know she doesn't mean that, she immediately got shocked herself when she said that. I feel like she's pushing us away.. I'm going to see my mom this evening, and of course we're not giving up on her just yet! But I'm really scared that if the times come, and my mom isn't here anymore that more worse things are gonna happen. My sister has also depressions, and she tried to kill herself more than once.. My dad is a drinker and he drinks too much in stressful times.. So I'm really really scared for my whole family.. So sorry for the long post, if only 1 person would read this i would be thankful.

1754,"Apparently mom said she doesn’t want to live anymore in therapy today. Should I have reason to worry?Long story short, sis had a therapy appointment with UBPD mom today. Sis was amazing and didn’t show any emotion, but I guess my mom has an explosive reaction at one point when christmas was brought up (we didn’t spend it with her, and she tried to insist that because she spent it with her boyfriend and our mentally disabled cousin that she learned “what Christmas was all about” but then went on to say how my sisters and I probably “did not have a merry Christmas without her there” 🙄🙄🙄). I guess she started sobbing and screeching, like, went totally nuclear. The therapist had to usher my sister out of the room and as my sister left the room mom said she “just didn’t want to live anymore”. I know. They boy who cried wolf lol My sister and I suspect it was mom’s dramatic way of trying to dig at my sister and get a reaction out of her (who wasn’t phased at all), but you never know with this type of stuff, I guess. Like, I know I’ve probably got nothing to worry about and she probably only said it for attention/to get my sister to feel bad, but it’s still leaving this nagging feeling in the back of my head. I don’t really want her in my life atm, but I don’t want anything to happen to her either. I hate it cause this type of thing is TOTALLY what she wants. That’s why I figured I’d come to y’all for this to give me peace of mind. Should I have something to worry about? And if not, is there something I can do to not worry about it?

1756,"A Friend (18F) of mine (19M) doesnt want to live anymoreI just got a call from a really good friend of mine. Weve known each other for about 3 years, 2 out of which we've been in a relationship and after that we've stayed friends. She told me about a guy shes been dating and apparently he went on a date with another girl. She was really hurt by this, it all looked like they were almost a couple. However thats not the only reason she doesnt want to live anymore. Shes had a lot of negative feelings building up for a while. From her alcoholic father, her only slightly less bad stepfather to her bad experiences with some boys and the list definitely goes on. So she told me she is tired of living and basically already accepted that she is going to die sooner than other people. She didnt say it but suicide is not out of the question for her. The problem I have is: A lot of the things she said are things I cant really give an uplifting response to because I've had the same thoughts and still have. I feel like I cant help her because if I could i could help myself as well. If anyone's been in a similar situation I would really appreciate if youd share your thoughts on this. Shes really important to me and I dont know what to say to her other than how much she matters to me.

I looked like a man wearing women’s clothes. I look more feminine in my boys clothes then I did in the outfits I tried on. Shopping was supposed to piss off my parents and show them that I could look like a girl if I tried. I left empty handed. My dad said that no matter how many surgeries I get and how much hormones I take, I’m still a man and that’s all anyone will see. And now those words are engraved into my head and this shopping trip just proves he’s right. When I came out, I told him that if I had to live in a world where I see myself as a man and everyone sees me as a man, then I’d kill myself. He said that a very superficial way of thinking of things, and I’m starting to think he’s right. I mean, I’d hurt myself because I hate how I look that much, and that’s just like not associating with someone because they’re ugly or fat or whatever. Right?

1784,"I don't want to live anymoreI'm not sure if this is the right place for this but it needs to be said. I just don't want to live anymore. Not for any reason in particular either, I'm just sick of getting of getting up in the morning and living each day. I wish I could just clock out and leave, but I just keep waking up. I had a blood test recently and hoped they would find something, anything, as long as it was terminal. That feels disgusting and selfish to type but that is legitimately how I feel. I don't know if I'm depressed or what but I've been ""switched off"" for a while, and I don't really feel anything anymore. I don't think I have it in my to commit suicide, or a means that would be instantaneous and painless. I'd say I had a pretty good upbringing, I didn't grow up poor or miserable really. The one thing I didn't have was supportive parents and that sucked the life out of whatever dreams or aspirations I might have had at the time, but they cared in their own ways. I'm just so sick and tired of living at this point, and knowing I've got to keep doing it for another 60 odd years really just makes me feel worse. I understand this isn't normal, but I'm not sure I want to be cured Edit: to clarify a few things, I'm not a teenager. I understand that typically this train of though is usually attributed to teens but I've already been through my teenage bout of depression and came out better for it. But this is different. I feel a bit empty I guess. Its strange to try and put into words and pinpoint exactly what this is but I'm just done. I'm just so tired",

1789,"I don't feel qualified to live anymoreI suppose before I say what I want to I should start off with a little bit of context. I'm a 20 year old straight cis brown male who at this rate has less romantic and sexual experience than a fetus. And that's all the context you really need, my story isn't that different from anyone else's here and your all smart people. Now I understand that it's pretty popular to see having children as nothing more than a burden on the already overpopulated planet and they will destroy everything that makes life enjoyable for you but I always wanted to to find a nice partner, become finically stable and eventually start a family. But, about three months ago me and my friend were walking to my house to hang out at around midnight. But a couple kids snuck up behind us assaulted us. I ended up getting beat up and mugged, I had lost my phone and my laptop. I think it only lasted about two minutes but it defiantly felt like it lasted longer, like ten minutes, and not just any ten minutes, it was one of those ten minutes where you stare at the clock and all of a sudden those ten minutes feel like ten hours. Eventually they ran away and I got off the ground. My friend was no where to be seen, I had assumed he had managed to escape, I was never angry at him it seemed like the logical thing to do, but I had no way of contacting him. I had a pretty big bruise on my jaw, it made it hard to eat and talk for about a week. I told a small handful of people about what happened and for two days I became extremely paranoid and afraid to step out of my house and even when I did, I realized I constantly looked over my shoulder and carried a pocket knife which I still do to this day. About half a week later I finally ran into my friend once more, he had no injuries and he hadn't lost anything and he told me that he elbowed one of our assailants and ran, they barley even chased him. He also told me that he had circled back to place where the incident had happened to check on me which I believed and appreciated. But not to long a thought came to me, I believe that I am unqualified to live. Now this next part will include an analogy, I know for a fact that dinosaurs and cave people didn't live together, I'm just trying to emphasize a point. I realized that I didn't have any fight or flight response, I froze. Back in the day that would have meant you died. Back in the day when a t rex charged at cave people their fight or flight reaction would kick in and some of them would grab their spears to fight and others would run away. Both of those groups had at least some chance of survival but the ones that froze defiantly died. Evolution and natural selection rooted out those that froze and I froze. Now I understand that these high octane stressful situations are rare but they can happen and everyone wants a partner that can make them feel safe. Like if a fire broke out in their house they probably want a partner that can grab a fire extinguisher and put out a fire or at least run to their phone and call the fire department, not one that freezes in place and does nothing. Now please understand that I am not suicidal, I'm probably not gonna kill myself, I just think I don't have the right to live. I just don't think I have the right to a partner or a family. I don't even know why I typed this out, I just needed a little release",

1798,"It's been almost a year and a half with no job. Being rejected and mostly ghosted. Every. Single. Time! I just don't want to live ANYMORE!!! (Considering taking my life in days time)I am beginning to believe that I chose the wrong career choice for my future. And I wanna END IT ALL IN A FEW DAYS. I am a 3D/CGI/VFX artist who graduated in November 2018 currently based and live in New Zealand. I studied this field because I loved it since I was a kid and I thought to make a career out of this. As someone who is SE Asian and grew up in an SE Asian household, my parents were very critical about my career choice but they did not want to force me because it takes away a persons freedom if they do that but does not change the fact that they were still critical. I wanted to prove them wrong by doing this and working super hard on it with many fails and successes. Keep in mind my parents are the loveliest people you can meet and they are the greatest and toughest people I have ever known. The dumb and crazy shit I and my other siblings put them through for so many years and they still love us unconditionally no matter what. I aim to be that great of a person and parent one day. Now I'm starting to think they're right. This field is very limited. I don't know how the fuck my peers got jobs in the industry from almost immediately or within 6 months. Most VFX studios want experienced people in their recruitment. I think it is my fault to because I did not take any internship programs during school breaks. I didn't because my skills were still lacking and I was working hard to improve on it in the break times. I had positive thinking back then that I would improve my work so I won't screw up or slow anything down. After graduating My plan was if I don't get in to a job in the industry, I will just work odd jobs or any job not related to my qualifications. So I started applying to studios and other companies not related to my field. Reality hit me there, I have more ghosts than rejection replies. Maybe because I don't have enough work experience? is that it? even though their job listings were okay with no experience? I had my first real job when I was 20 years old (to some people a bit late for my age) it was simple warehouse job picking and packing mobile phone accessories. I was a casual there. I was there for I think a month and then I had to do ""Jury Duty"". Okay side note: FUCK JURY DUTY/SERVICES!!! IT IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!! Because of this stupid bullshit that I lost my job and they never called me back after that! What's worse is I endured this shit and the trials never happened so I waited for 4 hours in the waiting lobby with other like minded who clearly don't want to be there. We did this for 2 days and they let us go on the 2nd day because the trials were cancelled. After that I never got a call from my first job. Who ever sent me that Jury summon letter, FUCK YOU TO OBLIVION I got lucky my 2nd job was I got contacted by a local studio through my Linkedin that they need someone to help with a hero character in a commercial. MY face and night lit up when I first got this message and didn't' hesitate to accept it. Even my parents were happy about this even though it just freelance work.. About a month after I applied for more since my work ended. And no surprise more ghosting, and uncertain projects starting from other studios who kind of considered me. OH maybe I will go back to the other plan find other jobs. And then ghosting and rejections from that too. The shame that I am feeling right now is so great. I am almost a 25 yr old guy and I never even had a real job or done anything impactful in my life. Seeing younger peers even the ones born in the new millennium area happy they have jobs and other activities. I feel embarrassed when we have family gatherings and they all talking about their days and everything. What did I achieve... I graduated, got my degree. Had a month long job. I'm still in my learner driver license since 2014? That's it? FUCK ME DEAD I don't wanna exist! Erased! Whats worse is we can't afford our house anymore because of my unemployment. To add insult to injury my family is almost falling apart and I am afraid I am afraid I am responsible for half of this mess the other half is the stupid decision the fiance and my older sibling that caused a further crack to our family. I love my parents, younger sibling and older sibling and any other relative who loved me to death I would take a bullet for any of them and I would kill anyone if they tried to cause any violence, harm to them. They are the ones who are keeping me from ending myself. If I did not have anyone I would've ended it long ago. I wanna end it all if the insult to injury happens. Then again I have thoughts about how selfish it is for me to end myself and how selfish the act is as well.I would just create a whole other problem or bigger. I would cause sadness, pain and despair to a large amount of people. I am still considering ending it in a few days. I still have time. I may not be here anymore to some of you who will read this and reply. Oh you know what I wish it was a reality where you can actually donate your own life to someone who actually wants to live. Someone who are dying from battle damage, sickly, cancer patients, babies who were aborted just anyone who wants to live. God bless to each and everyone one of them.",
1799,"I don’t want to live anymoreIt’s only Jan 20th and it’s been the worst year of my life thus far. After holding onto my heart for years, I finally started to trust and love. But he he cheated on me with his ex wife. I lost a best friend towards the end of last year. And now I just found out my ex-husband is engaged to someone else. We have only been divorced a year. I don’t even have anyone to tell because my best friend is gone! I have absolutely nothing going for me. Nothing at all. I give and give and give but I must be a shitty, shitty person for this to keep happening to me. I can’t do this anymore.",
1800,"[30 year old MtF] Looking for a mentor! Feeling isolated, alone, and hopeless :(Given my age (30) and amount of time on hormones (20 months), I suppose one would expect that I would be closer to being a mentor instead of needing one. Unfortunately that isn't the case. At a support group I went to recently, almost everyone there had been on hormones for less time than me. And they all looked so much better than me too. The hope I regained the first day I took hormones has been fading. I've never male failed or come close to it, my friends and family have essentially disappeared. My wife has been my only supporter, but she is struggling with the transition too. My guilt toward her is, I feel, stunting my motivation, and her struggles to accept me has in turn limited her support. It's a catch 22 where I need to advance for her to become comfortable, but I can't seem to do that on my own. I'm on my 4th job in less than a year. All my friendships have dissolved. I'm misgendered and dead named by EVERYONE. My family has apathetically disappeared. My depression has overly complicated my treatments and I've been on 10 different anti-depressents in 10 years. I feel my soul dying... I feel like I'm losing the ability to feel, love, and experience joy. 18 months of hormones have only made me look like a younger pretty boy. My confidence has been shattered by the worst 2 years of my life. And I can't, by myself, bring myself back up. I really, badly need a mentor/supporter... The only transwoman I've had coffee with, who I had intended on being a good relationship for me, ghosted me without any reason whatsoever. The support groups I've been to have isolated me more than how I felt going in. I can't find a good therapist to connect with. I'm just wading through life. I am called Andy now. I want 2019 to be ""the year of Alyssa!"" but I need help so badly! If anyone out there is willing to lend any support whatsoever, I think it could be a benefit to me. And I'll try my best to make it a two way street and offer my own support and love! This is mostly a shot in the dark, but hopefully it connects with someone. Thank you so much, and keep doing what you're doing mentors. You change lives, and I hope to do so myself someday (when I get a little stronger myself!) &#x200B; Sincerely, Alyssa",
1801,"Is it normal to have a recurring vision every time I get high?Hello, I’m not sure if this is the place to ask, but I’m curious as to why I might be having these recurring thoughts and what they might mean. I’ve been smoking weed since I was a junior in high school. I’m a freshman in college now, so it hasn’t been very long. I don’t do it frequently, but I’d say I maybe smoke and/or consume an edible like once or twice a month? Originally I would smoke with the intention of just having a good time with my friends. Now I smoke to try to understand why I have this recurring thought in my head. I see this thing... an entity if you will. I understand that weed is a hallucinogen, and it allows the mind to do wonders. But for me, it allows my mind to see a creature that, for some reason, is significant enough for my mind to keep imagining this. I didn’t start seeing it until about 6 months after I had first smoked. And just to clarify, I only see this when I’m stoned. The first time I saw it, I was obviously confused but more intrigued. It takes the form of a hexagon. It’s two-dimensional, and has a face. It has small, beady eyes, a big round nose, and a little slit for its mouth. It has lots of arms and legs, and it wears this magnificent headpiece that is hard to put into words. So basically, I drew this thing on a piece of paper to try and help my sober self remember. At first, it was confusing and honestly hilarious. I figured it was just some random thing I drew in the midst of everything (as I always draw when I’m high). But then I got high again. I saw it. It was sitting there, mocking me out of the corner of my eye. It doesn’t speak, nor does it move. It’s just... there. I understand this is probably just a figment of my imagination, but my high self seems to think it’s something significant. Fast-forward to maybe my sixth time getting high, since encountering this being. I was with some friends, and asked for a pencil and paper. I was drawing it everywhere. My friends asked me what I was doing, and I told them I was summoning the Waffle Man. I’m not sure why it came out that way, as he doesn’t even look anything like a waffle. But I’ve called it that ever since. That was maybe a little over a year ago. Since then I’ve probably gotten high over a dozen times, each time seeing the same thing. It’s gotten to the point where that’s all I see. I don’t want to say it’s not fun getting high anymore, because it most definitely is. It’s just, different now and I’m not sure what to do. With each time I get high, I feel as though I’m getting closer and closer to discovering what this means, but I can’t seem to figure it out. It’s like a dream that never ends. I want it to end, but I don’t want to permanently cut weed out of my life. It’s a wonderful tool I use for my artwork. I’m an artist, and I enjoy painting and drawing. When I’m high, I feel as though it opens my mind up to a whole new world of possibilities. It’s a completely different dimension. That’s why it’s hard to wrap my head around. I can’t seem to figure out how to connect this thing to my regular thoughts. It doesn’t make any logical sense. I know it’s probably just a figment of my imagination, but it’s something of significance. Each time I get high, it seems as though I’m getting closer and closer to figuring out what this is, and what it means. Or even if it means anything at all. The brain is super complex, so I wouldn’t be surprised if this were just some completely random thing my brain conjured up. But both my high self and sober self can’t stop thinking about it. I mean when I’m high, that’s the only thing I can think about. I don’t really want to think about it anymore. It was ok the first couple of times, but now it’s becoming kind of concerning. Is this something I can forget? Or is there any way I can stop thinking about this when I’m high? I don’t want to have to put up with this anymore, I’m getting really sick of seeing hexagons and dying inside a little bit. Otherwise, if I’m unable to erase this from my thoughts, how can I go about trying to find the “meaning” of this thing’s existence? Will I ever be able to know? Or am I stuck living with this for the rest of my life? I know this is probably really confusing, because I’m just as confused myself. But I don’t know what to do about this thing always on my mind.",
1803,"I'm depressed and I'm dying inside..First off Salam. I have been depressed for 3 years or so now. Before depression I did do good deeds but I forgot about Allah. I forgot to pray salah, fast etc (teenage years). 2 years into depression I found Islam again. I started praying, fasting and being merciful to everyone I see. I was day dreaming about jannah and I had more motivation to do random sunnah prayers. 1 year later, I'm still on the deen alhamdullilah. I usually watch one islamic lecture per day (1-2h), listen and read quran (45m). I've stopped listening to music, masturbating and every sin inbetween. I didn't mention that because I want praise, I mentioned that because I know people would say that I'm depressed because of weak iman. I am not ignorant, I do not believe that just because I say that I believe I'll not be tested. I understand that depression is my current test and maybe my one way ticket to Jannah Al Firdaus (inshaAllah). Knowing that it's a test from Allah swt doesn't make it easier tho. I know it's not a punishment. Allah tests those He love. However this doesn't make it easier tho :( I've cried for 3 years, I don't have a **single** friend. I talk to Allah because I have no one to talk to. This is difficult because I can't hug Allah, I can't play football with Him. I can't do friends stuff with Allah even though He is with me all the time. I don't cry anymore. I don't feel any emotions. My loneliness and depression forms into a physical pain in the chest. It's hard to breathe. I can't find an outlet for my pain. I can't listen to relatable music, nor numb the pain with alcohol and other drugs. If I had to describe my depression it would be like this: Imagine shaitan tearing out your heart and trying to go astray, whilst angels are countering them by dragging my heart to the right. Whilst this is happening I'm the one in pain. Sometimes I just want one side to win to move on but neither are giving up. Whenever I see people with friends I die alittle inside. I would never wish my pain upon them though. Not even on my worst enemy. I've talked to people but it doesn't help. I've tried making a single friend for years but it doesn't help. I go to the mosque to find friends but everyone is basically 30+ whilst I'm only 18. My brothers and sisters I'm going insane, dying inside and I want to give in but I want jannah. I have the best fake smile, people think I'm living the perfect life but only my Lord knows the pain I go through every second. The highlight of my day is sleeping. My nightmares begin when I wake up. It's a struggle to pray but I do it because I must get to Jannah (insha'Allah) to atleast experience the joys the rest of you might enjoy in this world. I want to hate, anyone, anything but I can't. I need to follow the sunnah and not hate anyone. I need to focus my hatred somewhere else or it's going to ruin me from the inside. It hurts, physically. I'm in pain everyday. I'm tortured by my own brain. How do you forget about your problems when you are your own enemy? I don't want to ask for ease in my duas because that will give me hope. I can't bare being disappointed. I'm trying to accept that I'll never have friends, despite having 2b brothers and sisters. What do I do? I can't let my demons win because I'll never see the face of Allah. However holding on hurts like hell. I'm dying inside. I wish I was dead. I'm a shell of my old self. I was broken beyond repair even before hitting puberty. I'm crying right now, which doesn't happen that often, even if no one reads this atleast I can feel my emotions again. If you've read all may Allah grand you, your mother and all your loved ones Jannat Al Firdaus. If you read all of it may Allah give you mercy on the day where Allah's mercy is the only thing thag can save you. May Allah give a shade to you and all your loved ones the day where the sun is a few miles away. May Allah let you, your family, your friends and everyone you care about enter Jannah. Jazakallah ❤️",
1805,"I can't take it anymoreI am a 25 year old female who has been dealing with acne for 9 years. I would say that out of the 9 years I have been dealing with this 1 1/2 of those years my skin was clear. It makes me feel ugly and I have a hard time looking in the mirror. My husband who has been with since we were 17 loves me unconditionally and still tells me I'm beautiful no matter what. I appreciate his kind words but to be honest it can't change how awful my face looks. I want to look nice for him I want to be able to have people look and say ""wow your wife is beautiful!"" Yea I know some of you might think ""wow superficial much"" but that's how I feel. After dealing with this for 9 years I am at an all time low. I have tried near everything! I have spent many nights crying my eyes out and feeling disgusted with myself. I came on this site as a last resort because I just don't know what to do anymore. Here what I do and what I have done: SIDE NOTE: I DRINK PLENTY OF WATER. LOTS OF IT! SO MUCH TILL THE POINT I GO TO THE BATHROOM EVER 2 HOURS. SO PLEASE DON'T SAY I'M NO DRINKING ENOUGH WATER! High School When it all started: Proactive - Tried for 6 months. Worked a little but still had break outs eventually stopped working Neutrogena face wash and acne treatment - Tried for one year did absolutely nothing College. This is when it all went to hell it got way worse: Procative round 2 - Did nothing this time A foam acne solution(forgot the name but it was taken off the market) - tried for 2 months worked a little bit but like I said it got taken off the market Monodox Pill - I tried this for 1 year seriously the best my skin ever was I was so happy. In conjunction I used Finacea( a topical gel) and CeraVe face wash. Worked like a charm. I then went to the doctor because like with my struggle with acne I suffer from severe menstrual cramps to the point where I pass out from pain and throw up. Like I litterally feel like I'm dying or giving birth with no pain meds. Seriously I wish this pain on no one I almost past out at my part time job at the time and they were about to call an ambulance. I have been on 6 different medications to combat these cramps. POWERFUL medications. One in particular Oxycodone. YES a doctor prescribed it to me it's that bad. I'm not a wimp I just have a serious pain problem(needed to clear that up) Anyway I went to the doctor to see if I could get that treated because it was taking over my life he gave me birth control to stop the pain but I had to stop taking Monodox because I personally felt like I didn't want to be taking too many medications at the same time. I was on Birth control 6 months. It worked! not pain or anything. My acne even stayed away. BUT I had HUGE clumps of hair coming out and I looked up one day my hair was so thin I could see through it. I cried and I felt what the hell am I doing wrong? What the actual fuck? I was also having terrible mood swings. So I stopped taking it. And the cramps came back and so did the acne. So I went back to the dermatologist to get more Monodox. So I get on that for 6 months and for some reason My body started rejecting it. I began to feel very ill after taking it. I made sure I ate before taking it and it still didn't work. I threw up everytime I took it. So I stopped. I continues to keep my face clean washing with CeraVe and using Finacea. My acne started to come back. So I went back to the dermatologist and she recommended I take dairy out of my diet and see what happens. I did what she said and my cramps went away and so did my acne. I was so happy I went a year and a half without it and no breakouts or cramps! After Graduating College: Then all of a sudden this year March to be exact the shit comes back again with no warning. I have had NO dairy at all WTF. I thought maybe it's something I ate or my body wash ect. Now till this day 8 months later I am still getting breakouts and scaring. between that time I sent back to the dermatologist told her what happened that it just randomly came back without warning and that I had been doing none dairy diet. She gave me a prescription for Doxycycline and Acanya(acne gel) because Shock Shock Monodox was off the market. I was getting married in August and I couldnt walk down the isle with my face looking jacked! So I took it for 3 months and I swithced from CeraVe to Cetaphil face wash because it was making my skin oily. All I had was 3 months till the wedding and IT DIDN'T WORK. My breakouts calmed slightly but it was still bad. Luckily the power of makeup saved me on my wedding day. Present day: I still have acne. It's so depressing and I don't know what to do. I even went to the allergy doctor to see if I really was allergic to dairy and they said I WASN'T. WTF? So I'm going back to get tested for everything. There goes my savings! I hate this so much I hate looking like this. And people will ""say just use Accutane"". Hell NO! That stuff has so many side effects it's not even funny. People have taken it and 2 years later they acne comes back. That stuff is dangerous. I'm tired of being drugged up. There's no telling what internal damage has been done with me being on all these medications. Between the menstrual medications to the acne medications I just feel so tired of it all. My grandmother is a breast cancer survivor and I fear that I might develop breast cancer with all the crap I been taking or might have to take. If ANYONE knows what I should do after hearing this long story about my struggle PLEASE by all means tell me something I haven't heard! P.S I even went Vegan for a month just to see if it would do anything. NOTHING.",

He doesn’t smoke ‘ a lot’ 3 a day usually and works pays his bills etc. Trouble is my family have always smoked cigarettes, many dying of cancer or having the worst cough so I grew up hating it, told myself I’d never be with someone who brought that into a home.

It is so much harder to know that he is the one who doesnt want to be with me, then it is to find out he cheated but is willing to prove himself for forgiveness. I just cant stop crying. He seems so happy. Hes doing so well, making great money, women love him. I see him follow girls and vice versa on instagram, I DREAD fridays because I wonder ""where will he go tonight?""

Before just now, I've really only thought about how I wish something were to happen to me so that I would die, but now I'm actively thinking about killing myself. &#x200B; About therapy, I do go to a therapist through university counselling but I don't want to talk about suicidal thoughts with her because she is obligated to report it which I don't want.",
1846,I feel like dyingmy(23f) boyfriend(22m) of 3 years cheated on me. we've been in a long distance relationship for the majority of it but live together during the summers and i usually see him twice a month. he knows about everything that is wrong with me and my severe abandonment issues. I bought a pc a few months ago and his broke so I let him use mine. He finally bought a new one so he gave mine back finally. he forgot to log out of all of his social media and there were all the messages between about 5 different girls. my heart is so fucking broke. i confronted him and his reaction was to just block me on everything. no explanation nothing. I am hurting so badly i can't even describe the pain I feel. How am i supposed to move on. he is the only boyfriend i've ever had and i'm graduating this year we had plans of moving in together and getting a dog and I just don't understand what happened. I literally want to die.,
1852,"After taking care of my mentally ill mom and sister for a couple years as a kid they’ve gotten better but I feel like dying.I’m sorry that this is long. TL;DR is the title. My mom and my sister (5 years older, I’ll call her S) have a long list of mental illnesses. My mom has mostly recovered and my sister is getting better but around 2014-2016 when I was 11-13, things were REALLY bad. Without going into to much details, my parents filled for divorce and some other things happened which broke my mom. She attempted suicide. She ended up in the hospital for two weeks and was diagnosed with a stack of mental illnesses and was put on meds. She came home and S and I basically took care of her but S wasn’t doing well and was getting skinnier and skinnier. My mom was cutting a lot, I walked in on her a few times and she didn’t even notice me. So much blood was dripping from her arm, so damn much blood. What is an 11 year old supposed to do when he sees this? I had no clue what to do so I ignored it. My sister was doing worse and worse and was eventually diagnosed with an eating disorder as well as a couple other things and put in a hospital. Of course this didn’t help my mom’s situation and the cutting got so much worse and she was sleeping all day because of her meds. After my sister got out of the hospital, she tried to commit suicide a few times. For quite a while there was daily screaming matches between S and my mom. One would start to get upset about something then the other would get upset because the first person was upset and it would just keep escalating, all while I sat there and pretended it wasn’t happening. I’d see fresh bandages on my mom’s arm and ignore it, I’d hear my mom or my sister crying in her room and ignore it, I’d see my sister secretly working out and ignore it. I though that bringing attention to it would make them upset so I didn’t. They forgot my birthday that year. At this point, I, a 12 year old, was now taking care of my mother, my older sister and myself. I made all of my own food, cleaned up the house, got myself to and from school, and made sure my mom and my sister were both breathing when I came home. I took care of them but at the same time I ignored what was happening to them and I ignored how I felt. I thought that I couldn’t cause any problems or voice how I felt because I was worried that if I wasn’t okay then everything would fall apart so I became the rock, the person that they didn’t have to worry about. I was so focused on making sure that I ignored how I felt that I stopped feeling anything. After a few years, they’ve both slowly gotten better but I’m stuck. You could ask me how I’m feeling right now and I wouldn’t know the answer, let alone how to express it. I’m numb except for the occasional time I’m angry. Other than that I feel nothing. I’m empty. I’m probably missing a lot of events and stuff because don’t remember much from the past few years but some times the stuff I do remember gets stuck in my head. I still don’t like to go out with friends and I don’t even have real friends because I still put on that facade but I try have friends because I feel like I have to be okay and people that are okay have friends. I just stay in my room while my family hangs out with my mom’s boyfriend and his daughter. I don’t care about school because I feel like I won’t even make it to university but I still try to do school work because my mom yells at me and gets really upset and calls me lazy if I don’t. Everyday I think about how much better everything would be if I was dead but I feel like a coward because I haven’t done it yet. There are two reasons I haven’t killed my self yet: 1. Attempting suicide is something my mom and S would do and I want to be nothing like them. 2. Slitting your wrists and taking pills have too high of failure rates, there are no tall buildings around me and I don’t have access to a gun. Those are starting to feel like they’re not good enough reasons to keep living. I know I’m depressed but I hate admitting it because of what my mom and S being depressed did to me. I’m just so done with every thing and I don’t even know why I’m writing this.",

I’ve also watch A Million Little Things and that makes me feel so sad. it also has stopped me from killing myself because even though the characters are older, it still could have the same impact(s) with my life. i don’t want to suffer anymore and i want to die, but i also want to see my future. i’m just afraid i’m not gonna have the willpower to stay alive until then.",

1859,"[M]21 Intense stomach pains that make me feel like dying?Age: 21 Sex: Male Illnesses: Lactose intolerance (maybe?) Height: 5""7 Weight: 130lb Hi, I sometimes have really horrible stomach pains that could last up to 2-3 hours. I can usually feel when it's coming on and run to a toilet to try to get it out. By ""get it out,"" I mean that if I ride the waves of pain I could try to push out some poo and after a couple, it's like I get past a gate and all of my stomach empties in diarrhea form. The stomach aches are so intense that there are times I black out, can't breathe, shake, parts of my body go numb, sweat, and can't think about anything except the overwhelming pain. Before, I mentioned that it's like a wave—the pain seams to peak and decrease regularly—not exactly like throbbing, because it's not fast. The peak of pain could last up to 30 minutes each time. I know pain has no relative scale but I'm no stranger to pain (being in fights, getting beat up, being cut, falling and breaking something) and out of all of those times I would rank my stomach aches at the top. These stomach aches don't happen all the time, they occur maybe once every 2-3 months. Also, I don't think it's constipation because the last time I had one of these, I pooped an hour or two before and before that, I was going regularly. After I diarrhea, I seem to be okay but of course completely empty and a bit weaker. After my wife witnessed 2 of these, where she was on the brink of calling an ambulance, she now insists I go to a doctor. Before I do that, I thought I'd check and see what the good folks of Reddit think. I should mention that I did not eat dairy before this happened.",

1866,"Feel like dyingI just came back home from a week of staying with my mom and sisters pretty much binge drinking every night and being an embarrassment for the most part in AZ. I got kicked out of a concert for being too drunk, lost my DL, things of that sort. My mom was asking if I was ""okay"" a few times, to which I said yes and continued to drink. Apparently I passed out one night with my little sister, she let my mom know. The anxiety is just so bad when I'm not drinking, I'm so worried about everything around me all the time. The withdrawals and depression when waking up are so terrible. I live in Alaska where it is dark and cold in the winter. I don't know who I am without alcohol some days. So today, I just got back from that AZ trip and ended up drinking not only one, but 2 bottles of champagne or gin that was leftover in the fridge and woke up to my boyfriend sleeping on the couch and all the booze hidden or poured down the sink. Chairs, I dont know why I am still here. Trying to drink water and am just wondering how to apologize to my boyfriend and wonder how I'll cope when our 1 year old son wakes up. To give a little back story, my boyfriend is about 20 years older then me, we have been together about 3 years. Before him I was in a 5 year relationship that ended horribly. Anyway we had a baby together and mom life is stressful. I'm going to college too part time. I dont know why I am so self destructive when I have a good life for the most part.",

My hair feels like silk on my exposed shoulders, while his, seem like angel feathers in the dimly-lit room. Rapture. He smiles and looks at me in a way that I can't recognize. Before I could even contemplate his eyes, he answers with small laugh ""Oh, I just liked the way the style looked, not much of a story there"", I giggle but I feel empty, I love his laugh, his voice and everything about him. I'm not ready to go back. ""How about..."" my hand who previously was resting on his chest, slips away to his upper arm, touching every inch of his skin in my trail, my bare breasts pressing lightly on his side, one of my painted nail rakes soflty against inked foreign letters ""...this one ?"" A smile is still present on my face but I can feel my eyes watering, my hands shaking and the agony deep in my chest is growing bigger and bigger. I hold him tighter but his warmth feels so far away. His smile feels so calming. ""This one is prononced toska, it's russian-"" he explains tenderly but can't figure out the rest of the sentence. No matter how much I try to drown in this atmosphere, I can't help but feel things that don't belong here. ""I love you"" I hear.

I have slowly been getting better but hit a low tonight. I feel like I’m the only person in the world who thinks he did something wrong. Porn is so normal and everyone thinks it’s healthy and maybe even good. I feel like I’ve been cheated on for three years. I watched for the past few months occasionally, our sex life was crappy in my eyes, we had sex maybe one a week or every two weeks. I’ve thought about killing him while I’m sitting here not sleeping, and he’s sound asleep. I think about killing myself constantly. I didn’t think it was cheating before, that it just felt like cheating, but now I see it differently and I feel completely cheated. I feel like we both cheated on each other and I don’t think I want to work through this. I want to leave and be alone forever. I don’t think I’ll ever find someone who doesn’t watch porn so I think I’ll just be alone until I inevitably kill myself.

1901,"UPDATE: My (21m) best friend (20f) found out that I have self harm scars and has told our entire friendship group (19-21). They are now excluding me from almost everything.[you can find my original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/csy8ds/my_21m_best_friend_20f_found_out_that_i_have_self/) I know since the internet doesn't like to be left hanging, so I thought I'd give you guys the update on my situation. It's sadly not the happy ending that I was hoping for. After I read all the advice on my original post, and responded to PMs and answered questions, I decided I'd message each friend individually to ask if the general consensus of the group was really what Allie said it was (with everyone being uncomfortable, and preferring that I didn't come to the beach). Through doing this, I sadly found out that Allie was telling the truth. Every single person in my friend group except for 2 said that my scars would make them uncomfortable at the beach (keeping in mind, I never said I'd go to the beach), and they'd rather I didn't come. I told them all how much it hurt that they'd say this to me, and how upset I was that I was basically being abandoned by my friends, and that I didn't want to associate with them anymore because of how hurt I felt, and those messages were met with either no reply, or simply ""I'm sorry, I don't know what you want me to do about that."" As for the 2 friends who weren't uncomfortable, they both confided in me that they have also struggled with self-harm in the past and were disgusted by the behaviour of the others in the group. One of people has chosen to stay with the group, and the other has told me that she'd like to remain friends, but still hang out with those people on occasion So in conclusion, I lost 9 friends, I feel like shit, and I don't know if my self esteem will ever make a recovery from this. Have a wonderful day, wherever you are. **EDIT: For those commenting ""you didn't lose 9 friends, you lost 9 people who didn't care about you"". I understand that they weren't my friends, my wording was poor.**",
1902,"I just found out my 16yo daughter self harms...My beautiful, talented, fantastic daughter has struggled with depression for the past year or so (officially at least) and is now on Prozac which has, outwardly at least, really worked well. She's also seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist. She's back in school, involved in extra-curricular things, painting, etc, and seems happy. My father passed a few weeks ago and she had a panic attack in the cemetery, which was her first in \~10 months or so. Yesterday we get a call from the school counselor that we needed to come get her, as she was talking about 'hurting' herself; we were able to get her a session with the psychologist later that day and she seemed sort of ok by the time I got home from work. This morning my wife was able to get her out of bed and into the car to go to school (no small feat after yesterday ;( ). On the 5 min drive over, my wife sees some scratches on my daughters thigh and asked her about them. My daughter burst out crying that she did it yesterday (hence the hurting reference) and has thought about doing it since last year. Telling my wife seemed to give my daughter some relief, and she was able to go to school today. My question is, now what though? I am very close to my daughter and want to support her, I'm just unsure how I can do that? My wife and I speak openly with her about her anxiety and depression, so I' believe we have a relationship where she could feel free to share if she wants.

1903,"AITA for asking my sister to cover her self harm scarsOk so I know how this sounds but I have to know because it’s really getting to me. So my sister is four years older than me and right now she is living at home having just left University and is looking for a job. When my sister was seventeen she was bullied really badly and due to this she would self harm for a really long time. I don’t know how my parents didn’t notice it but when they did they took her to therapy and eventually it stopped. She’s come a really long way since then and I’m so proud of her but she still has scars on her arms that are clearly noticeable. I’ve never been depressed or self harmed so I’m not in the right position to tell her what to do and I can’t even begin to imagine her point of view. However around the house she always leaves her arms bare and most of the time it’s fine but it really really upsets me sometimes to see them because it makes me so angry that someone could have bullied her to the point that she did that. I know I’m being selfish by saying that because it’s not about me but it’s beginning to affect our relationship as whenever I’m around her now I just feel so sad. I casually mentioned that I could see the scars the other day when we were alone and she got really upset and started crying. I instantly felt horrible and I wish I had never said anything. I don’t know how to fix this and I need to know if I’m being unreasonable. Edit: Thank you to lots of people. You put this in perspective for me in a way that I never could have done on my own. I’m an idiot. A massive fucking asshole. I thought that because I loved her it meant that what I was doing was the right thing for our relationship. I want to clarify that they don’t make me ‘uncomfortable’ they just make me want to sob and hug her forever. But yeah, that’s my issue as many of you stated and I have to deal with that without shaming her (which was never my intention). I’ve read every single response to this throughout the day and I want to thank people for their honesty. My sister always refused to talk about it because she didn’t want to upset me and that’s her choice. For now I need to book a reservation at her favourite restaurant and apologise.

1904,Why I self harm : reason which I have not heard of beforeThis was the first question which my parents asked me when I told them. And when I eventually went to a therapist it came up again. And then again when I spoke to my friends about it. I thought about it for a long while. The reasons which my therapists(T)/ I (M) thought were : 1. Control (T) : I thought about it and I have never felt in control after a sesh. The endorphins reduce the stress or the feeling of isolation but never did it give me control. 2. Punishment (T) : There were times when it was for punishing myself for fucking up but so very often it wasnt that. 3. Outburst (M) : Wanting to get the self hatred a physical outlet. I hate myself and regret my life decisions and habits and all that hate has to go somewhere because it was wrecking havoc just sitting in my head. and up until now I always thought it was 3. It made sense. BUT recently it struck me I think another aspect of it is : when I cut I know I exist. I have a physical effect on the world around me. I am not a data point in some statistic. I have a real tangible effect on my surrounding. That is probably why cutting deeper is so appealing. I can have big noticeable impact on the world around me. More pain or more blood means I did something well. It was a job well done which is good break from all the failures of life. I dont know if this is retarded or not. I would like to hear other peoples thoughts about it,
1907,"Is it common to not physically self harm, but mental self harm?In other words, is it common to purposely put yourself in isolation even thought you don’t like it? Or purposely alienate yourself even though it makes you feel worse? Is mental self harm real? Edit: I’m actually talking specifically about isolation and rejecting opportunities in favor of reclusiveness and hermit-like behavior.

1949,"Depression isn't just self-harm or suicide.Depression is sitting in your room all day rewatching the same show for the third time because you fear the outside. Depression is listening to the same three songs on repeat because they remind you of a simpler, better time and because you're afraid of venturing outside your comfort zone. Depression is not eating anything for three days straight simply because you forgot. Depression is thinking about not being alive for so long that you're not sure you *are* alive anymore. Depression is staining your pillowcase with tears so much no one even notices the stains anymore because it's just how it looks now. Depression is hovering in social interactions not wanting to say anything because you feel like you'll bring everyone down or God forbid be shamed for feeling and being the way you are. Depression is all that and so, *so* much more. If someone tells you they have depression, don't go, ""That's nothing. I have a friend who cuts his wrists. *That's* real depression."" Depression isn't a dick-measuring contest, it's a fucking disease, and it should be treated like one. You don't tell a Stage 4 cancer patient their cancer isn't real because they haven't died to it yet. If you do this to someone, and they end up killing themselves because they felt that no one was listening or that their problem wasn't real, their blood is on your hands. So unless you can deal with the knowledge that your actions have caused someone to take their own life, when someone opens up to you don't tell them that's, ""Nothing"".",

I've dealt with self harm on and off for years, but I relapsed again recently and I've never been able to really talk to anyone about it. I see a therapist every three weeks. It took me years to see one about my issues, but I've been going to his appointments faithfully for three months. First I asked what he was obligated to report, and when I was certain that he wouldn't tell someone, I confessed that I had done it recently. He is always so soft spoken. The first thing he did is thank me for trusting that secret with him. Then he asked me if I needed medical attention. What an incredibly nice thing to ask. I was so moved - so *relieved*. In the past, when I trusted that with someone else, I was either met with indifference or anger. His patient and understanding is such a nice difference.",

Later, he said to me ""When you feel like self harming again, think of your safe space, or imagine cutting your child self. Imagine cutting a little girl who is crying in the corner."" It took me aback. He made a point that I never thought of. Self compassion. Thinking of cutting my child self feels disturbing. It also made me realize just how cruel I've been to myself. My child self just wants love. Why would I hurt her like that? EDIT: Wow, thank you so much for the feedback and the gold!! I woke up to so many nice comments.

1960,"I almost ruined my life by getting engaged at 19. XXL, TW self harm/sexual assault.Before I get into this story, I want to mention a few things. First, sorry if it runs a little long, as it takes place over the course of about a year and a half. Second, this story does contain sexual assault and self harm, so just be forewarned. And finally, I hope that no one can relate to any of the things I went through, but I know that won’t ever be the case. So I hope hearing this helps anyone who has been through anything similar, and if any of this sounds familiar, please know there are ways out, and please don’t feel that you have to suffer in silence. All that being said, here's the story of how getting engaged at 19 almost ruined my life. Some background: I was in a relationship for five years, the beginning of 8th grade through the middle of my freshman year of college. It was an incredibly stable and loving relationship considering we were two awkward kids who just really cared for each other. When it ended, it wasn't on my terms, and I was completely heartbroken. At some point during my relationship, I had been to a fancy-ass holiday party with my mom, and had seen a very cute guy. He looked like a young, emo Rod Stewart, and was obviously as out of place there as I was. We were briefly introduced, and I found out that his name was Will. I bemoaned the fact that I would probably never see him again, and nowadays I wish I had been right. It had been several months since my relationship ended. I was mainly recovered, though I had attempted a rebound over the summer that had failed miserably. So I was okay, but still in a weird place emotionally. I was also very very stressed because of school, pretty much constantly teetering on the edge of a mental break. Thankfully the semester was over, and I could finally relax. My mom mentioned the fancy ass holiday party, and after months of papers, group projects with sorry excuses for human beings, and cafeteria carbs, this sounded perfect. So I was modestly drunk, sitting with my mother and her two closest friends, old hippies having a passionate conversation about something. And as I look up, I see the guy from three years ago. The one I thought I would never see again. He had a beard and long hair now, but otherwise looked the same. I dribbled champagne down the front of my power suit and smacked my mom's arm repeatedly, slurring ""There he is!!!! The boy is here!!” My mom ended up reintroducing us, and later on, with my second dessert plate and fifth(?) glass in my hands, he sat next to me and we got to talking. He was easygoing and funny, and was immediately enthralled by my blue hair and tattoos, which my parched ego drank up. Eventually he left, after we had exchanged Snapchat and Instagram handles. We talked for the next two days, and when I came home from being upstate we video-chatted on Discord. Before I go any further, I want to reiterate the state of mind I was in for most of this story. I had not had sex in over a year. I was desperate for someone to give me the affection and love that I had lost. I had just met someone in a way that sounded like a fairytale, the beginning of what might promise to be love. As a result, I did what so many people do in bad relationships and overlooked things that ordinarily would make me run the other way. You will probably think I’m very stupid by the end of this story, and you’d be right. I was stupid. I was desperate. I was naive. But I hope you’ll understand why. Over the course of this call, we talked a little more. He was drunk, and I would later find out he had a bit of a drinking problem. (Within 5 minutes of us starting this call, he demonstrated how all his neighbors out in Long Island were gone for the winter by screaming the n word at the top of his lungs. I was mortified, but again, my standards were lowered given the circumstances and I chose to overlook this.) He cried about his brother being depressed as we were discussing mental illness, and stupid me mistook this for emotional availability and vulnerability, two traits i really value in others. He told me how he had seen my Instagram and thought I was really funny and hot. Boom! More ego boosts for the sad, bloated college girl! He asked me to be his girlfriend, and I happily said yes. Then (get ready for the jump, kids), we ended up having cam sex. It was exhilarating, I’ll admit. Finally, my redemption. A new start. We arranged for him to take the train to come see me in New Jersey next week, during his days off. There was no first kiss, no tender gazes. He bit my neck, hard. Another huge red flag that I happily wrapped around myself like a girl on an 80s hair band album cover. We full on fucked, and because he hadn’t brought any condoms and I hadn’t been on birth control since my breakup, I went out and bought plan b like a responsible adult. When he found out I had done this, he got pissy that I hadn’t told him. Weird, but whatever. So began my relationship with Will. We would alternate; he came to my house on his days off, next week I would go out and see him, sometimes missing class to stay at his house. I still can’t believe I sacrificed my education for this schmuck. The first few months were pretty good. He would visit me at my dorm, staying at his parent’s place in the city. His parents were a world away from mine, and his relationship with them was not good, to say the least. He was adopted, and he seemed to resent everything about his parents refined, Upper East Side lifestyle and their goals for him. His brother was their natural child, a Cornell student and overall the complete opposite of Will. This definitely didn’t help matters, and I learned to dread seeing his parents as it meant an inevitable argument. I actually have videos of me sitting quietly, looking into my front camera while he and his mother scream at each other. They were both at fault in terms of how they handled these situations, but Will was almost always the first one to be unnecessarily rude or immature. More on this wonderful dynamic later. It was April, we had been dating for about 4 months. We were FaceTiming and he, waving yet another enormous red flag in my willing face, fucking proposed to me. God, I wish I could appear in my shitty dorm bathroom, smack little 19-year old me in the face, and scream “RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!” But alas, I couldn’t be there for myself when I needed me most. So as the last of my intuition begged me to listen to it, I once again said yes. As if this choice wasn’t stupid enough, we got engagement ring tattoos the next week when he came out to visit me. I chose red, to resemble those Tibetan heart string bracelets. It made the tattoos look like cuts, which I guess is appropriate. Now that I think back on everything, Will and I really didn’t have much in common. The few interests we did share were the outdoors, weed, TV shows, and tattoos. So most of our hanging out consisted of smoking, watching tv, and sex. This was nice at first, but quickly got boring. I started to feel like Grandpa Joe lying in bed all day in the dark, knowing the world was going on outside my window. I could try to talk to him about things I liked, but he either didn’t seem interested or didn’t understand. He would cut across me in the middle of my sentences to exclaim about some unrelated thing, but if I did this to him accidentally he would get incredibly offended. He started calling me several times a day for up to three hours at a time, often just to complain about something that had happened to him while driving or at work. I rarely got a word in edgewise as he would go on and on about himself, his car, other people’s cars, his problems, racist comments about his Hispanic coworkers, how shit his life was. If you had a visual of me on the phone with him, you would be looking at me sitting in complete silence as his voice prattled on in my ear. He had a horrible, self-pitying attitude about him, and it didn’t take me long to realize I was already sick of this. I realized a lot of things early on, but this part of me that knew I should get the hell out of dodge was frequently shouted over by my temporarily boosted self-esteem, the comfort I got from being in a relationship, and the fear of disrupting that comfort by standing up for myself. Will would constantly make me doubt myself. When I mentioned going back to school for a teaching or counseling certification he shot this idea down immediately, saying it would be too expensive and take too long. Meanwhile, he wanted us to move in together, so he could work while I...also worked? His reasoning was that he wanted to enable me to do whatever I wanted by making a lot of money, so basically “put your dreams on hold while I work and you stay home and rely solely on my cash flow to support you.” No fucking thank you. I’ll share some incidents that occurred over the course of our relationship, just to give you an idea of the kind of person he was. Once he yelled at me on the turnpike because the gps was freaking out, and I was trying my best to navigate us home as he lost his cool. He told me I “needed to stand up for myself,” referring to my parents, my friends, the GPS? Yes, he actually told me I shouldn’t let the GPS walk all over me like other people do. Apparently having a loving, close relationship with your parents and friends is submissive in the eyes of someone who only knows what a dysfunctional relationship looks like. The best part of that interaction was that HE was the one person I needed to stand up to, the biggest bully in my life. The first time he hung out with my friends, he was wearing pajama pants, and apparently the head of his dick was poking through the fly like a shy naked mole rat. Mercifully, my friend did not tell me this until long after we broke up. He was really weird about my cats, convinced that they needed “obedience training” and “to learn some respect” because they would sit in weird places and scratch the rug occasionally, which anyone who has cats knows they just do. He had also never owned a cat but thought he knew more about their behavior than I did. There was an instance where he told me that he had gotten into a hot tub with a female coworker. This alone didn’t really bother me, until he said how much he would like to fuck her if I would let him, how attractive and cool she was, and how she just seemed to “attract men with her pheromones.” He didn’t understand why this upset me. To quote him, “I’m just being honest with you.” When we were out with my parents one humid summer night, two middle-school aged girls walked by wearing shorts. He started going ON about how he would never let his daughters out of the house like that, how inappropriate it was. I asked him why he was looking so intently at preteen girls. His 1950s-esque mindset also extended to food: he was the pickiest eater I’ve ever met, and I’m pretty sure his idea of a meal was either red meat, frozen food, or white rice and ranch mixed with hot dogs and peas. That last one sounds like a post on r/shittyfoodporn, doesn’t it? Well, he brought me a container of it once. It was soul-rending. Once we went to a Wendy’s, and he got so pissed about the slow service that he actually called their customer service headquarters to complain. I think he was mentally both 14 and 60 years old; it would explain a lot. I saved up money one year to get a big tattoo for my birthday, which he gave me endless shit for once he found out how much it cost. In that same conversation, he told me how much he wanted to pull all his stock and spend it on a new truck—when he was still paying off his new car. Just one more horrifying thing I learned towards the end of our relationship: at some point, Will had formulated a plan to KILL HIS PARENTS and attempted to carry it out, though he wouldn’t go into more detail when I asked exactly what he did. All I know is the police and an ambulance were called. When I think of him telling me this so casually, the way you would tell someone you were worried it might rain later, every hair on my body stands on end. So, just how fucked can one person get? Well, I was about to find out. I’m going to skip ahead to July of 2019, where everything reached a boiling point. The month of June had begun with our first real conflict, which I won’t go into detail about but I will say was the catalyst for the end of the relationship. We had been trying to rebuild, but it really wasn’t working out, much to my secret relief. I had finally opened my goddamn eyes to the horrid situation I was in, and I made up my mind to break things off at last. Of course, realizing I had a crush on one of my coworkers was a helpful bit of motivation to do this, but I knew to get to that point I had to end things with Will, as scared as I was. So I went out for one last weekend to cement my decision, and I got out to Long Island around 5. Will picked me up, and he was going to be working a later shift starting around 6:30 until 12. We got to the house, and I’ll say here that you should skip ahead or stop listening if you’re triggered by the thing I mentioned at the beginning of the story. Hell, it’s hard for me to write even now. We got inside and I set myself up in the guest room, and Will said he wanted to try something before he went to work. He left the room and came back with some rope. We had done this before, but he said he didn’t want to do anything, just wanted to tie me up in a way he hadn’t done before to see if it worked. I said okay, thinking he would just untie me when he was done checking the knots. He tied my arms together straight down my back and asked if it was too tight. I said no, and he inspected his handiwork. Then I felt him pull my shorts down. A sour taste filled my mouth and I said nervously “I thought you didn’t want to do anything.” To which he replied, “I changed my mind.” I don’t think I’ll ever forget those words. He had purposely immobilized me, perversely preaching to me how bondage was “all about trust” as he did it, fully intending to take advantage of me the whole time. And he did. I asked him to stop, I said no, I squirmed. Nothing. No indication that he heard or cared. So eventually I gave up and just lay there. It was over quickly, true to his pathetic nature. He untied me, and I saw him off to work. Trauma can be a slow burn, and I was seemingly okay for the rest of the trip. Later the next day he got in a fight with his mom, who came out unannounced knowing I was also out there. We picked her up and I had to endure that car ride where the fight happened. We got back and I took a long walk on the beach. Will sat outside smoking cigarettes, and when I asked if he was coming inside he said “Why would I do that? There’s nothing in there for me to come back to.” Right, just your fiancée who you raped 24 hours ago. Nothing important. The emotion of the past day caught up to me, and as the giant sack of shit I called my fiancé sat outside brooding like a 14 year old edgelord, I did something I had promised myself I would never do again: I cut my leg up with my knife. It was a new low for me, and I realized this was the final straw. I did not deserve to feel this way, and I had put up with more than enough. I left for home the next morning. After another few days of consideration, plus a few more self-pitying phone calls from the grand turd himself, I decided to break up with him over the phone. My best friend sat by me as I called him, holding my hand. I got straight to the point, saying “I think we should break up.” To which he replied, “...What?” I repeated myself, and he hung up. Just as I was thinking, “Well, that was easy,” he called back 10 minutes later, sounding weepy. He didn’t understand why I wanted this, he thought I was the one. I was, regrettably, still trying to be civil towards him to some degree, so I told him the distance was presenting a problem for me. Mind you, he had been bitching earlier about how much it sucked to be in a long-distance relationship, telling me he didn’t think I could possibly know what it was like. He really was that stupid. He still didn’t understand, wanted more explanation, more reasons, none of which he really deserved. I made the mistake of telling him we could still be friends, to which he said “Right, like I’m going to come out to Jersey to hang out with someone I used to fuck.” And I think that summed it all up for me. That was all I was the whole time, and if I had stayed with him that’s all I ever would have been: a sex object. I said “Okay, don’t contact me then, I need space. We both do.” And I hung up, smoked a joint with my friend, and had a good laugh over how pathetic it all was and how much better I felt. Over the course of the next few weeks, a lot changed. I had lost 30 pounds over the course of the year, which could have been from dropping out of school but was also most likely stress from everything I endured. My skin cleared up, even my hair seemed healthier. It was like my body started repairing the damage done from the outside in. I wasn’t sad over the breakup, but I was angry at myself and him. I had lowered my standards so far for some douchebag I romanticized because we had met previously in a semi-endearing way. Will continued to try and text me, despite my repeated insistence that I needed space. He wanted to know what I was going to do about my ring tattoo, and I told him honestly that I wasn’t going to do anything. In another attempt to manipulate me, he amped up the melodrama, saying he might cut his off. I said, “K.” It really does feel good to disregard the feelings of someone who has done just that to you for so long. He texted after I removed him from my Instagram followers and deleted our pictures together, saying “Nice touch.” Will continued to ask why I had dumped him, and when I finally told him the whole truth, that he had hurt me so many times and never listened to me, he went for the remorseful route. He said he would do anything to make things right, he would “even try counseling.” He texted saying there was a “weird light” on his roof one night and he was scared, just attempt after attempt at getting an ounce of pity from me. I finally told him I would MAKE space if he didn’t give me any, having concluded that I did NOT want to be his friend, acquaintance, or fleshlight any longer. That finally got him to stop. I sent all his stuff back, shot my shot with my coworker, and picked my ass up off the ground, ready to start being myself again. I’m going back to school in January, working at a new job meanwhile. My former coworker is now my boyfriend of six months, and he’s an absolute angel. He’s given me more love and support than I ever could have asked for, and I feel incredibly lucky to have him by my side through all of this. My parents and friends have also been my lifeline. The scary thing is when I told my mom about everything he had done to me, she had no idea how bad it was because I had barely been talking to her—and I didn’t even realize it. Will had managed to monopolize my time and isolate me so completely that my own mother didn’t know what I was going through, until I finally got away from him long enough to think for myself. It took a ton of validation from my friends to realize everything he had done and said to me was so much worse than it seemed. I definitely have trust issues that I’m trying to work through as a result of all this. A part of my brain tries every day to convince me that I am easily replaceable because there are more attractive women out there, and it’s been incredibly hard not to let my experience color my perception. As someone relatively inexperienced in relationships until recently, I had no real measure of how I should be treated by a significant other, and Will’s manipulation and general shittiness made me realize what I’m willing to put up with, even when I shouldn’t. I’ve heard the statistics that one in three women will be sexually assaulted in their lifetime, and I never thought I would be the “one.” But here I am. Some days I wish I had fought harder. Some days I wish I had the chance to hurt him like he hurt me. Most days I just take my anger and focus it into moving on and healing, because that’s the only thing I can do. If you made it to the end of this, thank you from the bottom of my heart for listening. Sharing has helped me tremendously. Finally: Will, if you hear this, I’ll see you in hell. And unless you want to experience being neutered, let’s never, EVER meet again.",

1998,"Yall I just miss my baby (maybe trigger? a little self harm mentioned)My ex-husband is my ex for a reason. He had BPD which by itself is bad enough but mixed with my depression it was a perfect storm... for him. I lost a baby from a previous relationship near the end of the pregnancy and he was there to scoop up all the pieces and give me all the love and affection I needed. He then proceeded to manipulate me and everyone around me to where I was completely alone. No family, no friends, only him. Then I found out I was pregnant again, so soon after losing the first one and it was terrifying. I relied more and more on him for the emotional support and for a little bit I had it. When my baby was around 7mos old he convinced me to marry him. At this point, he had convinced me to be a stay at home mom but we lived with his mother. And she is passive aggressive AF but that's for another sub. &#x200B; After getting married it just spiraled. He was a ""recovered"" alcoholic when we met and no one really explained that meant he was always going to be an alcoholic. He started drinking again and getting meaner and more distant. We would fight and he would project his crazy onto me. He told me for years that I was the one who had BPD, not him. I apparently ""loved"" to fight. Yall I was cutting myself to ribbons trying to deal with the emotional assault I received from him. I carved the names he called me into my flesh just to feel a little relief from his torment. &#x200B; When my daughter was around 1.5yo, he decided to quit his job and apply for disability and told me I had to work. His cousin got me a spot at a daycare, monitored by his cousin and the director was biased towards me because of it. I worked while he sat at home (again, his mother's house) with the baby because even though other teachers could bring their children of any age, I wasn't allowed to and was too terrified to fight it because of the way my ex shoved me into my shell.. After working a 7am-6pm day for minimum wage (5 days a week) I would come home to him passed out with no one watching the baby. While at this job she also fractured her leg... he says she slipped on a book. Now I'm not sure because was he even conscious? I have so many regrets about this entire situation but you can't change the past to I tried to move forward. &#x200B; In 2015 we finally divorced. Or rather I finally realized the abuse he was placing on me was rubbing off on my child. At this time I still had no friends or family so when I left I slept in my truck until I could borrow a room for a little bit. I was sure I had no place to go because of the things he told me. The lies he had pounded into my head over the years. I didn't know there were shelters I could go to with my baby. I wish I had done that because he has made sure to rub that mistake in over and over. I left her because I thought that was what was best for her. I bounced around a little, discovering new friends that told me he was crazy for doing what he did, telling me I was in the right, not the wrong. We went to see a divorce attorney and I discovered then that the manipulation doesn't stop because I'm not there. He told me if I didn't sign these papers the way they were that he would take me to court and I would never see my baby again. Who was I to argue? I didn't know I had a choice or that I could fight what was there and still have my child. Because of that, he has mostly full custody, I mean basically. I get to see her every other weekend and for certain amounts during the holdiays. Okay, that's fine, I thought. I don't know if I can survive as a single mother and my ex had sweet talked me up and down about how I could come get her whenever I wanted. &#x200B; I know, I know - how dumb am I? &#x200B; As the months go by, I attempt to see her and he denies it. Says it's the wrong weekend. The job I had at the time rotated weekends, so one on and one off and he made sure to set it up to where my weekend with her was when I worked so I saw her for a few hours at best.... but okay. I get to see her some. I don't like it but I'm not going to fight because he still terrifies me and I still think he can keep her from me. When she starts school he files for child support even though I told him I would cover her insurance fully and give him whatever money he needed. He never said she needed anything, they were always fine.......... okay whatever cool. I start paying child support even though with his disability he gets a check, not to mention he had 24k in backed disability. I had nothing. I didn't even try to take it. I didn't know I had a choice. At some point it kind of chilled out and we got on a set rotation. I think these align when he decides he wants me back. He gives me what I want in hopes he can lure me back. &#x200B; Recently him and his gf have had trouble, so I guess it was time for him to take it out on me. My daughter has been different for as long as I can remember. When I started working at the daycare around a ton of kids, autistic and not, I realized she may be autistic. I suggested testing and counseling, since it was coming out of my pocket anyway. This didn't start until last year and it was because a teacher said it. So she is going to be tested at some point but I don't know when that is either. That's another thing, I am supposed to be included in EVERYTHING concerning her schooling and any therapy or doctors visits. All of it. He gave me none. &#x200B; At the start of November of this year he told me he no longer wanted my boyfriend around my baby (okay fine) and then his next message was that I would no longer see her unsupervised. I argue with this. It's my right as her mother (and in the custody agreement) that I get unsupervised visitation and private conversation, like phone calls. He denies me all of these. He tells me that I make bad decisions and says the therapist says she needs structure but that going to my house every two weeks isn't structured.... This coming from a man who still will not teach her to wipe from front to back and to brush her teeth every day... even though he is being reminded by numerous people to do this. He has also been sleeping with her at night which since she is 8 seems a little messed up. &#x200B; I didn't fight a lot once I found out I could because she is currently at a school surrounded by people I thought had her best interests in mind but I feel like keeping her away from her mother is never in her best interests. We had a sort of sit down between him and I with his cousin (who apparently just liked to please both sides because her stories changed as soon as he walked in the house) and she even tried explaining to me that it was really just the overnights that were causing her anxiety when she went back to school after I'd had her for the weekend. So I said well let me take her and bring her back before bed? They say no, has to be supervised (idk why, I've never done anything wrong or illegal around or with her, even though I know he was smoking weed around her and was managing to do coke and mushrooms while he had her too.... so either she was with him or at someone else's house, which is also messed up because the agreement says I have to be the first option for babysitting and he NEVER offered me that.) which is stupid because he is saying that it has to be someone he trusts to supervise.... yeah that's not how that works. They say ""what's normal and familiar to her on a daily basis is what's best for her""... BUT that I can come see her at his cousin's house....... which is just as familiar as my house........... but I digress. &#x200B; I spoke to a lawyer before Christmas because I was supposed to have her from Christmas Day at 5 until yesterday at 5. Instead I got to see her for about 4 hours this past Saturday. The lawyer told me to go like I was going to pick her up and record whenever he denied me visitation. To call the police and file a report. I did this on Christmas Day and the day after. I now have to save money that I don't have (because I pay him so much and cover my child on insurance even though he is supposed to, so more than half my checks go into his pockets) to hire a lawyer that I can't afford, just to see my child when I'm supposed to unsupervised, even though I have done nothing wrong. I even pleaded with him. Just let me go back to the way it was so we don't have to go to court because she doesn't need any of the extra drama. He says she'll be fine and in fact, the last two months away from me she has been sooo happy and has barely asked about me... &#x200B; What kind of person who loves his child and three months ago claimed to always love me would tear their child away from their mother like this??????? &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; ugh. Thanks for reading if you did. And thanks in advance for any replies. I just had to vent a bit.",
2002,"Spamming suicide hotline numbers at depressed people or suicidal people doesn’t seem that helpful.You know the last thing I think most suicidal or depressed people want to hear is? You need to talk to someone. You should talk to a therapist. You should call this hotline. You think they haven’t fucking thought of that? No shit. It’s the first thing anyone says when someone is depressed; you should talk to a therapist. Honestly? I don’t think there’s a way to measure it, but if someone calls that hotline I don’t think they were going to do it anyways (other than the ones that called it and did it on the call). It’s just annoying to me that when people say they’re depressed and society sucks, and they joke about (or are serious about) killing themselves, no one ever offers real solutions but just says “call this random number and talk to someone, oh I just know how you feel I’ve been there before” Edit: this seems split in terms of popularity. I’m gonna take this time to lay out what worked for me. Feel free to tell me I’m an idiot, but I swear to god this worked for me. You know what pulled me out of my slump? Realizing all of these other styles of help were bullshit, and that it was entirely my own mental state. If I was going to get out of it, I was going to have to be the one to make changes. At face value it sounds silly, but I really internalized this idea. I forced myself to stop relying on other people for my own happiness. It made me a more cynical person towards society as a whole, but damnit if it didn’t help I don’t know what did. Realizing society’s shortcomings were what put me in that place to begin with made me understand that in order to overcome, I was going to be the only one that could truly change my own personal mental well being. I took this mentality to heart, and started focusing on things like hobbies. It wasn’t easy, but I spent my time learning to do things like play guitar, or build circuits, or get really good at a certain video game, or produce beats, etc. This idea may be a crock of shit, but I gave this advice to another one of my depressed friends telling them I thought the advice people generally give is bullshit. I actually found that giving a bleak response of understanding and being real with them and not being all “yeah, talk to someone!” Etc. was more helpful. If you can actually relate to how that depressed person feels instead of just telling them everything will be okay, you have a better chance of helping. They don’t want to hear “everything is okay”, they want to hear “yeah you’re right everything really is fucked.” If you can truly relate to them and the way they feel without trying to tell them how to fix it explicitly, they’ll appreciate it. Edit 2: I should have been more explicit when I wrote this. I'm sure hotlines help some people, I'm not saying they don't. I'm also not saying therapy doesn't help people. Edit 3: Here's an analogy. Your friend is in a hole (depression). You're standing outside of the hole. You're shouting phone numbers down into the hole and saying things like ""you're gonna be fine, it's okay"". In reality, it would be much more helpful if you could jump into the hole with them and show them the way out. Edit 4: Damn, front page. Thanks for the silver. Love y’all reddit mafk’s",
2007,"If your feeling depressed maybe this is a good read for you. :)So, I've been extremely depressed for the past like 5 or 6 months. And today was honestly an all time low.

Ik that took a little dark turn but hey its reddit. Tonight, I've decided there are pros and cons to me kmsing. The pros list has one sentence: I give up, and none of the cons are enough to make me change my mind. The cons list goes on forever: I'll ruin my family. I'll make my friends extremely depressed. I'll miss out on all the beautiful things in life. I'm going to hell. I have the chance at beating all these demon inside me. I won't see pretty sunsets, have a girlfriend, get closer to god, my parents, make new friends, etc infinity. So, tonight, I have made the decision to keep living.. but now that I've made this decision, that means I'm living life on my terms. I'm listening to myself. I'm doing what feels good for me, and what I know with all this wisdom I've gained over the years. My revelation is to not give up. Take life into your own hands. It is never too late. Opportunity will never cease, doors will never stop opening. Hope this helps someone out there.",

2011,"Does nearly everyone get depressed knowing you will never be great at anything or contribute anything of significance?I get in these moods realizing I will never be exceptional, no matter what hobby or profession I take up, there will always be a few hundred million people better than me. How does everyone deal with this, are we supposed to be okay with just existing and being a minor cog in the machine? Edit: I am an optimistic nihilist/absurdist, but just because you have a philosophical belief doesn't mean you are 100% at peace with it. Logically I have no problem with this question but as a human being, my thoughts, emotions, and actions are often hypocritical of my beliefs. I don't expect an answer but hoping that maybe there are millions who feel the same but still keep on ticking. I don't want to be famous, I don't want to ""matter"" to someone, I just don't want to be useless. Also I am asking to get a sense of the general public's thoughts and feelings because I want to address this topic in something I am writing.

2030,"AITA for not wanting my depressed wife to have dinner with another man?I (28M) have been married to my wife (24F) for about 4 years now. We're best friends, and we love each other. Over the past few months, my wife has been having quite bad anxiety and depression. We've been talking about it quite a bit, and I've been as loving, supportive and understanding as I can be. One of the things she noted was that she really feels like she needs a support network among friends, and that she feels like a lot of her friendships are a lot more valuable and deep, since she feels like they're quite superficial now. She used to have a close family network, but she moved country and has lost that, so it's understandable. However, one of the people she has chosen to become closer with is a guy called Rob. To be frank, I don't like Rob. Rob is insecure, to the level where she has shouted and argued at me before for ""questioning"" his expertise at a board game, by disagreeing with his outlook on the game. He constantly mocks me, and projects his insecurities on me - an example being that he is a window cleaner (not a bad job), but he received an economics degree, and he constantly tells me I need to ""get a better job"", and I need to ""achieve my potential"". My wife knows I don't like him. This is, to be fair, probably aided by the fact that when we initially met, my wife expressed that in a strange way, she finds him attractive. I've told her that he annoys me, and I don't feel comfortable around him. She has been spending more and more time with him. I've told her how uncomfortable I am about all of this, and that while I understand she will probably not cheat on me, I feel she may be having an emotional affair. She has, basically, dismissed me, and told me that I'm being a bit ridiculous. I've not told her she can't meet with Rob - I just told her that I feel uncomfortable with how much time she's spending with him, and that I don't like him. I work for the emergency services, so I work long days (8am to 6pm). Today, we were talking, and she told me how she won't make dinner for me tonight, because she's going to Rob's house, because he offered to cook for her. I have issues with this: 1) I don't like Rob. 2) Dinner is when my wife and I usually sit, talk and bond. I feel like she's choosing to miss this out. 3) I don't get cooked dinner. When she's working and I'm home, I cook for us.... 4) I don't get to see my wife. &#x200B; Look, I understand she needs a network. And I understand I might be being a bit insecure with all of this. But I can just see this turning into an affair. So on the phone call, I told her how uncomfortable I am with the fact that we won't only not be having dinner together, but she'll be having dinner with another man, and that man is Rob. She told me to not be like that, and hung up. AITA in this situation?",
2033,"Not Even Sad Anymore. Life Just Feels Like a Waste of Time.I think my textbook depression has finally settled in again. Buckling in for a wild ride. Maybe this time it will finish killing me, and I can be at peace.",
2035,"How do you deal with accurate reasons to be depressed? 30/FI know this is gonna be harsh but I envy people who are depressed without a reason. They probably just need a medication and therapy to get better. I can't do that as it won't change anything. At best, I will just stop caring about my shitty life. Here are all \[or just half\] of the reasons why I don't wanna live anymore. CHILDHOOD Fucked up, I was beaten, screamed at, my parents should have divorced years ago. It was toxic and made me angsty, insecure, socially disabled girl. No real friends, I have always talked to myself and my imaginary boyfriends or friends and I still do. Once I finally left for college I felt lost. I stopped feeling constant fear but had no mental resources to make any real friends or relationships. I have experienced multiple rejections \[emotional, romantic, career-related\] at this stage of life and never got over it. The only thing I was good at was school. Nobody gives a shit about you if you are no trouble maker, just a moderately talented, extremly shy girl. I was so alone and disscociated I could talk to myself for hours. We were poor so no fancy clothes, holidays, family activities or any experiences a normal teenager should have. My parents tried hard at that point, and I don't wanna blame them, but finally poverty got to them and they just destroyed their relationship and whole family. They have never taught me how to be a productive, active person with goals and a talent for earning money. I come home twice a year, for a day or two. I know they are hurt, but I am so sick of their yells and constant humiliation. RELATIONSHIPS I've been rejected by people I was in love with. I am just too ugly, too weird, too shy. I confessed being bisexual to my parents and it was a living hell. I have never mentioned it again. My first and only relationship started when I was 23 - we're now engaged but I don't wanna get married \[no money for it, too much anxiety over family issues, difficulties with taking responsibility and organizing anything, I literally cry when I think about it.\] Simple, low-cost wedding is out of question - his family wants a real party. So we're getting nowhere, it just a stalemate. Now I have crushes for fictional characters and I still long for one person I was really infatuated with. I and my fiancee were happy but now I think I just desperately wanted to be with someone after my severe breakdown related to lack of any romantic relationship. I had no money, no chances for a job or place to live and I felt so unhappy and lost that he was a real savior. Wonderful man, true gentleman. He just doesn't know how to deal with my depression anymore and it starts to affect him. We are living together for over 5 years and I don't wanna end this as we do have so much in common and, let's face it, it's just easier for someone so severely depressed to be dependant. I know I am cruel, but without him I'd be long since dead. I do have some people who wanna see me and meet up but I no longer can catch up with them financially, emotionally, in terms of having a nice job, home, children. I don't wanna see their success as it only hurts me more. WORK/CAREER I am 30 years old, working in a shitty recruitment outsouring office I hate. I hate everything about this job and I can't change it. I tried to find a job for over 3 years after I finished my useless master degree and no luck. I tried applying my dream jobs, I tried to be a freelance copywriter, I tried to have a blog with some income. I just wasn't good enough for any of those and if not for my former colleague I would not be accepted here as well. I can't and don't want to be promoted as I barely stand my current duties. I am financially dependent on my fiancee as I would not be able to pay for my place without him. I earn very little comparing to my co-workers because I don't have strength, motivation and courage to ask for a raise or to constantly change jobs. GOALS As mentioned above I have no career goals. Any other ones are just out of my reach. I feel like having a constant fatigue syndrome. Add social anxiety and travelling & going out is nearly impossible. I wish I could travel and see some world, but I cry and get scared off at the moment of booking plane tickets. I have actually been away for a few days and it was scary as hell, I came back so stresssed out. I wish I could have a home or an apartment but I don't have money. I'd love to be a housekeeper, to pick up decor, furniture, wall paint, to make a home. We are saving up for years and fucking prices just get up higher and higher. Every year our goal is getting further away. I live in a shitty, old, one room apartment and we can't even rent up something better because then we couldn't save cash anymore. I am 30 years old with little chances to get married or have a home so I gave up hope for a baby as well. We can't afford wedding and apartment, how can we afford a baby? After all I am a fucked up adult kid myself, how could I be a good mother for someone else? LOOKS/ Other issues I have no energy, no motivation, all I do for years is playing games in my free time. I can't force myself onto some sort of effort to do anything else. I tried some easy going sports, I gave up after a day or two. I got fat, and I have still not overcome my teenage insecurities. I hate my body as well which impacts my sex life and social life. I have never had an orgasm with my partner and I've stopped trying. I feel extremly weak, physically and mentally and I hear people telling me this as well. You're lazy, you are not resilient, you're neurotic. You want an easy life. I have a perfectionist OCD. I am no longer surprised or disappointed when something in my life blows up. What did you expect, you stupid bitch? You're a failure, it's just another one. I wish I could reload my life as a different character. I've been living so long with depression, neuroses and anxiety that I don't want to know who I'd be without them. Definitely not myself. I have my first psychiatrist appointment within a few weeks and I hope he'll just give me meds that will make me indifferent. I hope I won't run away. It's fucking expensive but I decided either that or I will kill myself. He can't change my shitty life and I can't change it either.",

2048,"Need advice on dating someone with depression who won't communicateI've been dating this really awesome guy for a few months - he was really upfront about having depression and anxiety and has had therapy and medication about a year before I met him, but stopped with both since he was in a better place at the time. A couple months after dating, some symptoms for an upcoming depressive episode started showing. He replied less, was less affectionate with me, wanted to sleep all day, didn't want to go out anymore, etc. It was terribly difficult for me to know if my messages were helpful/nice or just annoying, because he didn't reply most of the time, but we still managed to hang out once a week. Then a few weeks ago, there was a death in his family which just made him plummet to a really deep depression. When this happened, I wasn't in town so the best I could do was be there for him through messages. Because of this tragic event, he went back to therapy and is back on medication. After not being in town for 3 weeks, I asked when he'd be free so that we could see each other since it's been so long. I've previously mentioned that I'm all for laying around and just watching a movie. He's mentioned that ""he doesn't want to pretend like he's okay"" and I told him he doesn't have to pretend with me, he can cry all day and I just didn't want him to be alone, to which he responded ""I need to be alone."" I'm never trying to ""cure"" him, I really just want to support him. I'm in no place to tell someone how to live their life, I just want to be in each other's company the way we always used to be. On the last day I talked to him, he had just hung out with one of his oldest friends. So in my mind i thought, ""Cool, he's capable of leaving the house for something that's not work."" So I asked him if he'd be free sometime, to which he again replied ""I'm sorry I just need to be alone right now."" I told him ""Okay, I feel like I haven't respected your request to leave you alone, I'm going to do that now. Please reach out when you're ready to talk or hang."" And he just responded, ""Will do."" It's been a week. And he posted on his social media that he went to a soccer game, which is something that he loves so it made me happy that he's out doing that, but kind of sad that he still hasn't been able to message me, especially since we've talked every single day when we first met. I'm just confused if I should message him again to let him know I still care about him. Or did I just get dumped over message without realizing? My mind is honestly all over the place. I have a great support of system of friends which helps me take my mind off this whole thing, but I haven't talked to any of them about this because I don't want them to know his personal business. So here I am asking for advice from strangers lol. Any advice would help, thank you!",

I have many school friends, even considered somewhat popular to some people as I tend to be the class clown in my classes. What people don’t realize is that I don’t actually have any real friends, only lots of “acquaintances” that forget about me once school ends. I don’t get talked to out of school, asked to hangout, checked on, so I usually spent most of my free time working out or writing raps. The only socialization I get outside of school is with my workout partner who I consider my only true friend. I started working out 3 years ago after being bullied during soccer season and although I’m thankful to have transformed my body to look alright (hoping to compete in physique competitions and also do triathlons) it hasn’t made any difference in making friendships and I feel it has actually isolated me since it’s the only thing i enjoy doing. I don’t fit in with any of the people around me, I feel as if all the the effort I put into being a good friend is becoming a waste of time as it’s never reciprocated at all. I’m a secondary friend to everyone and it is incredibly lonely. I’ve never had a love life or a first kiss. I feel all the work I put into making myself a better person (exercise, good in school, reading) has made no difference and left me as someone who doesn’t fit in with anyone.

It's that feeling of not enjoying anything anymore, not even food. I know it will probably pass, but really how much more can i take?

My dad left my mom for a girl my age, and my mom shared too many details with me every day for months on end. I found out so much more than I ever wanted to know, watched my mom cry and wail for hours every day, and felt stuck in my moms house for months even though I’m an adult and could have left to go back to my home to Tennessee. I eventually did but I regret not having gone back sooner and maybe doing less emotional damage to myself by staying there. I’ve been emotionally numb since the beginning. Feeling like I’ve been robotic and unfeeling, dissociated from the world. Yesterday was the first time I cried in over a year of feeling blank. Every time I hear a sound that sounds like crying or yelling I tense up and have an internal panic attack. So many sounds trigger that feeling and those memories. I haven’t talked to my dad in over a year. My girlfriend of one year who I’ve been in love with for years just left me because I wasn’t making enough progress in life from being so stuck, and I can’t bring myself to trust anyone enough to even have talked to her about everything I feel, or to be myself with her as much as I wanted to be. And I couldn’t even enjoy my time around her because I was always so anxious that I would do something wrong and be inadequate, that I would feel physically sick and have to find a bathroom to retch. I feel cynical about everything, I feel like I’m watching the game of life play out all around me and I’m just looking at how meaningless and pointless all of these lives seem. I’m a 22yo guy with almost no friends, no social life, and no ability to concentrate in school. I can’t work in a normal job because I can’t talk to people without getting extreme anxiety. And I don’t even feel the drive to work a meaningless job for no reason, since it won’t even matter in the end. I know I should be in therapy, but I don’t trust therapists or doctors anymore for some reason. I feel like I can see through the advice they give and it just feels meaningless. And I’m so far in debt due to unpaid medical bills that got caught up in my parents divorce, and on top of everything my dad took my entire life savings from a lawsuit I had after my brain injury and says that I don’t have any claim to it anymore. I was told time would heal these wounds but it all just keeps getting worse and I don’t know how to get out of this. It feels like there’s 2 people in me, one who wants to keep fighting, and the other that has just given up after years of struggles. It’s just hard to see any future for myself Rant over, thanks for reading. I’ve kept all of this just bottled up inside for so long, it’s nice to just get it out and share it.",

The other supervisor been trying to get me fired since i started because im 26 years younger than him. I just started my senior year in college im 32 btw . school just got really hard so im dealing with that .my major is management so im actually really upset cause now that i know how much management sucks i dont want to do it anymore but if i change my major ill hate to be in school for an extra year plus. I came home from work yesterday and my gf had took all her stuff and moved out while i was gone. We been together for 10 years and was planning on getting married after i finished my degree . but she comes from a rich family that owns a lot of real estate and they bribed her with a free house if she moved back to her home town . She said that I can come too but her family hates me because i have a regular job and her mom never had to work a day in her life so she look and me like im nothing because he daughter is not a house wife like she is.

I'm so anxious all the time. i can't even go into a store by myself . like what the fuck is wrong with me?? im too fucking pussy to kill myself although i want to badly. i want my best friend back. i wish i had friends. i try to make friends but it fucking blows up in my face. i just really wanna blow my fucking brains out. sigh.",
2089,"Finally spoke up that I don’t appreciate my “best friend” using me as a backup when other ppl cancel on her and her telling me about it. She responded with immediate rage telling me everything she’s ever done for me (wtf I’ve done more for her) and didn’t acknowledge anything.She blocked me and I’m sad. Sad at her rage, of her having a COMPLETELY fake persona of being generous and I’ve never wanted to accept anything in the past and always given back - material gifts, shouting lunches, emotional support, constantly replying. Got sick of her collecting new friends every single day, even when we went out she’d ditch me to talk to new people to collect them for “play dates” (both mothers) and EVERYONE including the mail box down the street was her best friend, even someone who didn’t know she wasn’t working for 6 months when we were all talking together - just as an example. I was her “best friend” as long as I was meek and mild and never said anything to how I feel, and constantly replied to her and said how awesome she was. The SECOND I didn’t talk to her much for a week, and finally said how I feel in regards to saying “this persons cancelled, are you coming over” i was the worst person in the world, I called her out in text message after that, not rudely but sticking up for myself. Saying if you were truly genuinely generous you would acknowledge my feelings which are based in fact, and not immediately go into a rage of things you’ve done for me (all of which I didn’t want to accept - places she wanted to go she took me, I didn’t want to go, a dinner she made out was just for me when she invited a million other people, which she always did with plans) I don’t bring this up to her but I’ve bought her kid so much stuff to not look like I’m taking advantage, she buys my kid one thing and gives her random “new best friends” extravagant gifts so they’re beholden to her and she’ll always have someone, I’m just sad that this seems to keep happening - having friends that take advantage of my (not saying I’m great but kind nature), I’m in a town with no family and thought she was actually a good person. She collects friends with babies or kids so they’ll play with her child and can’t be alone for 2 seconds of the day. She doesn’t get that I’m mad how she generally used everyone - lining people up then crossing them off for her fucking play dates, thinking I do nothing with my time but wait for her and want to message her back constantly. I had my suspicions before but wish I never said anything to keep the peace, I’ll see all her friends at kids classes and no doubt her again and feel sick to my stomach in general. After I shut her arguments down which made no sense because she was saying it was a one-sided relationship, she then said “I’m glad when people cancel because I can hang out with you” and that “her life is amazing, her kids amazing, she has the best friends in her life” (I.e. she’s so much better without me already,) She was literally a devil in disguise and I knew me speaking up would never go over well but I did NOT think it would be this sinister. I’m posting this in depressed forum because I have social anxiety and depression normally and this has really fucked me up. How can I trust anybody? I have only one other friend who also just calls me up when she’s free but she’s at least not sadistic. Only one friend now and I’m 31 and have nobody except 2 children to invite to my kids birthday party. It makes me so sad, just having a family birthday party but I have to travel to them",

And then I saw how easy it is for other people to make friends, to get into relationships, to worry about things that actually matter and how easy it is for them since they don't have to overthink 24/7.

I (F17) have an excess of people who rely on me; my mother, father, grandmother, grandfather, and boyfriend. It’s to a point where on a day that I interact with all of them, I am so emotionally exhausted that I can’t perform in my extracurriculars or actually focus on homework and studying. My mother has essentially made me her new parent. I cook, clean, do her laundry, draw her baths, and honestly everything short of wiping her ass. It’s like I’m a single parent taking care of a child. I’m living in my grandparents spare bedroom. My mother is $40,000 in debt to the IRS, we can’t even get a house, and I feel so responsible for it even though I’m just a teenager and can in no way help. I feel like I’m assuming the crimes of my reckless teenager, it’s unfair and exhausting. When I ask for the simplest things in return, I’m treated like shit. All I’ve wanted to do is be in the school musical this year, she said I can do it, but my mother complains 24/7 over a 15 minute trip to get me. It’s so frustrating. It leaves me feeling like even trying to be a teenager is beyond asking. While it’s not as extensive in my father, I still take up his responsibilities often and do his laundry. My grandparents are ill and on a bajillion medications, so I help around the house; cooking and cleaning as much as I can. While I don’t feel as though they pressure me into it as much, it’s still an added strain. My boyfriend relies on me constantly. It’s to a point where it feels like all I do is babysit him so that he doesn’t do anything dumb or hurt himself. It’s unfair. I’m extremely mentally ill, yet I only managed to be able to take care of him when he needs it, ignoring my own problems. I’ve put him before everything, my schoolwork, my hygiene, my social life. I just want to not be burdened by everything. On top of all of this I’m taking all AP/honors classes this semester. All of them are extremely rigorous. I can’t find the time in between being a mother of fucking five. Even the man I need to mentor me for my senior project (it’s required to graduate) feels as though I’m helpless and that my dreams are futile. In an email he told me “I wouldn’t recommend art as a career path to anyone... if you have a Plan B you’ll eventually do it, and I can say that without ever seeing your work” AHAHAH god that hurts. All I want to do is pursue art, whether it be through teaching or freelance, and even this feels hopeless. Life is meaningless without any true joy.

I've simply moved from one thing I didn't enjoy to the other thing I didn't enjoy. Drifting through life doing as I'm told, never doing what I want. Yet I don't know what I want. I feel trapped in my home country, an outsider disconnected from everyone and everything, faking smiles to please loved ones and fainting interest in activities I go with my friends. I've had little luck in finding love. I can't just walk up to girls and charm them because I don't know how to charm. I only know how to take an opportunity when it presents itself, and even then it's when I'm not sober. Being an awkward person doesn't help in the matter, especially when I'm not completely comfortable with the local language (which I grew up with), despite being bilingual. No matter what I decide to do with myself I'll eventually grow to despise it, and with that I grow to despise myself a little more for being unable to fully commit to a decision that I've made. This cycle has been going on for years. As has the dark thoughts in my mind that come and go. Killing myself isn't an answer. Going to the funeral of a childhood friend and occasionally seeing his parents shows me the grief suicide brings, and that Isn't something I want for my parents. And yet the dark thoughts keep returning, no matter what drugs I put inside of me. Earlier this year my biological father died, and while it was cancer and a deadly infection that killed him, it was more of a suicide. He never went to see doctors, and yet he kept pumping poison into himself (cigarettes and contaminated cannabis), kept alienating himself from his friends and family (joining hate groups and the like), until he eventually died alone in a hospital bed. I don't know what I'm doing with myself, and I think that if I stay here I'll eventually just die the same way my father did.

While in highschool I wasn't popular though. I didn't get girls. They'd often make fun of me or outright ignore me. Yes I know the start athlete still getting ignored and made fun of. It happens.

I went to college and my athletic career met an end as I was too injured and then my parents kept trying to make me become a coach they still do to this day. Besides my freshman I literally did not leave my dorm or apartment besides work or food. I stayed inside playing video games and drinking beer. This was mostly due to depression. I went to therapy but the therapist gave up on me stating that I was not ready. This made me even more depressed so I started to gain weight after I stopped working out. Now I graduated college with my useless degree. Can't find find a job while everyone else has one who was in my field. Some time later I'm a janitor at a school so 5 years of college for that. I'm fat now with no energy or interest in life in general. I also live with my parents until I can find a real job. So yup. I'm a fat kissless virgin who lives with his parents and can't get a job other then mopping floors on a 8th grade hall. Thankfully I dont use social media and nobody cares about me enough to check and see how much of a loser I am. So ya. TL;DR : athlete in highschool but was kind of a loser. No real career after college, but now an even bigger loser and now fat",

I can't find a job and that's not without a lack of trying but living in the highest unemployment areas in the country is killing me.

2108,"I have lost my will to live and really have no reason to liveHi. I’m a 19 year old girl. A few months ago I left my parents home to live with my boyfriend due to my abusive, alcoholic father. My boyfriend and I live 9 hours away from where I lived with my parents. At first everything was perfect but here recently, like the past month, he has been treating me horribly. He has never ever hit me, it’s all emotional and manipulative abuse. I wouldn’t call it abuse because it’s not very bad, but I’m not sure what other word would work. Anyway basically that has been escalating and I just feel worse and worse about myself every single day. I see no point in living. I don’t have a job even though I’ve applied for well over 20 jobs. I don’t have a car, and I don’t know anyone here except my boyfriend and his family. I want to run away but even if I go back to my parents (who hold no grudge over me leaving), I know I will still see my life as pointless.

2142,"I have no reason to live...This probably going to be a long post. I literally have no one but my boyfriend in my life. I am close to no one else. My parents are shitty - my dad doesn't keep in contact with me and my mum only messages me when she wants money or to use me, either to bitch about my sister or to talk about her new boyfriend (yea, my parents recently got divorced. One day, my mum decided that my dad was controlling and manipulative, so she filed for divorce. She lied that he used to beat her. Apparently my mum was cheating on my dad with 3 guys aswell...i dunno. My dad is no angel either. He does have some controlling behaviour, and anger issues). My parents are questionable people. They once called the police to hack my tablet at home (they told them I had gone missing and was doing drugs???) and they found messages between me and a friend (who I'll mention later on) talking about suicide. So they go searching for me and find me (I was with some friends, and my parents knew about it), and take me home. My parents grounded me for a while. I do have siblings - a half sister who doesn't keep in contact, a younger sister who I occasionally talk to but we don't have the kind of relationship where I could vent my problems etc, and a little brother who is too young to understand what I'm feeling. I do adore my younger brother, though. I've been very close to him until I moved away for uni. I used to have a cool group of friends at sixth form, I could be open with them about my issues, and I enjoyed hanging out with them. When we went off to different unis, none of them but one kept in touch. And the only one who kept in touch ended up backstabbing me. She really hurt me. I still remained friends with her for a while, but she was a toxic person and several people told me it'd be best to cut her off. So I did. I did have one really close friend back in a small town I used to live in. She too struggled with depression, and we were really open with each other about it. Mid GCSEs, my parents decide to get rid of the house and make us move elsewhere, dragging me away from the one good friend I had. When we moved, we stayed in a BnB, while looking for a house. My good friend and her mother even visited, because she missed me so much. My family were only there for a week, until we were kicked out because my father couldn't pay the bill. So we were homeless. My friend said her mother wanted to just take me and my siblings back to our old town, but of course that'd be classed as kidnapping. We were given emergency housing. We didn't have furniture for a few days, it was all in some storage place. We had no heating or hot water. I had to sleep on the floor and use my coat as a blanket. It was a horrible time. When we got our furniture, we had to wait a month to get wifi. My friend and I wrote physical letters to keep in touch. I am still in touch with this friend but we have grown apart over the years. She has her own problems and has a baby on the way - I can't make her worried over me. I haven't been able to make any close friends at uni. I suppose I have some people you could call a friend, but we're not properly close in any way. They know nothing personal about me, and I still have big issues with initiating and keeping convos with them (I have social anxiety). I have tried other ways to make friends. I even made a post in a reddit here, but I got a lot of dms and I got too overwhelmed and ended up ghosting everyone. Besides, it felt forced, and not natural. My upbringing wasn't the worst, but it certainly wasn't good either. My parents' families hated each other so we never spent any time with them - my grandparents on both sides much preferred our cousins. My parents had a lot of financial issues - my dad was even declared bankrupt. We always struggled for food, and I never got to do cool things other kids did. My parents never bothered to spend much time with me. For example, when I started school I was very behind in reading compared to everyone else, because my parents wouldn't even read to me. I managed to find a passion for reading as a kid, and caught up in a few years, even surpassing a lot of the others. I got bullied all the way through school, aswell. Mostly for having glasses, being quiet, having small boobs, not having expensive clothing and for doing well in school. I didn't have a romantic relationship until I was 17. Before that, I had only been ""intimate"" with one man. And it was something I didn't want. It was the first time I had ever got drunk, and my friend left me with someone I didn't know...next thing I knew, he was touching my genitals. Anyway, I seemed to have hit puberty later than other females. For a while I struggled with my sexual and gender identity. I felt less feminine than others, because of my small boobs and different interests. I was very conflicted and it took a few years to figure out. When I eventually came out as bisexual (I didn't plan to, but my sister found my diary and told my mum, and she told my dad even though she promised not to), my dad was rather upset with me. He is a bit homophobic. My mum's family also slated me for it. So, my first relationship was not good. My ex was 10 years older than me (yes, it sounds so bad now, but I was naive and just wanted love ok). It was an online relationship and we met in a game, where we had been in the same guild for over a year. He did raise major red flags in the beginning, as he asked me for nudes not even 2 days into dming me. I refused of course, and he wasn't very happy, but he got over it. We were together for 6 months, until he finally broke up for me because of my anxiety. It was a toxic relationship. He often made me ""make it up"" to him for any argument we had, by threatening to break up with me if I didn't send him nudes. He didn't want to tell anyone about us, but he wanted me to make sure all the people in our guild knew I was off-limits. He'd often compare me to his ex, talking about how attractive she was, etc. He belittled me and didn't take my emotions seriously, even laughing at me when we argued. He did all he could to stop me from talking to friends and other people, but he hated spending time with me. He lied often. He cheated on me. It took a while to get over the relationship. I didn't think I could love again, and then unintentionally I found my current boyfriend. I've had depression and anxiety since about 13 years old (that was when I was first diagnosed as a result of my sister discovering I was self harming, so my parents took me to the doctors). I've been in and out of therapy and counselling, trying different types. One therapist was meant to see me twice a week, but she only saw me like once a month as she always had other emergencies. I couldn't open up to her so she discharged me from the service. I have only properly attempted suicide back in May 2015, where I took an overdose. I certainly did not take enough to do any major damage. I have planned to take my own life many times after that, I even wrote out a bulletproof plan to hang myself. I never went through with it of course. I'm currently in my second year at uni. I have almost no contact with any of my family. I have no close friends. I only have my boyfriend. I struggled a lot with severe depression, loneliness and anxiety during the first year of uni. Towards the end of the year I was not going to any lectures. It was a surprise how I got decent grades. At the beginning of second year, I had a depression session and cut myself extremely deep. I should have went to the hospital really, but I am living with someone who wants to be a doctor. I saw all the blood and the fat on my arm, the deepness of the cut, and panicked. I messaged her telling her I needed some aid. She fixed me right up, but after that, she'd sometimes message me saying ""you're not slicing yourself again, are you?"" which wasn't nice to hear. The start of year 2 has been bad. I had no income for a while (my parents decided to dawdle with my loan application so I had no money, as I don't rely on them for any financial support). I couldn't pay rent. I ate little so I could save as much money as possible. I got a part time job just to make ends meet, even though I'm not mentally in a place to work right now. I missed an exam. I've been in and out of the uni wellbeing service, and trying different meds and dosages. Nothing is fucking working. Nothing is getting better. So yeah, I have my boyfriend. He's the only thing stopping me from doing something bad. I want to hurt myself so bad, but he'd be distraught if he found out, and I couldn't do that to him. Usually I tell him how I'm feeling, but he is currently asleep and I am alone with these thoughts. Thinking about a future with him keeps me going. But at the same time, I feel like a burden to him. I have all these issues that he doesn't understand. I've hurt him emotionally several times because of my depression (no, not by being abusive or anything. Just when he has found out that I cut myself or something, it upsets him). We do have a stable, healthy, happy relationship otherwise. But I don't know how much longer I can fight the demons in my head. I've been trying to get better for years, but nothing has improved. I just seem to be getting worse. I don't know how and if I should tell my boyfriend that I really do not want to exist anymore. I don't know what to do. And if I were to keep living, what's to stop my boyfriend from leaving me in a few months or years time? Then I'd have just suffered for nothing. Please help me.",
2143,"I have no reason to live right now my life is a total mess.School has always been difficult for me. I wasn’t a fluent reader until middle school, where I started to perform academically after getting medication for my ADD. I still struggled because of my dyslexia. Before my diagnosis, my parents had no clue about ADD/ADHD and constantly thought that I was being a lazy defiant kid. My dad was too strict on my grades to the point where he’d yell at us for bringing home anything lower than a B. No matter how hard I was trying. He’d even threaten to ground us if we didn’t meet his expectations. So I was dealing with constant pressure in addition to having learning disabilities which made school a nightmare for me despite doing decent. Sometimes I’ve had to lie to him about my grades to save face. Anyway, I did well in high school, and earned a 3.42 GPA (no AP/Honors), but a 20 on my ACT (after my third attempt). I’ve always struggled with test taking. My first semester went well, just under a 3.00 but my second semester I ranked. It’s not because I didn’t have the study skills, I just wasn’t prepared for university level work nor did I have the intellect to compete with all the other students there. I struggled to keep up with the lectures. I couldn’t tell my parents because I knew they’d yell and berate me. What did they expect? An ubermench of a son?! Did they really expect me to be the best?! Why couldn’t they just accept that i wasn’t cut out for college. After my third semester I was put on academic probation. Despite attending all my classes doing all the work yet I still bombed most of my exams. I wish my parents back then would have told me that other options existed outside of university. Maybe I’m just not smart enough. It takes me a while to understand concepts as I’m a slow learner. I struggle with processing language. My IQ probably average at best. I struggle to think on the spot and it’ll take me a while to come up with a solution to a problem. I didn’t tell them until I was 5.5 years into my degree that they found out that my GPA was low. I changed my major from accounting to liberal studies and graduated. It’s not like I would have found a job in accounting anyway as my grades were too low. So here I am, currently 26 years old, unemployed, living with my parents and can’t find a job. I’m thinking about going back to school, but I’m not sure which field to pursue. I’m plan to start at a Community college and then transfer to a university. I haven’t told my parents the plan yet because I’m not sure that they would agree to support that. I honestly wish I didn’t have a learning disability. Complaining about it is a waste of time so I have to live with it. I know that I’m still young and got time, but I just can’t help but compare myself to my friends and everyone who I knew from high school and college who currently are working and building careers. Most of them are smart and don’t have learning disabilities, and can’t relate to my struggles. Has anyone else screwed up my life as badly as I have?

Whatever happens in that dream will be forgotten, never to be seen again. So what is the point in making decisions in that dream, or even continuing it when after all it will never matter. The same logic applies to death, what's the point in fearing death, when in the end you won't be able to comprehend anything happening after it. No one will ever truly know when they died, you have no consciousness to know it with. If you are fearing death for the fact that you will lose all the memories you gained, what's the point? you'll never be able to comprehend what you've lost after the fact will you?

I’m gonna explain how I got to where I was now because I feel like that’s important to disclose. My earliest memories of abuse go back to preschool. My parents had attempted to make me Christian from birth to when I was 6 but it never worked, so I was enrolled into a Christian preschool and Christian kindergarten. I was beat and put outside during class all the time by the adults working at both schools, not because of behavior, but because I just couldn’t believe that the excerpts of the Bible that they were talking to all the kids about were real or believable. The kids there were also cruel (I only remember the kids from kindergarten.) The school had a fairly large yard for recess and I just remember being chased to the farthest away corner of the yard by kids a couple years older than me, and then getting beat up. My parents didn’t actually realize that anything was wrong until the summer before first grade. During that summer I was enrolled into a small summer school associated with the kindergarten from what I know. I believe it may have only been 1-2 weeks long but all I remember is that we’d watch a movie on VHS in the morning and then get put outside for a long time despite the heat (heat where I live during summer is usually over 100 degrees for context.) I believe this summer school was located on a separate elementary school’s campus because they had a field. They watered this field a lot but since almost none of the grass was green, there were lots of mud patches. Long story short, I was a dumb, unattended kid, and I played in the mud because nobody told me I couldn’t. My parents took me out of the program that day for not being supervised. We also moved that summer because we couldn’t afford a house anymore, so we moved into an apartment in a different area for grade school. Grade school and onwards has a lot more to talk about so I’ll divide paragraphs by year. 1st Grade - It was pretty standard. This school operated so that in 1st-3rd grade you only had 1 teacher per year, and the teacher I got in 1st grade was a nice old lady who I feel was qualified to teach kids, so that’s a plus. I made a couple of friends, but I wasn’t very social because the apartment I lived in was far away from the upper-middle class neighborhoods most of my peers lived in. I got bullied by kids a year or two ahead of me. There was a situation once where I was once again chased to the corner of the playground where no proctors were present. I was surrounded by 3 kids and they all tried to beat me up. I socked one in the nose and ran. (I should mention that a constant trend of this elementary school was that if you reached the proctor first or you reached her with a group of other kids against another kid, you could easily fabricate a story and get the kid in trouble.) So these kids reached her first, explained that they were playing and I went up to them and punched one, and she believed it. I got detention and a talking to by the principal, but nothing more because the other kids were older. Situations similar to this happened as the year went on, and I was slowly becoming mentally broken. It was at this point that I started my trend of finding hiding places during whatever recess we had to go into a fetal position and cry. The bullying continued in class and whenever I was not hiding during recess, and nobody ever helped me so this feeling just grew. The same act of crying went on for another few years (I think I stopped around 5th grade because we were told that boys don’t cry.) 2nd-3rd Grade - The same behavior from 1st grade continued, except in these years other peers my age and unqualified teachers were to blame for the bullying. A social hierarchy among the kids in my grade was forming, and the “popular kids” (boys on similar sports teams whose stay-at-home moms managed the PTA at our school, which meant special privileges for their kids) found me, a loner boy who was anxious all the time, as good bait. At this time I had a reason to not hide during recess, which was to find a ball to go play with by myself. Of course, I never was able to get a ball before the rest were taken, so I’d often find myself asking them if I could join a game of theirs to maybe have some fun. It never worked out that way though and I was picked on by them (I don’t know why I continued to join them if they were treating me poorly.) My parents took me to a child therapist (who I know now was violating confidentiality laws by not giving me the choice to talk to her with my parents outside the room.) I never mentioned to her what my problems were, only that I didn’t like the sun. 4th-5th Grade - This was when kids started to become vulgar. We were innocent enough before to only be called names, with the most horrifying thing said usually being “stupid.” But I remember that starting this year I was called much worse. Fag and bitch were used a lot. We had a computer at home with internet access that I used to play games like Club Penguin after school, so I looked up the meaning of the words and that’s how I vaguely knew what gay people were. I didn’t want to be called a gay person because I started to pick up on students and faculty having conversations about how gay people were gross. So I got a “girlfriend.” She was one of the only asian kids in school and I thought she was pretty so I asked her to date. Our dating consisted of sitting at the same table at lunch, but the title that we were together was known among kids in my grade. She was bossy but that was still better than a bully so I enjoyed her company. The bullying that I got started to be veered towards her as well, so we stopped hanging out around 5th grade. Of course, the name calling was back in full force once our relationship was over, but I think this may have been when I began to become desensitized to it all and I stopped crying every day. I also stopped seeing the child therapist because my parents thought it was unnecessary because I wasn’t crying as often. 6th Grade - This was the last year of elementary school for me. Things were a lot different because now my grade had the power of being the oldest kids on the campus. Groups that reflected stereotypical high school cliques were formed around this time, and drama came with that. I was a teacher’s helper that year, which just meant that I filed class papers during recess as an excuse to stay inside (of course I was the only boy doing it while all the other boys were playing outside so I got bullied for that.) There were other teacher’s helpers, but they were popular girls who wanted nothing more than to kiss the teacher’s ass, so they would often sabotage my work behind the teacher’s back. Needless to say, I was done with everyone at that school. For about a year or so, I had been playing Minecraft after school and had even made a small group of friends online who were my age (surprisingly they were actual kids my age and not adults pretending to be kids) and we conversed over Skype often because we were from different schools in the same district. The junior high I’d be going to was where I’d start attending classes with those online friends. 6th Grade Camp - This is probably one of the defining moments of my childhood that I’d call traumatic. As an end-of-elementary school event, the teachers asked parents to raise money to send the kids on a camping trip before winter break. The parents raised enough money so we all got to go. It was my first time outside of town ever since the move after kindergarten and I was alone so I was already very scared. We arrived at camp and the cabin me and 10 or so other boys and a counselor were staying in was far away so we hiked there with our stuff. The teachers lived in cabins with a TV, air conditioning, etc. that was far away from our section of the camp, which was old cabins. We had moved in and everything, and the day went on as normal. The first night, we all sat down with the counselor on a rug in our cabin. Our counselor, for context, was just a horny 17 year old who was only really there to hit on female counselors, so our safety wasn’t much of a priority. He told us that we’d be paired into buddy groups with whoever was our bunkmate, and if we needed to use the bathroom, we would walk them up, grab a flashlight and whistle, and leave to walk the distance to the communal bathroom. My bunkmate happened to be one of the popular boys that really liked to bully me. In fact, the other 9 boys besides me had all bullied me at some point. When we were getting into our sleeping bags, I wasn’t feeling well (my stomach was hurting because camp food and a different climate) so I stayed in the cabin while everyone else was very obnoxious in the cabin. This already made me want to cry but I had to convince myself to stay strong. So the night went on, it’s much later now because everyone has been asleep for a while. I’d been up the whole time with a horrible stomachache and I waited until I knew I was going to throw up soon to notify my bunkmate that I needed to use the bathroom. I had to convince him to get out of bed so we could go. Eventually he agreed and we walked down the trail to the bathroom (we needed flashlights for the way back because the cabins had no lights while the bathroom did, and there were animals and cliffs around so we needed a whistle.) We got there and I asked him to wait outside while I went in and threw up (I cry when I throw up because of the pain, but I didn’t want him to hear me crying so I suffered through it.) I finished up and went outside, only to see that he was gone. I freaked out at first and nobody was around so I cried. I was out there for an hour or so before I realized that nobody was gonna come save me, so I tried to retrace my steps back to the cabin without the whistle or flashlight. I made it back eventually, just to see him sleeping in his bunk. I was too scared to wake everyone up by yelling at him so I just went to sleep whimpering. That was the worst part of camp, but there were other things, like being pushed into rocks or being forced to be the one in our group to point out to a counselor that we found a condom by a tree. Long story short, I think it was one of the main contributors to my trust issues now. 7th Grade - This year, like all the others, had issues, but I’d say that I was not bullied as much this year as all the others before. I went into school with friends for the first time, since my online friends and I now went to the same school. I had an actual P.E. class for the first time (the district didn’t have enough funding to start focusing enough on physical education for anyone under 7th grade.) Having P.E. meant locker rooms, which were new for me. When I’d be changing into gym clothes I’d look over at my locker neighbor all the time. I started noticing this and that’s when I found out that I was gay. That boy had been my first real crush. The homophobia from elementary school was still just as present in junior high so I stayed silent because I didn’t want to get beat up. It was very difficult because I was going through puberty at the time while simultaneously suppressing all sexual feelings. There was another camp event that everyone was required to attend, and it went similarly to 6th Grade, with me being in a cabin with previous bullies my age, except this time getting out of the shower naked was seen as common. I had to suppress myself so much that I think it molded me into who I am now. I see other gay people more than happy to be out and flaunting their sexuality, and I prefer to keep it hidden, even now. 8th Grade - Shit hits the fan starting now. My year started with me telling my old locker neighbor about my feelings, which went about as horrible as possible. He rejected me, refused to speak to me again, told all his friends who told their friends, word got around among a large portion of the student body, and I was bullied wherever I went, on and off campus. One of the reasons why I gained the confidence to tell my feelings was because everyone was saying that they accept gay people (this was when PC culture was starting to integrate into where I lived.) I was hoping that, even if people knew, they wouldn’t care now. I was very wrong. This was the nail in the coffin for any chance of me ever staying friends with anyone I grew up with. They had made me an isolated loner, called me names, beat me up, traumatized me, but this was the final straw. Even to this day I refuse to speak to anyone I went to school with; I see their social media often and I’m reminded that people can change what they say they believe in, but prejudice doesn’t go away. This, already, had solidified my mental state to be on a default of depressed, but with a good facade to just show that I’m feeling fine, because of all the hiding I had done from my parents. The time before winter break that year was one of the lowest points I’ve been in. I was in band and sat next to a female friend from the online group. I was still hanging out with them; even though they made jokes that were often directed towards me and made me want to cry, I stayed with them to have the feeling of belonging somewhere because cliques were much more exclusive now. The female friend liked to hit me for fun every time we were in class, and though it always hurt, I never spoke up because she wouldn’t have gotten in trouble, seeing how she’s a girl and I’m a boy and I was expected to not have emotional problems. But one day, she hit me with a band case (with an instrument inside it) and I broke. I slapped her (I hadn’t fought back with fists since 1st grade) and everything went to shit. She made a big deal out of it, cursing me out, pointing out what I did to everyone, and storming out of the room with crocodile tears. I was in shock, and then I freaked out because suddenly a room of people were cursing at me, calling me an abuser, misogynistic piece of shit, a waste of space, a lowlife, etc. I tried to hope that things would be fine and everything would blow over, but it didn’t. I went home and checked our group chat only to be met with death threats from everyone in my friend group, her little brother on her account calling me things that I’ll refrain from saying because they pretty much hate on every aspect of who I am, including family history and illnesses. Needless to say, the bullying continued in full force at school and home online for a couple weeks before I started crying again, this time in my room because I stayed bottled up all day at school. My parents noticed and put me back in therapy with the therapist from a few years back. I was old enough to notice her incompetence in not letting me (now a 13 year old) have a conversation with her without my parents at my side. So at this point I was being attacked on all sides. I was suicidal and my parents keep taking me to her even though nothing was coming of it besides being interrogated by her and I’d be clinging to my bed to try and not be pulled off and taken there. I eventually told them about confidentiality and they took me to another few therapists. That was a weight off my shoulder and allowed me to bounce back from suicidal tendencies. The school year ended, and I enrolled at a private high school afterwards. 9th-12th - For context I just graduated from being a senior. The high school I went to didn’t have much bullying because we were monitored more, as it was a private high school. I still didn’t have any friends, up until now. The only real challenge I faced from high school was late nights of homework and finding the motivation to work as a whole. The after-events of 8th grade followed me throughout high school. My therapist diagnosed me with moderate to clinical depression and social anxiety while I was I high school. I was (and still am) closeted throughout high school, so my repression never really went away. And now here I am. I’ve been out of high school for a couple months, and I’ve been at home. I’ve done a lot of thinking over the summer. My childhood was horrible, I don’t doubt that anymore. Social media really gave me a chance to reflect on how different I am. The only people I could relate to out of everyone I had heard about on the news and over media over the summer were the mass shooters. I don’t know if what I feel for them is sympathy, but I certainly could’ve been one, with what I had gone through. Had I not found escape outlets like YouTube soon enough (before it was hyper-monitored), or had I had an access to firearms or other weapons, I could’ve easily seen myself walking into my school or somewhere else, ready to cause destruction. I’m different now, but the part of myself from a few years ago relates to them. As my one outlet for frustration, the Internet, becomes more policed and everyone gets angrier and more reluctant to be a force to help humanity, I find myself losing any hope I had in humanity (which wasn’t much to begin with.) Every day I find myself feeling worse. As of a few weeks ago I’d consider myself suicidal again, or at least to have on and off periods of suicidal tendencies. Nobody in my life knows, they all think I’m doing fine and thinking about college. But it’s not true. There are still things I like about life, like pets and nature, but the possibility I’ll get to have a happy ending to my life are getting slimmer and slimmer. I just wonder whether it’s worth it anymore. 14 of the 18 years of my life, from the start of my education, had always left me feeling like I needed to hold out, to see the better things on the horizon. But I’m at the horizon now, and things are bleak.",

2174,"Not suicidal but no reason to liveI don't know what it is about me, but I just don't care to live my life. I'm 17 and my life is fine.

I have one year of high school left and afterwards, I don't see any happiness forthcoming. I don't want to go through a whole lifetime's worth of studying/working and then eventually dying slowly and probably painfully. I just feel that if I ended it now it would be easier then sinking into a depressed state later on. When I go to sleep I hope that I don't wake up. I don't think I could ever kill myself forcefully by my own hand, but I'm always hoping for something else to kill me, like a drunk driver hitting me while I'm on a walk or something. I don't know if I'm depressed, but all I know is that I don't have true happiness anymore. I'll have moments, mainly with my parents or siblings, but in general, I'm not happy.

Buy a plant that’s already growing so it’s less easy to kill. Buy a pothos they’re very hardy. Sometimes you need to give yourself a reason to live. If I didn’t have my fish I probably would sleep everyday away but I have to get up and feed him and turn on his lights for the day and turn them off at night and clean his tank every week or two. If you’re already relatively high functioning/ have a daily routine it can be good to know that there is a living thing that depends on you for life and depends on you to be there for it.",

2178,"I feel like I have no reason to live.All things considered, I've had a really good life. I was born and raised by two parents who loved me very much in an upper middle class home. But around 2014, everything started to fall apart, although not nearly in as bad of a way that other people would consider to be really awful. My dreams fell apart, circumstances drifted me and my friends away from each other, and my greatest passion in life, coming up with my own stories in my head, sort of left me (in the sense that anytime I tried to get lost in my own ideas it felt very shallow and superficial). I was, and still am, very alone. I considered and attempted suicide many times simply because it felt like I had nothing in life that made it meaningful, like I was watching life through a window rather than experiencing it. I became frustrated and my thoughts looped over and over in my head. I like to believe that I've gotten better, but honestly, nothing has changed. I have nothing giving me purpose. I feel like I survive, but not really live. It's to the point where I am continuing to consider suicide as an option to finally be at peace with my endless circling misery, were it not for the oblique fear of hell and for the fact that I can't get ahold of a weapon. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to live like this forever. I want to really live, not just float around aimlessly. But nothing inspires me or fills me with genuine joy. It's as though forces in the universe conspire to keep me away from anything that really matters. I don't want to just exist. I want to live.",
2179,"Have no reason to liveThis has been building up over the last couple of months, but yesterday was a major point. It feels like there is no one in the world who would ever care if I'm gone. My husband only wants me for sex and cuddly romance. My parents and in laws want me to have a child and maintain their status in society. My friends only need me to do their work and be a reliable +1. Just yesterday there was a dinner which my friends decided without me and pulled me in at the last moment. I probably should have asked them to change the time but it would be of no use because the last few times I asked them to take my concerns into account, they ended up having fun without me. Apparently my in laws found out about me staying out late and decided to call my mom, who then decided to tell me that my friends don't even care for me, as I've always been around for all their weddings and house warming events and parties but none showed up for mine citing various reasons like 'oh it's on a weekend and I have other plans' or 'oh you're far away and I'd have to travel' even tough it doesn't work the same way when I tell the same. I tried to kill myself by taking a knife to my wrist but I got scared of the pain and I just threw it away. I don't know what to do to not keep drifting through life in pain.

Now, when we argue after years of this crap it's like I want him to see that this is what I've been dealing with, this is what you've been ignoring and refused to help me with. I wouldn't do it. The reason why I'm still breathing today is for our son and I will never leave him. Edit: I feel like I need to mention that I do have professional help and I take about five medications a day and I go to therapy once a week. I've had these issues all my life, unfortunately borderline personality disorder is not a illness treated itself, only the comorbid disorders. Although, this all sounds bad in my post, I am tremendously better than what I used to be. I was in an inpatient hospital for almost a year at 13. I was admitted for agoraphobia, cutting, burning, scratching and carving into myself. The fact that there is just thoughts but not extreme action is the stepping stone to my path of healing.",
2207,"[M4F]29 Let's beat depression (and social anxiety) together!Hi! Let's begin with a the short version of a long story: When I was around 17 I suddenly lost interest in everything and quit high school. I basically lived in my parent's house doing nothing for a couple years until I was offered a job. I worked for a couple more years, then decided to leave the country for awhile for a random reason. I came back in 2008 and then went back to my old job and pretty much old life, up until a few months ago. All during this time I basically isolated myself and had a difficult time just surviving every day. Due to an event that would have traumatized anyone, I fell down into the abyss. I had lost the will to live and seriously considered killing myself. Realizing this probably wasn't good, I called a behavioral health center and made an appointment. They informed me that I had major depressive disorder, and based on my history it probably started way back in high school. Since nobody including myself ever really thought of seeking treatment (my parent's thought I was just mellow and I thought adult life was just really hard). Fast forward to today. I'm on medication that has had a profound effect on me. I want to get better. I want to have a life where I look forward to the future. Though my mood and general outlook have improved considerably, I found that (apparently) if you isolate yourself for most of your adult life you don't develop very good social skills (totally not obvious right?). This is problematic since the one objective reason for my depression is my lack of meaningful contact with women (never had a girlfriend blah blah you guys probably get it). I have tried to get something started a couple times, but I'm an honest person and it always gets out that I was emotionally dead for over a decade and have no social skills and still don't enjoy most activities and generally act odd and blah blah blah negative self deprecation rearing its ugly head as usual. Anyway, I came up with the genius idea that if I found a girl/woman/female (what is the most respectful term?) with the similar issues, I might be able to connect with them better, and even maybe we could help each other. Okay I know you're thinking ""Everybody has that same idea it isn't original and <insert possibility of success>"". Giving up before I try something was the old me. Now even though I'll probably fail (yay negative thinking), at least I'm moving forward (sort of). It doesn't even really have to be a romantic relationship (although that'd be nice). Best thing is, because I once wanted to kill myself and have lived a life of constant emotional pain, I don't get upset very easily (I get truly angry maybe once every other year). So as long as you keep talking, no matter what you say, there is almost NO way you can A) Weird me out, B) Offend me, C)Make me judge you. So if you're looking for the person who might be immune to whatever reasons you think nobody will ever accept you for, try me out! Now I do have to include a disclaimer that I am still technically depressed, so when my medication isn't effecting me (it occasionally doesn't work for some reason) I might not be as chipper as I am now (so I might start talking about nothing but negative things and think everything is hopeless and nobody will accept me anyway blah blah depressed blah). Shoot me a message! Operators are standing by! (Well at least one of them :D) for the tl;dr version just read the post title :P (The above post was written but not read over and edited because I have a problem with perfectionism that prevents me from actually doing things)",
2211,"I'm really at the edge of killing myself now...I'm overwhelmed with problems, life, stress, depression. I've been friendless for 9 years. For those 9 years I've been keeping this from everyone I dreamt that I was left behind 3 times... These demons are about to completely have me My mom doesnt care about me anymore My family are cold towards me they dont really care too My dad is about to kick me out because I dont communicate or act like a normal human being My brother hates me Every time I want to fit in and try, i end up alone I'm 20 years old, I've failed graduating for quite some time. I see no future for me Today, when i went to the store I didnt know our town sold coals and coal starters. When i saw the coal and the coal starters laying about. Immediately i thought about it, me killing myself with it. My suicidal thought. I know how to end my life now. Insulate my room, take heavy sleeping pills, burn coals onto a pan and sleep and die. I will die in my room I'm always blamed, mocked, treated unfairly by people I'm a problem so I'm doing them a favor So be it I fought two times, I wanted to be on that good path two times. I failed. I failed God and I failed in life. This is the first time I'm letting this out. Sure ignore it.",
2212,"After 10 years of ineffective self-improvement, 3 years of being suicidal, and only days before I was planning on killing myself, I have finally managed to get a girl to go on a second date with me.From a very young age, I could always tell that I had an unattractive face, but kept myself sane and hopeful by listening to all the platitudes society shoved down my throat, like I'm sure many of you have. For others, the most important thing in life is family, or friends, or money, or status; for me, it is romantic love. So for 13-year old me, those two facts led to a decade of attempting to improve myself to one day become attractive to someone. I forced myself to become more social, worked on my style, hygiene, started playing basketball seriously, working out, picking up guitar and other hobbies, buying status symbols in clothes, accessories, electronics, cars. I even managed to join a fraternity in college. It was only in my 2nd year of college, after seeing all my friends, fraternity brothers, and classmates hooking up & dating while I was as much of a romantic failure as ever, did I realize all that was bullshit. I realized that no matter how good of a partner you may be on the inside, it all was for nought if you had an unattractive face, even if you have a good body like I do. Cue a very long 3-4 years of being suicidally depressed, intimately deprived, and hopeless. I had a few first dates, maybe once per year, but I was always rejected when asking for a second date. Each rejection weighed on me more and more, and eventually I lost what tiny sliver of hope I had. A few months ago began probably my worst depressive episode. I had planned to kill myself sometime mid-January, and had gathered all the supplies I needed to do it. Literally days before I planned to kill myself, I matched with a really cute girl on Tinder and we hit it off. Two weeks later, we went on our first date and it was easily the best date I've ever been on. I've learned a lot about her and I genuinely really like her. At the end of the date, I kissed her goodbye and asked her out for a 2nd date this weekend, which she enthusiastically agreed to. She even came up with an idea and a plan, which pleasantly shocked me. It feels as if a miracle has happened to me. For the first time in a long while, I have feelings of hope and excitement for the future. I'm still wary because I've gotten my hopes up only to be sorely disappointed in the past, and if this doesn't work out I will certainly end my life. But nonetheless, I can see a light at the end of the tunnel. I hope all of you find similar miracles in your lives. EDIT: Thank you all for the kind words. The second date went even better than the first and I am in the happiest mood I have been in years. I think this might finally be it.",
2213,I suffer from depression and after a painful breakup in 2018 I decided to monitor how many times a day I thought killing myself for a year. This chart shows when I finally decided to go to therapy and quit suffering. [OC],
2214,I don't know what to do I don't feel like killing myself but sometimes it just feels like it's the best optionAt all times I'm either too unmotivated or sad to get out of bed and put any effort into anything or I'm hiding what I'm feeling to my friends and family. I don't think I have done anything wrong but it always seems like everything good that happens to me is a lie. It's getting to the stage where my friends are getting more and more depressed as they hang around me and they are acting more like therapists than friends making sure I don't just kill myself at every moment. I don't even think my friends want to be my friends and instead just this guilt they feel if they stop. At this point don't know if I really want to keep going through like this.,

Now I feel very silly like some emo kid. I am sorry. It was interesting experience. Now I understand that my death has as a little sense as my life. Zero to be precise. Nobody really cares, and I was like seconds away from nice statistics of modern male suicides. Everything I feel now is hatred. So I guess I am not very suitable for this sub anymore.",

(though, they obviously didn’t work.) third times a charm, right? EDIT: i wish i could say that my mental health is the only thing bringing me down. im tired of living in a world where i was sexually assaulted, i’m tired of being abused, i’m tired of having fear of seeing my father and his family. i don’t want pity, i really am just tired. i’m scared of myself and the future",

I’m in grad school and my depression is crippling me to get anything done. I know I’m smart but I lack will and motivation and feel really sad most of the time. I’ve wasted most of my life away just laying in bed and crying and feeling bad. I live in a horrible country and my way out was doing a PhD in a modern country, but I can’t. I’m not good enough, my resume sucks and I really cannot live with the disappointment. I don’t want to live in this dictatorship I really don’t. My friends don’t care about me, my family doesn’t either so probably my parents will have a fight over whose fault it is that I’m dead and they’ll move on so I won’t be missed.

I chose biology simply because I sucked at math. The past 6 months have been incredibly stressful and it's only getting worse. And today, I was thinking of killing myself during biology class. I tried to list every possible way in my head, and I decided that the easiest was an overdose of some meds or whatever. I thought i was getting dumber and I will never be able to live up to my full potential ever again and I couldn't stand seeing myself half-assing everything. Before I left class, some friend talked to me(she didn't know what I was planning to do when I get home) and I said to myself, I will just try one more time with life and if it fails, then that's that. Later today, before going to bed, my brother asked me for some help with his math, and it took me less than 5 minutes of thinking to get the idea behind the problem even though I haven't seen maths stuff in almost a year! I don't know but I am so happy at the moment! And I am proud of myself! Edit: Thank you all for the encouragement! I kinda wish I could get help but it's difficult where I am!",
2224,"My bio 117 lab TA is so rude she literally makes me think about killing myselfI cry every week before class and after class because of how rude and demeaning she is. And it’s only been 2 classes. Can the bio department PLEASE begin posting a list of TAs teaching workshop and lab starting next semester? Some TAs are extremely respectful and actually help students learn and it shouldn’t be left to a matter of luck (since labs and workshop begin only after add/drop week). Others make it a point to emphasize how much harder their life is and how dumb undergrads are. In this case, very little time goes into teaching and more time is spent blaming the students. I get it, you’re in grad school and also probably crumbling under the pressure but abusing your power over your students is not a healthy way to relieve your stress. Undergrads are extremely stressed out as well and it won’t hurt to be a little empathetic and kind to your students. I don’t expect to be greeted with a smile and sit and talk about our feelings at the beginning of every class, but a little patience and understanding that this is our first time learning NEW material will go a long way. We’re also trying to get by and do our best, trust me I have no intentions to make your life harder or more stressful. I genuinely don’t know how to better my situation. It’s too late to switch sections and I don’t want to get into any beef with the biology department by reporting to a higher authority.",
2225,"(SPOILERS) A thank you to the writers of halfway down (you helped to stop me from killing myself)(SPOILERS FOR THE LAST EPISODES OF BOJACK HORSEMAN) The halfway down episode hit me as hard as it possibly could. Originally, I thought Bojack was going to drown. I was glad I was right. I usually don’t predict these things accurately. Some context, earlier that day my suicidal thoughts got the best of me, and I was sent home from my job because I was having a panic attack. I fantasized about cars hitting me and I was tired of my life. I got home. I remembered the Bojack finale was up. I saw Bojack dying and initially was mad he didn’t stay dead. He wouldn’t have to hurt anymore! But then my boyfriend pointed to the halfway down poem, and how scared Secretariat was in his final moment of existence. Bojack didn’t die and it wasn’t poetic, it was LUCKY. Dying shouldn’t be romanticized and wished for. No one really knows if anything comes after. Your last moment shouldn’t be a one of self-inflicted fear when we have so little time in the first place. I’m not going to wish to jump or get hit by a car ever again because this cartoon about a talking horse got through to me about how terrible the view from halfway down is, and how the last thing you should do is go there simply because you want things to be easier. Things won’t be easier. There might not be any of you left to even tell. (Also yes, I have a therapist and I plan on talking to him about my thoughts and the panic attack. I am going to be okay.) So whoever had input on how that part of the finale was written, thank you for helping me. Edit: thank you for the award!",
2226,"For real Eminem has stopped me from killing myself several timesI love him so much. I can’t believe high school kids and college kids don’t listen to him as much anymore. His depth, ability to communicate his pain and relate to the self hate is at a genius level. I think it’s so bad ass to see him get so much respect. Certainly not a guest in the house of hip hop. People don’t see him as a role model but he’s a fantastic role model as far as how to try to think and have a work ethic of never giving up. I love him so much. I am definitely a Stan over here. I always try to be my edition of Eminem in my life. His passion, heart and soul is unmatched. The new album is ridiculously sick I’ve already listened to the whole thing 5 times. It’s such heat.

But just now, I was trying to sleep and I tried to ""peek into the future"" and still see me ending my life.

If I come out, my family will disown me and I'll be on my own and alone. I have talked to some people on the internet and they just say stay celibate. Honestly it seems unfair how I can't experience love with someone so I don't want to stay celibate. So I hope something kills me, tried it a couple times crossing the road for the lorry to hit me, but some people manage to ""save me"", not to say I'm ungrateful, I just don't want to continue living if it's going to be like this. Add the amount of anxiety if people find out and the depressed thoughts that come after it is just tiring. My parents won't understand because even though they said they went through depression, they just say to me that's it's all in my head that I'm sad. I'm having an inkling that my mom know since I remember telling my mom I searched hot men and what not on the internet when I was twelve. Dont know why I told her but I did.

Last October we cut our ties after another major fight so my reason for not killing myself wasn't there any more. I started to make plans to end my life. I quit my job and tried to tie lose ends so i would leave as little of a mess when i would be gone. The day before the day i planned to kill myself a friend who lives in an other country messaged me out of the blue asking how i was doing. Since i knew she had her own struggles with depression i figured i could tell her what i was planning. She decided to help me by informing a friend via facebook and this friend immediately came over to give me a hug and talk with me. I completely broke, started crying my eyes out and opened up to him. He's been my best friend for about 15 years and he knew i was depressed but he did not know i had concrete plans to step out before that moment. Thanks to these two good people i took the first step by going to my doctor with my depression and suicidal tendencies. I'm on meds now and i have my first appointment with a psychologist in 12 days. I'm not saying i'm good now, just that i took a step on the path to getting better. Hopefully i can stay on that path. For now i'm just taking it one day at a time.",

I haven't felt anything genuine for over 3 years and I don't know when this hellsih cycle of shit will end. I can't remember why I actually want to kill myself, at this point in time atleast the least I can feel is sadness right??? Well no, nothing. It's actually annoying. Anyways I'm going to play minecraft with my little brother alot tomorrow and buy him stuff and what not. Love ya'll and goodbye. EDIT: I'm not doing it again! I'm pushing my date further up, HUGE thanks to everyone that helped me get out of this state of mind. Even if I don't know any of you guys, you are wonderful people and deserve much better than the negatives we carry with us. Thank you all once again.",
2251,I wish I could die without killing myselfLike I wish i could just get into an accident and die then that way I wouldn’t have to do it myself. Idk it’s fucked up to think that but I think about it all the time,
2254,I’m killing myself tonightIt’s really too much to go in detail to. But it’s really correlated to all the things on my account about my suicidal ideas. My parents managed to get me 2 therapists yet I can’t fucking feel an inch well. I’m doing nothing but hurting them. I’m sorry for everyone I disappointed I just wanted to say goodbye to everybody on this sub who helped me when I wasnt well,
2255,"The only thing keeping me from killing myself is my wife and daughter. I am beginning to resent them for it.I've talked to two therapist. They both encourage me to get a divorce (after a LOT of therapy). The issue is, I really think I can't handle the stress of a divorce. I love my daughter very much, and I want to see her grow up. However, I feel like a fucking robot that can't make anyone happy. I work harder and people ask for more of me. Both my parents have died in the past year and my last words to both were ""fuck you"" (one deservedly, one not so much). I came from very humble beginnings and worked myself into management and after my dad died my work went to shit and I am getting canned. I just don't want to do any of this anymore, but I do becauee I have to. Not sure what I need or if I need anything from here, but it feels better to type it. 8 times I have had serious thoughts about suicide this year, everytime I think of my daughter and realize I can't. The only thingnthatbreally help is smoking shittons of weed which, of course, leaves my wife dissappointed in me (I have been approved by a physician and live in an legal state. My younger brother is in jail and the whole system isndesigned tontake money from families and with me losing my job, it is expenaive to even talk to him. Our world is cruel and I don't want to live in it. I spent 10 years in the Army and did 3 tours in a Combat Arms job. I've earned real medals (bronze star with a V, ARCOM with a V) for actions in combat. No one gives a shit. No one cutsbyou any slack for killing for college money. For digging up IEDs for a poverty wage. For losing friends. And all I am is a disposable piece in this machine, school, work, the government, family. It's all just people in a line waiting for their piece of me.All this world and the people in it want is to take. I have nothing left to give. I am dead inside. I'll wake up and do it again tomorrow. I will wake up, get the babybready while my wife takes a shower. Drop off the baby. And gontrain my replacement and apply for jobs that will reject my resume. I'll home and work on my MBA homework so I can go hate my life for hopefully more money down the road. Fuck this all.",
2259,"After killing myself, I was initially relieved that God allowed me to check on my wife and children.But only in the moments they cried for me.",
2260,"I can’t stop thinking about killing myselfI’m trapped. No matter how hard I try, I can’t see any other conclusion than me no longer existing. My family loves me and there are no issues in that relationship which causes me to think the way I do. My problems are solely my own. There’s so much I could say, but the long and the short of it is that I’m extremely lonely. I have no friends, and it’s not for a lack of wanting friends. More than anything, I would love to have friends. I’ve also never been in relationship before. And the reason for both of these is that I struggle with social anxiety. But beyond that, I think after years of dealing with social awkwardness, I’ve come to some sort of conclusion that I might fall somewhere on the autistic spectrum, particularly Aspergers Syndrome. I’ve never been diagnosed and that’s part of the problem because I just simply don’t know. But I strongly suspect that this is what I’ve been dealing with all these many years (I’m 25 years old). And it just sucks. I don’t know how to approach anyone in my life to let them know how I’m feeling and what I’m potentially dealing with. So instead I just cram it down inside and feel a little bit more inferior each day. I’m at the point where, more often than not, I want to die. At least then I wouldn’t have to be so confused all the time. I don’t feel smart. I mean, I know I am book smart (not to brag or anything). But it’s like there’s a fogginess that shrouds any kind of clarity. I really have to work at thinking and it’s exhausting. There are times I get lost in conversation because I’m not tracking the conversation well enough and processing what’s being said fast enough. And this also contributes, I think, to my social awkwardness because I shy away from those interactions for a fear of looking stupid, embarrassing myself, and being rejected by the other person. Most of my conversations consist of head nodding and generally agreeing with the other person by saying “Yeah” or “Sure,” or some other monosyllabic word that doesn’t require an exertion of too much thinking that might cause you to stumble over your words and get lost in the middle of a conversation. You wanna talk about feeling stupid and inferior, that’s it. What everyone else does with ease is instead such a chore of mental exertion for you. It really makes you feel alienated from others and, to be frank, like you’re some kind of aberration. That’s how I generally feel: like a screw up, a mistake. Like I shouldn’t exist because I wasn’t designed to operate in a world of social animals. What I don’t get is, why am I even sharing this? No one in my life cares, so why should you? I guess that another thing that upsets me. No one in my life noticed that I was struggling or hurting, and they still don’t. It’s like, ‘Does anyone care about me?’ How can they not see the pain? That’s what hurts the most, I guess. Having had to deal with this on my own for basically my whole life and not having a single person to notice I was not doing so well. Not having a single person ask, “Are you okay?” Not one so-called Christian to use their “spiritual discernment” to have the sensibility to offer even one helpful prayer. Just one. Not a single one. (I’m not being hyperbolic either.) While I used to love Jesus, I don’t think I do anymore. Why? Because I don’t believe he cares about me. Yeah, yeah, I know, “Cast your cares on Jesus for he cares for you” blah, blah, blah. Maybe if I’d seen a single shred of caring in action in my life, I might believe that. But I’m too jaded. My heart is hard. And I’m at the threshold of losing hope after years of trying to hold onto it. If there is anything that remains of my faith, it’s a smoldering ember buried beneath a pile of regretful ashes and burned out coals of failure—soon to go out. What’s the point of living if all you’re gonna experience for your entire life is the hurt of loneliness? No friends. No girlfriend. And certainly not a wife. That’s no life, and “life more abundant.” That’s misery. This was way too long. I’m sorry.",

No matter the severity of any obstacles today, I didn’t think, “If I were just dead...”.

Thank you, each and every one of you for your thoughtful replies. I love each and everyone of you. And for the three people who rewarded this - thank you as well. Y’all rock! As an update, today I went to see the mental health resource lady at my college. Guess who’s going to see a psychiatrist soon? I feel like a giant weight has been lifted off of my shoulders. I made that first step towards getting better for sure now. I’m so extremely proud of myself. Yesterday was a good day. Today was a great day. Tomorrow will be a fantastic day. And every following day will be better than the previous.",
2263,"TIFU By Accidentally Blowing up a Power Supply and Almost Killing MyselfObligatory this happened two days ago and not today. Anyway, I was building a computer I intended to use for a home media server, and for whatever reason, I simply could not get any video output to a monitor. I would press the power button, hear the fans spin up, and yet, nothing. Upon closer inspection, I noticed that there was a red switch on the power supply labelled ""130"", now keep in mind that where I live the outlets typically output 240v at 50hz. I thought ""why not, it's worth a try"", so I flicked the switch, grabbed the power cord, and went to plug it in. The second the insides of the cord made contact with the pins on the power supply, an extremely bright barrage of sparks flew out of the power supply, as well as making an enormous 'bang' sound. I instantly yelled, flew backwards, and tried to figure out what had happened. The entire ordeal completely totalled the power supply, as several of the capacitors inside of it were completely burnt, and bent. I also have two large dark marks on my right arm, that hurt quite a bit. Now the entire PC smells like smoke and I'm pretty sure I can never trust myself around electronics again. TL;DR: Flicked the wrong switch on a power supply that set it to use a different voltage, PC blew up and left a mark on my arm.",
2264,It's been a couple of months since I was thinking of seriously killing myself. I'm still here.I was reading a subreddit where someone was saying it had been six months since they'd not thought of or tried of killing themselves. I trying not to cry. The last time was in November. I woke up & I couldn't see. I panicked. I work as a graphic designer. Losing my sight meant losing everything. I got taken to an ER by the police. My eyes are on the mend - it most likely will take months for them to completely heal. Lasting emotional scars from the experience have begun to show ... They won't likely lead to sucide. I can't wait for six months. Edit: the day before yesterday I had a bad day. Yesterday had a worse day. Thought of killing myself again ... I just did it again just now. Edit: the days of me being ok are over. I'm thinking I should kill myself tonight or tomorrow.,

Having serious dark thoughts.https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/enl970/comment/fe5cx4z?context=3 TLDR; theres I (21F 2nd gen American of Pashtun decent who is over 20 weeks pregnant, from super chill liberal fam) and husband (29M 1st gen of Pakistani decent, love marriage, both agnostics) and then there’s my fake ass MIL (idk, like 70? Idfk why she even has so much energy) who’s nice as long as you listen to her is bestowing and forcing a second huge wedding here in the states after doing four days in Pakistan in August despite my families wishes they will not contribute or want this event happening to impress her friends. Well it’s happening and is entirely booked. She got cuckold FIL to pay for all of it. Now my parents are coming and involved, so yes we’re basically doing a 2nd Baraat. I will be 23 weeks pregnant at this time. I absolutely hate these types of Pakistani people she’s friends with too- and my husband has decided to invite every douchebag kid imaginable he grew up with (typical desi dudes from NYC, they have drug problems and all cheat on their wives who are their 1st cousins also 9/10 times) and I, with no friends, no support system, just some small family- am having serious dark thoughts.

THEY WILL ATTACK YOU THE SECOND THEY GET!** I have money to leave I’m financially secure but I’d trade every dollar for a good support system or friend. Man this is fucking sick and not right to do.

2276,"My life is finally headed in the right direction after almost killing myself 5 years ago.I attempted suicide multiple times as a teen, and I had diagnosed depression since the ripe old age of 10. My adolescence was a clusterfuck, and my late teen years were almost as bad. Suicide was always heavy on my mind as some sort of twisted backup plan. I can vividly remember thinking to myself at age 18, “if it’s not better in 5 years then I’ll end it. Just give it 5 years. You can do it.” I am almost 24, and I was notified by my employer today that I’d be receiving my second promotion within a year, and that he was absolutely moved and inspired by my interview. During my fifth year, I lost 65 lbs, started a new job that I love, got promoted at the same job twice with a generous pay raise, reconciled with my partner of 6 years, ended toxic family relationships, bought a car, and raised my credit score from 350 to 600. My life isn’t perfect, but it’s goddamn fabulous. I’m glad I kept the promise to myself so last these few years, because the payoff has been incredible. Here’s to Year 5. Happy to be here.",

So what I'm trying to say is, why should I wait for death? When I can execute myself and choose my own death, before universe bringing it to me. Until now I experienced pretty heavy shit. What if my death would be so gruesome too? I highly doubt that we will perish away when we die. I am sure there will be something else but I highly doubt it would be pleasurable.

I am about to drop out of university for the second time in my life, I have lost my income, I am soon two months behind on rent. I am sick of constantly trying and trying and always, ALWAYS failing. I have literally not achieved anything since 2011. Depressed for around 15 years by this point, I just see absolutely no way out of this. I will always be depressed and miserable, no matter what happens. Sure, my life has had happier and better moments in it, but they do not make up for all the misery in between those times. Life, to me, just objectively seems to not be worth living. &#x200B; I'm not sure why I wrote this incoherent mess. I'm not looking for help, I'm probably not even willing to accept any more of it at this point. So yeah. See you in hell, everyone. &#x200B; EDIT: Oh yeah maybe I should add that I have tried to get help.

2282,"Killing myself and seemingly okay with itTotally fucked. I'm 34 and have been drinking for a good 10 years. Used to be smaller amounts (two tall boys), but has gradually increased because a few beers does nothing for me. I can tell at this point my tolerance is through the roof. I think I hit a new low on Friday night. Bought a 24 pack and finished 17 beers. Last night I had about 13 beers with 4-5 shots chugged from the bottle. I average anywhere from 8-12 beers a night, every single night including weekdays. Sometimes I may take a night off, but I'm drinking more often than not. I do not day drink, but I drink after 5pm sometimes leading up until 4am in the morning or until I pass out if it's the weekend. To make things worse, I have polysystic kidney disease which is terrifying to me and I'm sure that is an underlying factor because I often think to myself ""better have fun before the shit hits the fan"". Otherwise, I'm pretty normal. I'm in okay shape, I'm 6'0''-- about 190lbs. I hold a steady job and haven't missed more than a day or two in the last year. My mom passed away in 2014 and I moved in with my dad to help him out after he had a stroke. He's 81 years old. I'm trying to do what I can though and I'm strong for him and do a lot (prescriptions, errands, groceries, appointments). I just know I'm absolutely destroying myself with this shit and every time I try to take a few days off, it's all fine and well, but then I relapse because every day seems boring, monotonous and cookie cutter. I know that's the wrong mentality because it's my brain fucking with me and my equilibrium and my body's NEED for alcohol places me in a very anxious state during the day and I can't wait to get home to kick back with a few cold beers and play some video games. Half of me wants to start drinking during the day to take the edge off of certain situations but I know that's another downward spiral. I'm just scared of serious withdrawals and I think I'm scared of not being in a haze because I'll see what I've gradually become over the years and all the reality will come crashing down especially in regards to all aspects of health. I've scheduled blood labs and kidney scans this Tuesday. Also going to see a dentist and will undoubtedly have a couple little cavities again because I neglect brushing my teeth every couple days. Just so fucked up.. I guess my rant's over, sorry. Thanks for listening",
2284,I think about killing myself everyday........I have been suffering with depression for the past 4 years( I am 18 now) and everytime I think about killing myself there is always something which prevents it from happening. I tried to come clean to my parents about it and they shrug it off like I am using it as an excuse for my low marks and my slow anti-social behaviour. I don't want to come clean because people will think I am an attention seeker which I am the complete opposite of. I need someone who can understand what I am feeling and I need advice about how to survive in this world where I kill myself on a daily basis in my mind in different ways.,
2285,"I was released from a mental hospital yesterday and I’m planning on killing myself tonightI was admitted to a mental hospital for being suicidal. Every day when I was getting my medication, they asked me, “Are you having any thoughts of hurting yourself or anyone else?” I always answered no, because I wanted to get out sooner. I was lying. I’m transgender. Millions, if not billions of people hate me by default and would rather I were dead. All I’ve ever wanted is to be a man. No matter how many hormone injections or surgeries I get, I’ll never look quite like a biological man. (Furthermore, I can’t even get on HRT, the one thing that might make me feel a little better, because I’m a minor and my parents are unsupportive.) My body has been disfigured by female puberty and there’s no going back now. No one in my life sees me as a man. If they call me one, it’s because they’re trying to be polite. My mother has made it clear I will always be her little girl; she loves the version of me she’s made up in her head. My friends didn’t care that I was in the hospital. They weren’t worried and they didn’t miss me. Life went on without me. Life will go on without me after tonight. I have not felt true happiness in 4 years and I don’t expect to anytime soon. I have no reason to live. I don’t know why I’m posting this. I guess I just want somebody to finally listen. My friends don’t take me seriously when I say I’m suicidal. I have no idea what to do.

2286,"Activley practicing self care at night instead of thinking about killing myself! :) 💟- I love the sun. It rises and sets and nothing ever stops it. It's reliable. There's this lyric I fell in love with-- ""The sun comes up, like it always does."" No matter what happens, that flaming pile of gas will always come around and go around and come back again like clockwork. - I love tea. I love to sit down with my best friend at that beautiful, elegant and practical wooden table and sip some tea out of beautiful little cups. I love to talk to her. I love the flavor of our conversation and I love the way she makes me feel. - I love my blankie. It's this horrendous yellow color with white polka dots and a burn hole in the corner from where I accidentally got too close to a campfire one night. I've had it since I was a kid because my aunt and mom got it for me. My older brother who I love to death has a matching one in a blue color. - I love my dogs. Mason is this medium sized black mutt we picked up from a shelter eight years ago. He's a beautiful boy and I'm never going to stop loving him. ChunJa, or Springtime in English, is this black toy poodle. Her tail is chopped off and she has a hump back because she came from a puppy mill in South Korea five years ago. I had no idea she was for me. My aunt was supposed to get a pet but she gave her to me. I don't approve of where my little girl came from, but she is a piece of my mother's home that I get to keep in America, and I love her so much. Those two dogs keep me on my toes but I could never have it any other way. - I love to bake. My father's mom always baked for us. I still bake with her, the crappy stuff from grocery stores that has a taste that isn't so good, but I still love it every single time. I love the flavor of the stuff, I love the ritual. I love when you take it out and wait five minutes until it's cooled just a little before taking some. I loved it when my best friend and I baked strawberry muffins together and gave some to our English teacher. - I love the feel when I step into the library. I love the way the books feel in my hand, and I love that my aunt, who has always been in my corner no matter what, works there. I love when I find a new series and a new story to fall into. - I love all my music. There's too much to list but right now I've been listening to lots of Melanie Martinez, half•alive, and twenty øne piløts. Their music saved my life and I'm always going to be grateful for that. X~•~•~X My family loves me. My therapist would care a lot if I died. My teachers would cry when they got the news. My best friend would be grief stricken. The girls I volunteered with at the library, who I grew incredibly close to, would realize in horror how messed up this made them, and they would feel so angry that I would leave them in a state of grief that only time could make feel better. Q and B would feel a horrible emptiness and shock. M, J, I, and D would feel that awful confusion that only comes from knowing a person well enough to be attached but not enough to understand why they cared. The twins would be so fucked up. O would try to console her sister but nothing would work. She would start to cut again. Gav would feel cold and strange and blindsided. The boys I sit with in my construction class would feel a terrible silence hang over them as they do their homework without any kind of help. They would have heard the news but my absence would seal it in for real. Would the people we are building the house for hear the news of my death? For the end-of-year wrap-that-shit-up math project, I am working with my English teacher to build a disc golf course. (Yes, I know how it sounds.) I'm working with four other kids. I'm friendly with my English teacher. What would they do on the job site? All they can do is work. My French teacher would be crushed. He tried so hard and spent so much time making sure I lived. He cares so much. The kids I went to elementary school with would be so upset. My old bully would feel a horrible guilt. My old victim would be so conflicted. My ex friends would feel a tensity in the air. Do they acknowledge it? They abondoned me for my treatment of them. We were close, but we destroyed it. Would the girl who I always helped in English class go home and cry? Or would she just tell it as an awkward story to her mom? Would the boy who I encouraged and taught in math last year even remember who I am? My mom would drop out of college, my brother would cry at night, my sister would cancel her plans and just stare at the wall for hours on end. How would that beautiful boy react? Would he cry or was I just a flirtation? I know he really cares. How would the kid in my French class who talked to me and tried to help me feel? These people hardly treat me like a person sometimes. The boys in math always make fun of my name and call me a hentai bitch (affectionately. Hopefully). My science teacher could give two shits about me. My family is a group of assholes who don't know Jack fucking shit about respect or kindness. I hurt my best friend's feelings recently. I'm awkward around that beautiful boy. Despite that, they would be really fucking broken. I mean something to them and to take that away in such a violent, guilt inducing way is the worst thing I could ever do to them. X~•~•~X I want to go to a university in Canada. I want to lose contact with my dad when I leave. I want to study to become a therapist. I want to date that beautiful boy. From the way things are going, smart money says that'll happen soon. I want to make an appointment with my nurse practitioner and get some more antidepressants. I should have run out a month ago but I forgot and stopped taking them. I want to get married. I want a person who is loving and loud in a mature way with deep seated passions, some hobbies, and an incredible mind. I want to buy a nice house with pink walls and a fish tank. I want to raise a kid. I want to die when I'm one hundred and fifteen sorrounded by people who love me as much as I love them. X~•~•~X I am proud of my capacity to love. I am proud that I can make the people I spend time with realize how much they matter, and I'm proud that I have something in me these amazing people find so good they want to be around me. I am proud that I am fighting my depression and anxiety and body dysmorohic disorder and suicidal ideation. I'm grateful that something in my life happened that set me on a path, off the one that was leading straight to eating disorders. I am proud that people find me interesting and kind and funny and pretty and smart and ""cool"", whatever that means. I don't see what they see, but it makes me feel good that I have most of my bases covered. I like that my hands are naturally smoother than silk and that my skin is naturally acne free, because it means when I get to touch people, I literally feel soft and comforting. I am proud that I always pay attention in class and make it obvious so my teachers know that someone cares. I am proud that there was something about me that was enough for a beautiful, smart, mature, extroverted, nerd who loves the enviornment and hiking to want to befriend. I am proud of my ability to take care of lonely people and make them understand that they matter. I am proud of being an idealist. X~•~•~X If you made it this far, thank you for reading! This is a good coping mechanism I use and I wanted to share a taste with the lovelies of Feemagers because it makes me feel good, and I was thinking that this format might help someone. It helps a lot when I list the things I love and the reasons I love them, the people I have impacted and the way they would react if I died (it really helps me to not want to die. I just don't have the heart to hurt someone like that), my goals and dreams, even if they're outlandish and don't make sense, and the things about me that I like. TL;DR-- practicing self love",
2287,I'm 19 and I was bullied as child now I grown with low self confidence and self hate... I think of killing myself or self harm... and I just can't accept myself ama,
2288,"I'm thinking about killing myself at the momentMy name is Justin and I'm 18, currently at work at the moment and won't be off till 5am so I'm dead tired and out of nowhere I started thinking about slitting my wrist and just ending my shitty life so I wont have to work this shitty job and go home to my shitty family. I already know it seems like attention seeking wich is why I never tell anyone how I feel or what I'm thinking but maybe this can be a start to opening up about my urges.",
2289,"Here's a story I wrote about a time that i was arrested. I started writing 10 yrs ago as a way to pass time and entertain the guys while i was locked up. A decade later i am putting focus into making writing a career so i can quit killing myself in construction. Hope you enjoy. **Trenton, NJ 2011** It had been almost a month since I had reported to my P.O.. There was no doubt in my mind that Mercer County had issued an arrest warrant. I was scheduled to report to the probation office weekly as well as go in front of the judge every Tuesday morning. I had been getting high for months. It started in the halfway house with the intention of quitting before I came home. As assertive and self confident as I am, I always get bullied by drugs and submit to the schedule they want me on. I had been functioning on the brink of destruction for the 2 months that I inhabited this apartment. Each time I met with my P.O. I was carrying a clean urine contraption in my Polo boxers. I’d cut a small slit in the flap of a pair of boxer briefs. Then I would empty out a small bottle of hand sanitizer and fill it with clean piss wherever I could find it. That bottle was then warmed up and placed with just the tip sticking outside the underwear fabric. On my way to the office my body heat would keep the temperature regulated. With this invention I could give the fake sample even if I was being watched and I was always being watched. Most times the officer would stand outside the bathroom and watch as your back was turned but some of the more devious officers would look right at my hammer while I was putting piss in a cup for them. 95% of parole and probation officers are the worst type of people. If you ask me anyone involved in the just system has some lack of self esteem that would drive them to impose there power on others. Especially Richard Dye and Janice Coble two people who did their best to help me ruin my life. At this time I could no longer keep up the façade of a sober productive citizen. I had come to the same crossroads that I had passed through many times before. I could give up the drugs and re-adjust to a healthy wholesome lifestyle, or I could give up the last semblance of a normal life and keep on with the excitement and madness of being a junkie. The junk was way more seductive than the prospect of regularity ever could pretend to be. I waved the white flag at square life and “took it on the run” from probation. For the first few days I talked with criminal advisors of all types. Drug users who had been in the same boat, drug dealers who ran from football numbers for years, and Ex convicts who had long since turned to family men. As I was only facing a 3 year sentence with half that time already served the general consensus was to turn myself in and get this situation behind me. However, I was in the clutch of a daily speedball addiction and I couldn’t find it in me to just walk away from that steamy romance. One day as I was in the midst of a strong dope nod the plan unfurled in front of me. I could collect the security deposit from my apartment, take a train to Florida, and eventually find a job on some sort of Caribbean boat. I would have to stop using but I would work it out so that I started a new life on whatever island felt right. I was so disgusted with my life and the justice system in New Jersey that the fantasy of never coming back to the U.S. filled me with more satisfaction than the best drugs in Kensington. Somedays I still dream of how pleasant a simple life on a small tropical island could be. After the plan was hatched I couldn’t think of anything else. I hadn’t felt the freedom that leaving would give me in years, if ever. I couldn’t leave today because I didn’t yet have the money. I also need to acquire a stash of detox drugs so that I wasn’t diminished to a trembling, crying, puking pile of crumbled junkster on my way to execute operation “Detoxy Freedom”. That meant waiting a few more days if not weeks. My landlord was a clean cut businessman, but was no stranger to the other side of the law. I had explained to him my situation and apologized profusely as I humbly asked for his help by returning my security deposit. With no hesitation he agreed. The catch was that he needed a few days to get it together, whatever that may have meant. In the meantime I needed to make sure I stayed low. I had a buddy who lived a few towns north of Trenton in Pennington. Pennington was a quiet town made up mostly of forest and farmland. It was a great place to hide out. As long as I stayed indoors no one would ever suspect that I was there. I had brought some drugs with me to Pennington but not enough. By my third day there I was in the midst of an ugly withdrawal. My Buddy McFlave knew I was using and showed sympathy but he wasn’t a part of this lifestyle and couldn’t do much to help me out as far as getting another fix. I knew that the only way to end my current physical suffering was to get back down to Trenton and get a fix but I was so close to freedom that I was scared to risk it. That fear only lasted for a day. When McFlave returned home from work one night, I had a half meltdown and told him I had to get back to my hood. He initially tried to bargain with me, it was to no avail. We hopped into his 1980-something Reliant K station wagon to make the 8 mile drive. With my physical discomfort and the prospect of alleviating withdraw, the 20 minute ride felt closer to an hour. We stayed mostly silent as I shivered and sweat in the passenger seat. The trees and fields transitioned to buildings and lots as we weaved through the North side of Trenton. My internal paradox had intensified as we arrived in the city. The anxiety grew since there was a greater possibility for capture in Trenton. At the same time, the serenity rose knowing that soon I would have some relief from my opioid induced malady. The sun was on its way down. It was one of those humid summer nights where the sky glows all shades of orange and purple just before sunset. While arriving out front of my apartment building I found solace being back amongst the trash strewn streets of Chambersburg. For years I had felt my connection to life through the crumbling infrastructure of the inner city. McFlave solemnly bid his farewell as if I was a soldier shipping out to war. He wasn’t far off. I would be shipped before 24 hours was up. I didn’t even bother to walk upstairs into my apartment. I sat on the bench out front of the store and called Brownie. He didn’t answer. During my time in Trenton I think I saw one open air dope spot. The word was that the whole Perry St neighborhood had hustlers on every corner. If they were there I never saw them. It’s also possible that I was looking for the wrong situation. In North Philadelphia, where I spent most of my days, the dope spots were not camouflaged. Young black, brown and occasionally white brothers stood proudly on corners and let each passerby know which drugs could be purchased there or close by. Then, the hand to hand transaction was made outdoors only using two vehicles or buildings as cover from any nearby police. My understanding of Trenton was that the dope was sold inside of the brownstone tenement buildings on the 10-15 blocks surrounding Perry St. So anyone who wanted a particular brand of skag would have to know which building it was sold inside of and they would walk into the front door to be served. I dealt with a similar process in Paterson NJ however at that time I had never been locked up for any length of time as an adult so I was quicker to throw caution to the wind. Being on Probation in The Town, I wasn’t keen to spend hours in the hood searching for drugs and socializing with low level junkies. Brownie was a dope dealer I met while I was still in the halfway house. My Bunkie Ross was from the neighborhood and one of the illest hustlers I’ve ever met. Ross could turn a dime to a stack inside of a week and very seldom made his profit with drugs. He did know the guys who made their living selling crack and smack though. I think it was Ross who originally put me in touch with Brownie. Brownie was a hood anomaly. He spent years getting high on heroin. At some point he stopped using and started selling. He lived in a homeless shelter and I think part of the reason was because that was where most of his clientele was. As I was realizing that I was gonna have to take an Amtrak to Philly just to get one bag my phone rang. Brownie was calling back. It didn’t ring twice before I picked up. “Hey yo” I greeted meekly, showing myself just how weak the withdrawal made me. “What’s happening Shane” Brownie asked. He always called me Shane and I never corrected him. In the street using your real name can be detrimental. I told him I needed 2 and asked for 2 on consignment. My credit score in life is non-existent but in the dope game it was 850. I almost always got drugs fronted to me. Brownie told me to meet him at the 6ABC building next to the train station. I argued and told him that’s a terrible spot but he insisted. That part of the city was rampant with police and pedestrians and was about the worst place to buy drugs, especially as a fugitive. It seemed shifty but I let go of that notion relatively quickly. Any of the lethargy evaporated as I ran up to my apartment 2 steps at a time to grab my bike. While still at the halfway house I had acquired a murdered out, gunmetal beach cruiser with high rise handlebars. The only component on the bike that wasn’t black or gray was the thick whitewall tires. I kept my bike, apartment, and sneakers pristine. It was about 20 blocks from Chambersburg to the train station downtown. I pedaled down Emory St. through a lively neighborhood. I caught a few notes of the narcocorrido songs playing at Chapala, the corner bar. Immigrant’s children played on the sidewalks as I passed. Every car that rode by me sent tremors through the block from heavy bass in the songs they played, mostly Trap and Latino Hip-Hop. I thought to stop at the liquor store across from the park where Emory and Whitaker intersected, but there was a menacing crowd of MS-13 outside. Those were the only gangsters who ever made me nervous because my wit and charm would be useless without full command of the Spanish language. Past the park I weaved through a few quiet side blocks and turned left heading north on S. Clinton Ave. Clinton Ave was generally an unassuming city street. It varied between residential blocks and strips of storefronts. The blocks south of the Dye St bend were Latino restaurants, barber shops and botanicas. North of Dye St the blocks got visually poorer. Most of the storefronts were abandoned, as well as some of the homes, and the intersections near Hamilton ave looked like the perimeter of a landfill. The only business that appeared to have some measure of success was the Chinese Food/Liquor store. It wasn’t clean but the large brightly illuminated windows gave it that appearance. It was always busy and drew an unsavory crowed who milled about outside on Hamilton Ave. I made a mental note to stop and grab a drink on my way back home. 2 blocks past Hamilton I crossed over a small truss bridge that spanned a few railroad tracks leading to the train yard of the Trenton Station. This bridge signified the boundary of downtown. I didn’t like being in Trenton right now, and it was amplified while travelling through territory that housed poilice precinct, state buildings and other high security areas. People poured out of the station entrance from an incoming train and it helped me to relax. The more faces that were around the less likely a cop would focus on mine. Brownie was on the far side of the traffic light sitting alone inside a covered bus stop. I hopped off my cruiser and leaned it on the side of the structure. As we shook hands Brownie tried to nonchalantly pass off the product. However, it clumsily dropped out of our grasp as it did everytime I copped from him. Brownie always blamed me for this but I maintain that he was the klutz. “That’s 6” he said as I sat down with him, “2 are from a new connect, do those first and let me know what you think” I couldn’t help cracking a smile despite my depressed demeanor and anxiety riddled mental status. Testers weren’t uncommon on well established drug corners. I never got any from Brownie and this was a pleasant surprise. I would be able to have a bag or two when I woke up the next morning. With subtle incognito movements I reached in my pocket and placed two $10 bills on the bench next to me. I had no time to sit and chat I had to get the hell outta dodge and get high. In a blink I was back on the Cruiser and heading back down Clinton. As I sped past the Chinese liquor spot the thought of stopping for a drink had already disappeared. I was nauseous, anxious, in pain and had a mean case of diarrhea brewing. With the cure in my pocket I mutated from crippled junkie to Lance Armstrong. Each pedal stroke was taking me closer to the goal I would nearly die to achieve. Had I met Brownie in a different section of the city I would already have shot a bag of dope and been moseying my way home without any particular urgency. Here in the Downtown/Chambersburg corridor I didn’t know of one safe place to stop and take the few minutes to set up a syringe. My white T-shirt and gym shorts were soaked with sweat from withdrawing in August while riding a bike. I looked like a possessed man passing by nice Colombian families enjoying an Aguardiente in the summer heat. My legs were cramped and damn near inoperable when I reached home. I left my bike on the side of the building and stumbled up the stairs to fix a shot. The apartment was sparsely furnished and spotless. Years of incarceration had engrained a moral sense of duty to be clean and organized. I kept my tools of the trade in the nightstand near my bed. My hands trembled while I poured the tan powder from a white wax envelope into a water bottle cap. I add 10cc of water for each bag; no more, no less. Using the back of the diabetic syringe I stir up the cap until all the powder dissolves. I think “this is some good dope” when it turns the color of ice tea. I re-use the same speck of cotton for days at a time, dropping it into the cap to be used as a filter. Gently resting the tip of the needle on the browned filter I pull back on the syringe plunger and suck up 25 cc’s of the antidote. In the movies they squirt a few drops out to make sure there’s no air in the spike. I wouldn’t dare waste a few cc’s like that. I flick the body of the needle twice to let the air bubbles rise and then push the plunger just enough to remove them. All of my movements are made in a hurry but very methodically. I don’t want to spill the potion or miss a vein. The leather Polo belt snaps as I grab it off the bedroom door knob. I stick my right arm through the belt, wrap it twice and sink my teeth in to hold it in place. A thick vein inside my elbow pushes the yellow bruised skin up just enough to make its presence visible. Along that lump runs an inch of scars from previous years of needle pokes. The needle is old and dull so when I jab at the vein it hurts a bit more than normal also my nerves are on edge and it adds to the sharp prick. Immediately I see a bit of blood swirl up into the cylinder of the syringe. A red dragon from the same Asian country as the heroin its dancing in. I drive down the plunger as fast as it will go. Before I can pull the arm dart out and wipe the blood I get a tingle starting at the bottom of my back. It’s a warm euphoric version of your foot “falling asleep”. The pins and needles dance salsa up my back. When they reach my head the tingle shifts to an explosion and a wave of warm goo drips from my skull to my feet. I close my eyes and float in the feeling. Without even having the chance to take the needle out I fall out of consciousness in the most heavenly way. At 5:30 the next morning there was a knock at my door that woke me. My eyes opened and heart pounded. The soft light from the window signified that it was still early. I lay for a moment with my blood pressure pulsing all over my body. I knew at this time of day the only people showing up at my apartment were the police serving a warrant. My mind spun and the anxiety was unbearable. ‘This was it.’ ‘Or was it?’ If they were knocking than maybe they weren’t gonna kick the door down and I would be safe just staying still. They would leave at some point and I would make a break Florida immediately. A few more moments of silence, I was frozen stiff. I started thinking that maybe I didn’t really hear a knock, ‘I was just dreaming.’ I wasn’t sure that I heard a knock, it did happen while I was sleeping. A knock came again, but it wasn’t the normal cop knock. It was a knock to the rhythym of the Clipse song Grindin’. Now I’m all the way scared and confused. ‘Was it not the cops?’ ‘Were they trying to throw me off so I’d answer the door?’ It was only seconds but it felt like minutes when the next hip-hop knock came. This one settled my heart as it was accompanied by a voice. “YYEERRROOO!! COOOVVV!!” The relief was on par with last nights fix. The voice wasn’t immediately recognizable. I was sure, though, that whoever was at my door before the birds started chirping was friend not foe. With a dried stream of blood crusted on my forearm I got up from the bed and wobbled through the living room. Before the next knock came I peered through the peephole. It was Machine Gun Funk. Gun Funk was one of the most unique characters I’ve ever met. We spent a half of a year together during a bid in Middlesex County, a lockdown program in New Brunswick to be exact. He was a white kid from Hamilton, the suburb next to Trenton. He built a name for himself running through West Trenton with the Fruit Town Brims. Fruit Town was a set of Bloods that originated in a section of Compton California. There aren’t many Brims in Jersey but they are always official. Brims refer to each other with some form of the moniker Funk. P-Funk, D-Funk, Lo-Funk, etc. Gun Funk didn’t look like a gangster to the untrained eye. He wore khaki cargo shorts with leather sandals. He rocked a generic middle class white guy hair cut and fake diamond earrings. His face looked like he could have had a sprinkling of downs syndrome and he had a wrist full of friendship bracelets and leather bands. People who met Funk for the first time were more likely to think he just came home from Coachella Festival rather than a Correctional Facility. There were 2 things about Gun Funk that let the streets know he wasn’t your average college stoner. His tats and his beads. He wore red and white beads around his neck that blended in with the rest of his rave jewelry but were actually a symbol to his alliance to “Them Hat Boys”. He had a bunch of regular tats on his skin but the important one was on his forearm. In the joint someone inked an orange tree and a top hat below his elbow the tree symbolizing Fruit Town and the hat for Brim. I had talked to MGF a few weeks prior via Facebook and told him my door is always open now that I was in his backyard. I never thought he would show up but I was too happy to see him to be angry that it wasn’t yet 6am. We had both seen better days. I bypassed his outstretched hand and went straight for a hug. “What the fuck is going on?” I asked with intent and not just as a greeting. I stepped away from the entryway and we both sat on the old living room couch. Gun Funk offered me a Maverick Menthol but I declined and pulled out a Newport from my own pack on the coffee table. I was eager to find out why this guy who I hadn’t seen in over a year was showing up on my doorstep. He began to break down the story. Like me MGF was a vivid storyteller which was a great skill for street dudes who wound up in the most unusual situations. A picture was painted for me of a night of drugs and sex that ended here in my apartment. Funk had been sniffing blow with a barely legal teenage girl in her parent’s house on Chambers St. As he told me more of the details it became clear that he was pretty fried. They did the normal sniffing lines off her ass kinda stuff. Sometime before the sun rose and the coke was getting sparse the girl’s father woke up to get ready for his work day. Pops must have heard some commotion from his precious daughter’s bedroom and looked to find his baby girl with Ol’ Funks gun in her mouth. I’ve never laughed so hard before my morning coffee and shot. Her Pops threw Funk outta the house like he was Jazzy Jeff. I saw the freshly scraped elbows that were proof. Chambers was only a few blocks from my place on Emory. With his phone and wallet still in homegirl’s bedroom MGF figured to try his luck at my house. I believed every word of his story. It wasn’t too far off from a situation I had or may find myself in. I was glad to see him and even more elated that he came bearing such an outlandish story. I made us a pot of coffee. After years of jail time Gun Funk adjusted to drinking his coffee John Wayne, meaning no cream and no sugar. I made my cup a Little Wayne, just sugar, I hadn’t bought cream or milk since my last shopping trip a few weeks ago. We sat for a few minutes as I told him about my fugitive status and plans to get out of The Town a.s.a.p.. He wanted to kick it at my spot for a few hours until he could safely retrieve his phone and wallet. That was fine by me, I was glad to have some company for the day. I handed him the remote and told him to watch what he wants. I hadn’t paid the cable bill in a while but they hadn’t cut it off just yet. I went to the bedroom and grabbed my tools for a morning fix. I did it in the bathroom then hopped in the shower. After getting dressed and making my way back to the couch, I saw that gun funk had dozed off. He had crashed from being zooted all night, and wouldn’t be waking up anytime soon. I decided to head downstairs to the deli that was the first floor of the building. I figured I could talk to my landlord and see if he might have had my security deposit for me. As I stepped foot out the door my landlord Johnny greeted me with his friendly smile. He had an espresso cup in one hand and a Marlboro in the other. Johnny was a family man nowadays but had grown up in the streets back when Chambersburg was a tough Italian part of town. I believe he genuinely felt for me and didn’t like to see me living this life. We had talked about my plan for getting to Florida, if I really felt like this was the move and what I would do long term. He told me that by the end of the day he would have money for me. I felt uncomfortable in more ways than one. I didn’t like putting Johnny in the spot I did. I also didn’t like standing out in the open during broad daylight. As we chatted I watched every car that past. One of those cars was an older model, dark gray Crown Victoria that may have had government plates. Later on it registered to me that the driver of that car looked an awful lot like my Probation Officer. Since he didn’t stop at the time I made the choice to believe it was just a coincidence. After shooting the breeze for an hour or so I made my way upstairs to do another shot. Knowing that money was coming my way that afternoon stopped me from being conservative with my last few bags. Gun Funk was still dead asleep when I came out of the bathroom from doing a double shot. The Regis and Kelly show wasn’t holding my attention so I grabbed the remote off the coffee table and put on Animal Planet. It was a dry documentary about cheetahs, the perfect background noise to nod out to. I layed on the floor with my head propped on the base of the couch and focused on losing focus. “ BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM” four heavy knocks on the door. I sprang to my feet. Funks eyes shot open and we stared at eachother our eyes lit with fear. There was no mistaking that knock. The panic had surged my adrenaline and any inkling of being high had vanished from my body. I was hoping against all odds that my door wasn’t about to kicked off the hinges. As quietly as I could I crept to a spot where I could look under the door. My nightmare was confirmed. I saw more than a few pairs of black boots on the floor of my apartments vestibule. I mouthed the words to Machine Gun Funk “Black Boots!” I was expecting at any moment to see the door come flying open. Instead I heard another round of aggressive taps with an angry woman’s voice afterward “Trenton Police”. I remained as still as I could though my heart beat as loud as the cop’s knock. I couldn’t breathe. Deep inside I thought that maybe they were going to leave had I not answered the door. Then came the only sound worse than a battering ram busting the door down. It was the most fearful sound I could have imagined at that point, and it was no louder than a phone’s vibration. I heard a key clicking into my doorknob. “ohhh fuucckk” I muttered breaking my silence. The door swung open with dynamic force knocking the Crucifix above it off the wall onto the head of the 2nd cop through. A brunette lady cop with her gun drawn at my face yelled to get down. I was paralyzed staring at the barrel and the enraged face behind it. “ “Hit the fucking ground!!!” the second time she punctuated the statement with a wave of the gun. I snapped from my trance and dropped face first on the carpet. Funk did the same while in the crosshairs of a different gun. Immediately after I got down two linebacker sized pink skinned piglets in plain clothes pounced on me. I caught a gun butt in the back of my head that should have required a few stitches. I took a few swift boots to the torso. I wound up with a knee grinding my face into the floor while another pansy twisted my arm backwards way beyond its capability. Dazed from the blow to the head I can only imagine that MGF got the same treatment. After a few moments I was lifted to my feet violently to see that Sgt. Swine Slut was rummaging through my cabinets. She looked like the captain of an NCAA womens hockey team. In a momentary lapse of judgment I said to her “You looking for something to eat?” That earned me a quick but weak jab to the gut from one of her flunkies. She didn’t bother responding after that. Two more plain clothes doughboys stood over my cohort and asked me with malice “who’s this?” I remained silent as Gun Funk uttered his government name. I didn’t have the chance to hear anymore of that conversation as I was drug down the steps out to an unmarked police cruiser. As I sat in the back of that car the only thing I could think of through the pain throbbing in my head was that “I only missed a probation meeting, I don’t deserve this”. I didn’t have trouble believing that I took this beating from the Police. It only added to the disgust I had for the justice system and government. Behind the shit storm of emotions and underneath the silent tears I knew one thing. I was glad this is over. Being on the run, even for this short period had taken its toll on my soul. I looked forward to getting to jail so I could finally get some rest.",
2290,"Drugs are the only thing that stops me from killing myself...Being sober is the worst, I know it's not healthy to take drugs to numb and avoid emotional pain but I've had enough suffering for a life time. Anxiety wants to my life, and Depression wants to end my life. But when I take sedatives to feel calm and relaxed, I'm happy. When I take depressants to be stress free, guess what. I'm F*CKING HAPPY. I think the problem with drugs is miseducation and smear campaigns. There's such stigma towards drug use and I understand why. Drugs can ruin and save lives.",
2291,"I Plan On Killing Myself TonightI grew up abused. Physically and mentally. My parents were terrible drug addicts they will never amount to anything. I stayed strong growing up to make sure my siblings were safe. I found out that 2 of my sisters were raped over and over growing up. I failed. I used to strive everyday to be better. Build a career for myself. Be the best I can be. I joined the army. Built a great career. Found an amazing girl I planned on marrying. I got layer off. Company downsizing. I was out of work for a month or 2 when we were already barely afloat. I work 2 jobs now. But just got a letter saying rent is behind and my phone is behind when I tried to call. I failed my girlfriend and my career. I’m as good as my parents. I have failed. I try so hard to be the best I can be. To be better for me, my girlfriend, my sibling, what would of been my future children. But in the end I failed. My head has so many bad memories I can barely find the good. I can’t stand to think what I’m going to do if I get kicked out of my apartment. What it will do to my girlfriend. Her future. I can’t stand to see that. I have thought of many ways to make the money none of which make enough. The military won’t help me. With my feelings or finically. What I do have is life insurance. Lots of it from the military. This will allow my girlfriend to finish school and get an apartment. My siblings to get what they need. My sister is about to have a kid. She is young so she will need money. At this point I think the best way for me to help. Is to be dead. Thanks reddit for the help through the years. It’s been a wild ride through life but I think I can finally Rest In Peace knowing I helped those I love. Goodbye. Edit: I have read through all the messages and replies. Let me tell ya. Over the past few hours I have cried a lot. I’m kinda at a lose for words. All I can say is thank you. I’m going to get better. It’s going to get better. The strongest thing I can do right now is stay alive. Thank you all. If it weren’t for the messages I wouldn’t be alive right now. Edit 2: it has been a very long day. I assure you I have read through every single message over and over. Word after word. I have cried more than any person possible could. I have read through some and people may think i was or still am going to end my life. I’m not. I can’t. I won’t. Without all the messages and comments. I would be dead. I was so close to doing it. I drove out to a spot in the middle of nowhere and was ready to let everything go. Then notification after notification came on my phone. I started to read message after message and started to realize the mistake I was. I posted this for basically my last resort goodbye to the world. In the hopes that one person a single person would maybe talk me out of it. Little did I know there was what seemed like hundreds of people with such amazing words. One of the first people that commented said something about my cat (her name is Baby but I call her Bebe) that’s basically where I broke down. I have no idea why but I did. I got back in my car and read all the comments. I cried for hours in my car till I called my girlfriend and her mom. They talked me through it. I then went to the VA and had me talk to a therapist. I made an appointment. A step. My girlfriends parents were able to dig up some money for rent so I me and my girlfriend won’t be homeless. So that again in a positive. Things seemed very very dark today. But there is a small light now. If it was not for everyone here I wouldn’t be seeing this light. I’m not better right now. I won’t be better in a week. Maybe not even a month or a year. But I’m alive and I’m going to work on it. I’m going to get better. For my girlfriend, for my sisters, for my cat, for my future kids, but most importantly for me. Thank you everyone. I’m literally in your all’s debt. Right now though I’m tired. Very tired. I’m going to sleep and tomorrow...is a new day with all new possibilities. Not goodbye, but goodnight",

I have had some victories like getting a job, moving out etc but my Ns ultimately win.I was a child and they were adults and there was no one to protect me from them, it's not fair...",
2293,"when faced with inconveniences both minor or major, or things that I can work towards to possibly fix, I just think ""killing myself would be easier and less work""Just me? Currently failing nearly 5/6 classes. Im an idiot and there are a lot of other issues.",
2294,When I was a kid I planned on killing myself in front of my parents.Hello. I was born into a family with a brother who was violently sexually abusive. It started when I was 4 and continued up until I was 13. At the same time I was abused by other pedophile who was not violent but still obviously abusive from the ages of 10 to 13. I told my parents about the second abuser and they put him in jail and rallied around me with total support. I told my parents about my brother who was 20 at this time now and they bullied me into lying to the police so that my brother wouldn’t get into trouble. It worked my brother got away with his crimes. I had been suicidally depressed since I was 7 and resented my parents for what they have done to me and for having put me in this situation to smile and be polite and nice to my brother during family events and holidays so they and he could pretend everything was okay. I hated them for what they had done to me and I hated life and wanted to die. So at 13 I made a plan to kill myself but to punish my parents by making them watch me die. That’s it. That’s all I had to say I guess. I didn’t do it obviously I grew up and got away from my home. But I still think about it all the time and look back in horror in how awful my life was at the time that I even considered that.,

2298,"Question just to make sure I'm not killing myselfSo I'm not really all that experienced with meth, done it a few times but always controlled it really well because eventually it would just stop working and I'd put the bag away for a month. Recently though I bought a bag that is the smoothest shit I have ever come across, and I've been unable to stop using or even force myself to sleep. That's not really a problem though, I'm almost out and have benzos for the comedown. The problem is yesterday I was experiencing the symptoms of jaundice (vision was yellow, I was yellow etc) but they went away after I ate a bit of food and a banana. I'm wondering if it was the being retarded and forgetting to eat for several days that caused the jaundice (like do you guys get this problem too?). Or if I should go see a doctor because my liver might be on the verge of failing. Obviously not asking legit medical advice, just wanna know if this has happened to anyone else before I get to enjoy hours of waiting at the doctor's office.",
2299,"I didn't think about killing myself today, like not at all!!!I honestly can't remember the last time I didn't think about ending it, I can't remember the last time I felt this good:) There's a guy in my life and I can't be more grateful for him, it's thanks to him that I feel like this and I just hope that you all have a guy like this:) keep on fighting guys! It's worth it, well I guess at least:)",
