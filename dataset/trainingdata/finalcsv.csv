1,"i cry everydayIs that normal? Do more depressed people do this? Whenever I'm alone, I cry. I'm alone a lot. As i'm writing this there's a tear rolling from my cheek. I've always been a bit of a crybaby but it has never been this much. Multiple times a day I'm crying. I cry myself to sleep everynight. In the beginning my family would notice but I think they stopped bothering. Either that or I'm really good at covering it up.",0
2,"So depressed I can’t cry.It’s been a rough few months. Nothing in my life was going wrong but I had weened off of my antidepressant (on/off SSRIs for a number of years but didn’t feel great so thought I’d see what I was like off of my low dose SSRI) and was just feeling a constant depression/anxiety with anhedonia and hopelessness. Things got bad about a month ago to the point that I felt suicidal, so I stopped drinking as drinking always worsens my depression. Didn’t get much better and, a week after that, an old friend committed suicide. It was a very notable suicide for reasons I don’t wish to state and his death and funeral have been covered extensively by local news. Just constant reminders daily. I got a little choked up at the funeral but didn’t actually cry and that’s when I realized I can’t cry anymore. This is the most depressed I’ve ever been in my life and I think it is different from past lows as I’m so low, i would not ever describe it as sadness. I’m not sad. I’m completely empty and it’s a far worse feeling. I would love to cry and feel some sort of release. Just trying to hang in there until my psych appt in a few days. Wondering if anyone’s experienced the same kind of thing with crying (or lack thereof)?",1
3,"I can't cry. Last time I cried a few years ago. And if I sometimes want these emotions to flow out, I can't. Anyone of you have a similar experience?",0
4,"Im always sad but i cant cry anymoreLife is so tiring and everything makes me so sad but I can't cry about it. I just sit there and give up, at least crying was a good release. Now I just sit in numbness",0
5,"I can't cry anymore.18 M. It's been a few years being in and out of hospitals, trying many different kinds of medications and such. I've put so much stress on my family and their time, it doesn't feel right. I know it's not something I can help, but it's still frustrating for everyone when I can't show signs of improvement. I'm wouldn't say I'm sick of it, just tired is all. I just want to die. I want to get out of this world so badly, and I can't understand it. I'm scared, but I don't have any other choice. I was 15 when this all started, and I've lost 10 pounds in 3 years when I was still supposed to be growing. The doctors say I am at an unhealthy weight for my height, talking about anorexia problems and such. I've lost the desire to eat. I haven't talked to many of my friends since graduating, and I haven't been to any graduation parties I said I would go to. I just can't care. It doesn't matter if I see them again. It just doesn't matter. I've always wanted a girlfriend, always waiting for that special somebody to come by, but I'm not capable of being a boyfriend. I want to spend time with somebody, but this world feels so empty. They say longing is the joy of being sad, so I guess I shouldn't call it that. I'm just waiting. I know there are people who will make this world feel full again, but I don't think I even want to be happy anymore. I just can't see it. I want to die. I want to die so badly, please. I don't want to feel this pain anymore, I can't take it. I dont want any comments telling me to get better, just Please tell me some painless options I can take. I don't own a gun. I'm looking for something to make this all go away. Please tell me what to do.",1
6,"Sometimes, after a terrible day, i’m just in my shower, here beteween; i want to cry and please can i be in my perfect imaginary world? And... i just can’t. i can’t cry but i can’t escape reality ethier so i just stare a nothing, thinking about nothing... do you know what i mean?",0
7,i cant cry...everyone says a good cry will help but the trouble is that i cant cry... a couple tears will come out and that's it! i wish i could cry! i wish i could let it all out! but i can't!,0
8,"I cry myself to sleep every night because my baby was born with Down'sThere are so many emotions. This is our first baby and my husband said it will be our last because our son was born with Down's. It was something we never tested for because we weren't considered high-risk and it doesn't run in the family. I feel guilty for so many reasons. Like I let my husband down, I did something to cause this and that I probably would have had an abortion if I knew. But I love this baby so much and he's mine for better or worse. I feel angry because I'm being robbed of a normal parenthood. I drink so much that I blackout and sometimes have these dreams where my baby is born with no defects or wake up HOPING to God it was all a nightmare. &#x200B; EDIT: People who say he's a gift are the same people who said ""congrats"" when I was pregnant to ""my sympathy"" when he was born.",0
9,"I cry during sexIdk what's wrong with me but often while I have sex with my boyfriend I cry. At the beginning I thought that was because I didn't wanted it but I couldn't admit it to myself but no that's definitely not it,I really want and like it. I tried searching online the answer to why would I do that, but the results were cringe, I just want to know am I the only one? I think I enjoy it, the crying, I think it's because I'm really submissive and I started seeing it as a part of the role play, but I hope my boyfriend doesn't notice this, like ever, that would be weird... Does anyone else do that ever?",0

No weight gain, sexually I’m horny almost 24/7 it’s annoying lol. I have thoughts of wanting to die everyday",0
14,"I cried on my first run this morning.I’ll get straight to the point. 18 months ago I had a massive stroke. I’m a 26 year old male who got diagnosed with SLE lupus when I was 21. This basically led me to having a very weak immune system. This this then led contracting the shingles about 14 months ago, which infected my brain and caused it to swell up leading to a stroke. I woke up one morning not been able to move my entire left side. Through a lot of hard fucking work and intense physio sessions I got back near total use of left side. I have been doing IF the last 6 months with tracking my calories and lost about 16kg (sorry Americans). I have been doing boxing sessions the past few months twice a week. I have always had a huge admiration for people who got up early to go running. This morning I said it’s time I did exactly that. Set my alarm for 7am to the annoyance of my girlfriend, stretched, then off I went. I had no exact plan of how far I would or could go. I knew at some points I would need to stop and walk. All I had was my ‘Map my Run’ app. When it stopped my music and said to me I had ran 2km without stopping I broke down in tears. I couldn’t walk 18 months ago, now this. In the end I ran for 3.6km in just under 30 minutes with stopping to walk for 5 minutes. I’m sorry for rambling, my girlfriend is asleep and I text my parents with excitement who are also asleep so really needed to tell someone and I hope you strangers can appreciate how happy I am right now. Edit : for the couple of people who messaged and anyone else wondering, when I say boxing it’s strictly bag and pad work, no sparring. I think my brain has been through enough lol. Also my first ever awards! Thank you so much kind strangers!",0
15,"My greatest fantasy is to be tied and whipped till I cry. When that’s done, caged till my master wants to use me again. I want to be a bitch that’s collared and naked who is plugged up in all holes including my urethra. Mittens that bound me so I am helpless and at the mercy of my master.",0
16,"Why can’t I cry?I never cry, I will get so sad and upset at myself to the point I’ll plan out my suicide, I’ll wish the world away. I will be so depressed it hurts my chest and stomach, but I never cry. The tears never come. I want to release this sadness. I want to cry and finally be able to express my emotions, I currently feel like I’m going to puke from holding everything in but I don’t know how to let it out",0
17,"I have nothing now but praise for my life. I’m not unhappy. I cry a lot because I miss people. They die and I can’t stop them.

18,"Everyone always tells me that it will get better and you’ll be happy someday. That’s a fucking lie.

22,"You have to read this! Elders sent me this email. Hahahaha I cryHere's the email: \---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear Timothy, We observe that you are really bothered for 8 months with the validity of 1914/1919 doctrine, and that it has affected your life and your relationship with Jehovah. Yesterday I talked with both br. Jonathan and the coordinator, Tom, who loves you very much, as his grandson, as his child. The opinion of all of us, and also of our elder physician, Dr. Duke, is that you have a serious problem with obsessive-compulsive behavior. Many extremely smart people like you have a characteristic or if you want a uniqueness in their brain function. They are totally focused on specific issues. So much of what goes on around them goes unnoticed. And this helps them to deal with complex issues in depth. A ""side loss"", however, is the frequent obsessive-compulsive disorder (one such case being the well-known Albert Einstein). For this reason, I ask you to reconsider in a positive way the advice given by Dr. Duke, that is to ask for help from a qualified psychiatrist. The relief you’ll feel I think will be impressive. Do not allow stupid mindsets (of the type ""you say I’m crazy now ?!..."") and the fact that you have been isolated for a long time from the congregation to prevent you from dealing with your ""practical wisdom"" problem ... (Proverbs 18: 1) It saddens me that you are so much bothered about the 1914/1919 doctrines. Does it really matter to stay away from Jehovah for some dates? But because the writing is cold, I would like we have a chat in person. On Friday I will go to Orlando to take care of my grandma. Would you like to come and have a coffee? I love you and I really want to help you. Your friend, Dimitris. \------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",0

25,"Why can't I cry?Background: Age: 38 Sex: Male Race: White Height: 65 inches Weight: 220 lbs Location: USA Medications: Omeprazole; Fluoxetine; Ropinrole; Buproprion; Doxepin; CPAP Profession: Attorney; combat veteran (Iraq; Army) In October, I lost four members of my family to murder-suicide. Two weeks later, my wife was raped. Two and a half months after that, my mother-in-law took her life, and my father-in-law tried to ""follow her"" (as he put it) and was in ICU for several days. All day, every day, I feel like I'm about to break down. I can *feel* the tears behind my eyes, but I just can't cry. The last time I cried was my brother's funeral almost four months ago. I want to get rid of this feeling behind my eyes. I want to cry, if that's what it takes . . . but I can't. It's maddening. As odd as it sounds, I liken it to being constipated. What can I do save for watching *Schindler's List* on loop? EDIT: Since some have asked about the antidepressants, I've been on fluoxetine for about a decade and buproprion for a few years. I also have PTSD and a traumatic brain injury from my military days.",0
26,"I cry at everything now that I am a parent.My daughter is soon to be 16 months old. I have never experienced the intensity of love that I feel for her. It almost scares me! Something else I've slowly noticed, and weirdly enough it steadily intensified along with my bond with her, is that I'm crying at everything now. Pre-kid it would take a lot for me to get emotional but now, not at all. I was home on veteran's day watching daytime TV, some lady and her kids won a trip to see their husband/dad, I sobbed for 5 minutes. Before I would have been like ""Huh. Good for them, they deserve it"" and flipped the channel. I ran across that clip of Steve Irwin going on and on about his daughter, I bawled. I am constantly getting this way seeing sweet or sad stuff on TV, movies, songs, etc. Can anyone relate? I have never been one to be comfortable showing intense emotions so this is a learning experience for me but I don't mind it. It's added a depth to life I don't think I would have experienced pre-kid and I'm thankful for that. I have to laugh at myself and what a 180 this seems to have caused in the emotional part of me. Edit: Oh my gosh this blew up! Here I was on this Monday morning reflecting on how much I've grown over the past 16 months and how thankful I am for my daughter. What an absolute blessing she is... it takes my breath away. I have no idea what I did to deserve this precious little girl. Sometimes I can't believe this is my life and I took to Reddit today feeling a bit overwhelmed over it all, honestly, wondering if I'm the only one who feels like my heart is about to burst every day, all that emotion has to come out somehow and it ends up being tears for me a lot of the time. :) I had no idea I'd get this kind of response. I've smiled, laughed, cried, and done it all over again today reading through all of your responses and experiences. Thank you all! It's been such a joy coming back throughout the day to read your comments. I guess the consensus is, lots of people can relate to this, and what a beautiful ride parenthood is!",0

32,"My toddler laughs when I cry or am in painMy 2.5 year old (almost 3) laughs when I show visible signs of pain or when my husband fake cries to show that my son hitting or throwing things at him hurt. Instead of showing guilt or compassion, my son starts to laugh or smile. Should I be concerned or is my concern an overreaction? How did you teach your child empathy? The reason why I feel a little more sensitive about this these days is that my son recently threw a toy at a kid (because the kid didn't want to share his toys) and the kid's nose started bleeding. Although my son looked somewhat startled and scared because the kid glared at him in response, my son still had a little anger in his eyes (he did say sorry though, upon prompting). I chalk his anger up to his language delay and being a toddler, but it still worries me. Thank you for reading!",0
33,"I really cant process this one. I feel like i lost a family member. Everytime i wake up the first thought i have is ""kobe is gone"" and its the last thing i think about as i cry to sleep. I cant function like this man..i guess I just want to know theres others on here who feel like i do rnI'm 28. I remember the very first time I saw Kobe play. It was 1998 and when my older brother pointed him out to me while we watched the Laker game with my dad. He basically explained to me hes a very young player around the same age as him, and as he said this kobe had a sick breakaway dunk (one of those dunks where the ref blows the whistle but the player still dunks it on a fast break just for crowd reaction) &#x200B; I was instantly hooked. &#x200B; I was there for every moment after. The three peat, the rape case, the breakup with Shaq, the smush/kwame/mihm era...the climb back to the top with Pau. Every clutch shot, every kobe moment, every interview i tuned in...i followed him religiously. My cousins and friends would often tease me for being such a huge fan of someone i never met. &#x200B; &#x200B; I fucking cried like a little kid when he tore his achilles. But this just feels like a knife to the chest. I feel empty inside, man. And im a grown ass man but idgaf! I feel what I feel. I cant say this to family or friends but i can say this here...I feel fucked up...like i lost a real life friend or relative. I cant sleep but all I do most of the time once i get home is curl up in bed. I dont eat much, I dont give a damn about any hobbies i have. I really dont know if ill ever keep up with the nba again. Basketball is dead to me rn. &#x200B; My family or friends dont understand irl, but this man was my childhood. I cant believe this happened. What a horrible tragedy. And to have his daughter go with him? This is the worst tragedy in the celebrity world to me &#x200B; This life is some bs. Life really is a bitch. He didnt deserve to go out like this man. I really cant believe kobe is gone.",0
34,"Is it weird that I cry when I dont understand homework sometimes?Like if I run into a problem, I will get mad and immediately start searching for help or answers online. When I cant find any of that I start to cry. For example if im doing math questions and I don't understand one, I cry because I dont want to move on to the next question until I get that one. I refuse to leave a question blank and go to the next one. Yeah I could ask professors or tutors for help but that takes a bit of time, and I usually want help right away. I dont want to schedule an appointment with a tutor because then I have to wait and like I said I refuse to move on until I get the question im stuck on. And then if im waiting, I refuse to do the homework so now im wasting time doing everything else but homework",0
35,"Why do I cry when I worshipThis is a question I have asked, for I can’t quite help myself, and my answer is revealed throughout the Bible, yet I’m going to share with you Paul’s message to the Church of Ephesus. In Ephesians 1 lies a revealing of why tears come. It is because in Christ are we set free, having been **redeemed/purchased** by his blood, and so we have forgiveness. This redemption **reveals the wealth** of God’s grace, which he has so fully and freely lavished on us. God let us know His **secret purpose, the mystery of His will**. This was what God wanted and planned to do through Christ. His goal was to carry out his plan, when the right time came that **all things in heaven and on earth would be joined together** in Christ as the head. In Christ **we were chosen to be God’s people**, we were chosen so that we would bring praise to God’s glory. When you heard the Good News you believed in Christ. And in Christ, God put his special mark of ownership on you, His Holy Spirit. And that is but a down payment of His promise, of what we will receive from God until He gives full freedom **to those who are His**. This is the promise to all of God’s people, the saints. For a greater understanding has been put into our heart so we will know the hope to which He has called us and that we will know, to know how rich and glorious are the blessings God has promised His holy people, the saints. We will know God’s power is exceedingly; overwhelmingly great for us who believe. This is the promise to all of God’s people, the saints. For God’s people are a collective group “the saints,” and not some landmark on the ground or authority. We are those given the power to see God and hear his Word and praise Him. Many have eyes and do not see, they have ears but cannot hear, for only the chosen people of God get to know the power of true worship and praise, overwhelming or exceeding thankfulness, it’s real, it’s hart felt and it heals from the inside out. So this is why I cry, for how can I not when I have been been purchased from the bonds of sin, when I have been revealed the truth and given a promise I am not worthy of. For God chose a wretch like me, and made me into a saint.",0

Once i’m somewhat “calmed” from controlled breathing, the second i feel relieved, i immediately go back to crying and being upset. It’s exhausting & debilitating because i really cannot leave the house like i’m supposed to a lot of the time. And i’m tired of letting others down being the hyper sensitive person i am.",0

50,"My girlfriend (23f) and I (26m) have been together for 2 1/2 years and she cheated on me 3 days ago.Edit 4: final update. As you can guess by the previous two words, things didnt go well. We managed to get through a couple therapy sessions and they seemed to go well. The therapist herself said we seemed like a good fit for one another but it seems it was too little too late. She claimed she couldn't handle feeling like she did over what she had done on top of her sadness. She said I didn't try to fix things when she told me something was wrong and she wasnt happy many months ago, despite her telling me the same thing then as she did now which was that she didnt know what was wrong or how to fix it. She said she believes I could make her happy again but that the relationship we had isn't the kind she wants to have forever. Which means, her words not mine, she wants a country guy who lives a country life. She wants to hunt, fish, ride horses and do whatever it is ""country"" guys do. It's not enough that I've done and enjoyed many of the things she wants to do (though not at all with her because of where we live/our schedules and not having easy access to that kind of stuff). ""It's not who you are"" so she doesn't want to be with me anymore. I didn't want to post this because I didn't want the naysayers to know they were right. It's bad enough I've lost who I thought I'd be with forever, I don't want people telling me I told you so too. If anyone has any advice on where to go now, I'm all ears. It has been a month and 10 days since she broke up with me and I'm struggling to get by emotionally. Music makes me think of her, seeing places we used to go together a lot reminds me of her, and because of our situation she's still in my life to a small but relevant enough degree that I still have to talk to her a few times a week. I'm not sure what to do to help myself get over her. I care about her so much despite what she did to me and I want to let that go. What can I do? Edit 3: I never imagined I'd get this kind of response, I was just hoping to get it off my chest and see where that left me but I appreciate everyone's comments, especially those who shared similar experiences and how they've handled it. I know some may think of me (if we're combining all the insults and jabs at me) as a spineless pushover doormat horse, but I've decided for the time being to try to work it out. She has agreed to counseling/therapy to help find the cause of her unhappiness. Whether it's something we've already guessed or something as bad as clinical depression. She has also agreed to open, and complete honesty. No questions unanswered, nothing left hidden, no more communication with the guy at all, and to start on bettering her communication skills. She knows she's bad at communicating her thoughts and feelings about love and relationships, that's something that has changed since she had been so down as we used to be the happiest couple you could ever find. Once we determine the cause if the unhappiness or if this ends in tragedy before then I'll return with an additional update. I'll do my best to get to all the comments I deem helpful. Sorry guys telling me to dump her and move on, your comments are a dime a dozen so I'm not going to spend my time answering them all, even if they are what turns out to have been the best idea. I came here for help and advice in making it work. To those who came and have offered advice and their take on the situation I sincerely appreciate the response and hope they help me in some way. Thanks again for everything, see you soon hopefully with good news. Edit 2: It seems that I have left some stuff out, so I'll address it here. All the statements concerning Trickle truthing are wrong regarding how far they went. It ended as I said it did I have both confirmation from her from him as well as the fact that her storylines up until a few minutes before I showed up at his house because I felt something was off that night. And as I pulled into his driveway (which wraps around his and several other houses and let's out onto a side street) and drove around behind his house I saw her car pulling out onto said Street. There was only 3 to 4 minutes unaccounted for. Plenty of time for what did happen but not enough for what people believe happened. As they both texted me around the time she left. I'm sure I forgotten something again but if I think of it all edit a third time. Edit: Thank you for responding, everyone. We've been talking back and forth all day and while I've been constant on wanting to make things whole again she has even back and forth about if she thinks it's even worth fixing because she doesnt know how. I'm not sure what to tell her. What would be the first steps? I'm not sure where to even begin, as the weight of it all is finally hitting me. My girlfriend and I have been dating since March of 2016. We hit it off and things were amazing for the first year or so. Little things popped up afterwards when we moved and she began to get homesick, she moved 2 hours from where she's lived her whole life a little over 4 months before she and I got together, and things started going south. After some rough patches, finding out she wanted to move back home through messages to her friends (without specifying she wanted me to come with her) we talked about her happiness and she said she wasn't as happy as she wanted to be, living where we live now and expressed some concerns she had with my part in the relationship. I've since worked on those issues, I spend more time with her, less with games and help out around the house more than I used to. I've always been bad with dishes and laundry but am now usually the one taking care of them (we do laundry together) while she cooks most often. The other night we had made a pot roast and she took some to a friends house because his fridge had broken overnight and they lost all the food they had in it. I was worried something was going on because of some behavioral things I'd picked up on the previous nights when we had all 3 been at the gym together. I asked her what was taking so long for her to get home (he lives only 5 minutes away and it had been almost an hour. She told me she stopped to get gas, talked with her crazy friend on the phone for a bit (who called her because she didn't respond to a Snapchat message fast enough) and had to wait for him as he was in the bathroom when she arrived. I've had trust issues in the past, both in previous relationships and with her because of her lying about wanting to move away and being happy with me. I asked her about it and expressed my concerns. She showed me a receipt for gas as well as her call log showing that her friend did in fact call her during the time she was gone. I let it go, blaming my own paranoia and fear and we went to bed. This morning ( these events happened this past Sunday evening) I went through her phone (I know, it's bad, don't do it, you're breaking her trust, etc. etc.) before I could stop myself and I saw messages saved between her and this guy. I'll skip the details of the messages, needless to say I confronted her and she admitted to making out with him and to him having his hand down her pants. She cried, I cried a while after and am unsure if I've stopped since. She's at work as I write this. I've since asked her if she would have told me if I didn't find out, and she said probably not. She followed up by saying she didn't know when I asked if she would have let this happen again and get further. She's said that she wants to make things right but doesn't know how, that her unhappiness has made her into something she's not. But she doesn't really know why she's unhappy (beyond not living back in her hometown with her friends). I'm at a loss myself as to what to do. I love her, even after this, whether that's a mistake or not remains to be seen. I want to move past this and forgive her but I know it won't be easy, for either of us. She has said the same to me, that she still loves me, doesn't know why she did it and wants to try and fix things. What should we do? What are the most successful options? And what can I do to ease this pain.. Any help or advice would be appreciated. tldr: girlfriend cheated, expressed remorse and we still love each other but the trust is gone. How can we bring it back and make things between us better again?",0
51,"My ex-wife’s friends tell her how happy she looks with her new bf, but they have no idea that she cheated on me.I want so badly to tell her friends how horrible she was to me. I won’t do that, but I’ve got to tell someone. I need people to know that she is not who they think she is. Seeing her friends (some of whom had also become my friends) comment on how happy she looks in pictures of her and her new boyfriend has wrecked me. That alone has been harder to deal with than the actual divorce. I don’t think they would be saying that if they knew she had cheated on me with an ex-boyfriend. I wonder what they would think if they knew she was emotionally manipulative and abusive. Anything they’ve been told about the divorce has probably been an outright lie, or at best, a misrepresentation of what really happened. It’s also taking an enormous amount of will power to not reach out to her new bf and warn him that she is a narcissist who comes from a family of emotionally controlling people. So, instead, I just sit here, an emotional wreck who cringes at the thought of dating again even though it has been over a year. My ex, on the other hand, was plastering a new relationship all over Facebook within a few months.",0
52,"My girlfriend cheated on me I am so angry, disappointed, upset and frustrated all in one. Just feel like throwing my TV out of the window and then myself with it. I caught her about 6 weeks ago messaging a guy from her work talking about wanting to do sexual things with him and I saw a load of pictures she had taken of herself naked/in her underwear on her phone but couldn’t find any evidence she had sent it (even though I knew for sure she did). Obviously she denied this. She said that she never did anything with him and it was wrong but harmless. I was furious but I wanted to believe her. I told her if I ever found anything like this again I wouldn’t even give her another chance. Anyway I noticed she changed her password on her phone so alarm bells were going off and she was acting weird. She fell asleep tonight with her phone turned on so I took it and had a browse. All of her messages on WhatsApp etc are all deleted, even between her and her friends. Had a look in her pictures and saw more nudes/underwear shots again but this time I saw a picture of someone’s dick in between the nudes and a load of screen shotted messages with that guy saying how she wanted him to fuck her and how she wanted his dick in her mouth. All of this stuff is dated a couple of weeks ago. I confronted her about it and kicked her out. I’m so angry and betrayed right now. I know more has gone on but she will never admit it Edit: We were together for 5 years",0

54,"My [24M] girlfriend [24F] cheated on meThrowaway for obvious reasons. My girlfriend and I have been together for over a year and moved in with each other back in June 2019. The beginning of the relationship was amazing (honeymoon phase) but over the past 2 or so months, things have kind of taken a turn for the worst. It didn't feel like we were really dating but more like roommates with each other. We had tried having conversations about it but things didn't really change. Cue this past weekend she was with some friends while I stayed home to hang out with a few of my friends. She comes back from the trip on Saturday and things definitely felt more off than they used to. She felt even more distant and came to me crying and wanting to talk. We probably had one of the best conversations about our relationship that day with us understanding each other's points of view and where the both of us could put in some work to moving forward with the relationship. She did bring up she had shared a bed with one of her male friends but in a platonic way. After that conversations things were by no mean fixed or in happy land and she went to stay the night with her friend. Yesterday she confronts me and tells me she has something to tell me. While on her trip she made out and blew one of her friends but never told me that when we had our conversation Saturday night. She only told me a partial truth of sleeping in the same bed as him. I love her and all Saturday night and during the day Sunday I felt like shit and hoped her and I could move forward with our relationship, but with this new information, I'm no longer sure. She's back to staying with her friend as I told her to figure out what she wants because it doesn't look like she wants me if she's willing to cheat. My question for this sub is how/if am I supposed to forgive her? This is one of her friends from her main circle. How am I supposed to show my face to her friends or her family? Is there any way that trust can be rebuilt? Edit: I want to add that she said they were both drunk. I know that should not change things but I would like to be transparent on the details and not leave anything out.",0

It’s been a month and I already found another guy and we are in a relationship.

He told me that guys are very possessive and he wants to still be in my life. That I need him to make me happy. He called me one day when I posted that I was with my new boyfriend. He called non stop and said it was an emergency. I ignored him and he showed up to my house. I am under the process of getting a restraining order. He acted like he didn’t care our whole relationship yet now he’s acting like this. How should I handle him? Why is he doing this now if he cheated the whole time?",0

60,"GF(30) cheated on me(30M) and is pregnantIn order for this story to make sense, I'm going to have to give you a little background. My girlfriend and I have been together for years. She works in PR, but her last job, though the pay was pretty good, had no room for growth. She was there for probably 4 1/2-5 years and she quit a little over a year ago because our son was due in mid December and she thought it would give her the perfect amount of time to bond with him and find the ""perfect"" job. After about three months, I noticed she's not really happy staying at home and interviews she has gone on for higher level jobs (executive, etc) aren't really going well. So I encourage her to take apply for a job at a place relatively close to our house, making a lot less money, but a ton of growth potential. She reluctantly agrees and gets offered the job on the spot. She comes home and tells me she still isn't sure this is the right place for her and she thinks it's a step back. Again, I encourage her until she finally takes the job. She ends up loving the job. She made new work friends right away and over time, they became real friends. One of them is a 24 year old named Steve (not his real name). They'd call and text each other a lot (same with several of her other work friends), they had a work group chat, would hang out some weekend nights for dinner and drinks (all her co workers who were friends). About four months ago, she starts getting really distant and weird. I tried to talk to her about it, but she tells me it's just work and she has a lot on her plate. We had sex with each other once in the last five months. I try to support her, but it ends up backfiring in my face and causing arguments about petty stupid stuff. Our son's first birthday was right before Christmas. We celebrated it the Sunday after. She again is weird, moody and distant. She ruined his birthday. All our friends and family were there. She ends up leaving telling me I'm hounding her and she needs air. I don't know what to do at this point. I let her go. I tried calling and texting her for hours. Nothing. Her parents and siblings. Same thing. No one can get a hold of her. Finally at around 11 pm (this all happened around 3-4ish in the afternoon) she comes home and tells me it's just not working out anymore. I'm dumbfounded and start asking questions. She again tells me it's all my fault and I'm making her crazy and this just isn't working and she's going to her parents for a while. So she leaves. I let her go figuring she needs time to cool off. I'm able to figure out from talking to her mom, she's not really there. The next day I call and text her many times throughout the day and hear nothing. At this point, in my mind I think something is going on, but I don't think it's cheating. I think she's either in danger or having a break down. About a week passes with every little interaction from her, just to drop the baby off with her mom so she can see him because she doesn't want to see me. I tell her parents I'm worried about her and think something is going on and they agree. I'm assuming she told them before telling me, but long story short after about two weeks of this crazy stuff going on, she agrees to meet me at a coffee shop. I immediately ask her if she's ok and if she needs help. She proceeds to tell me, she's been sleeping with Steve for months and she's pregnant. I was in complete shock, walked out, and cried in my car. It's been several weeks and I still feeling completely devastated by this and I think she's living with him. I'm trying to co parent with her, but I hate her. I don't want our son in his apartment. I know I need to contact a lawyer, but this is all so new to me. Anyone have advice? I'm hoping this is clear. I'm crying as I write this, but it also feels good to get everything off my chest. So if you have any follow up questions, I'll answer to the best of my ability. Also, sorry this is so long. **TL;DR: Girlfriend cheated on me and is pregnant by her co-worker. I don't know what to do next. We have a one year old.** &#x200B; Edit: I'm overwhelmed with support. Thank you for the tips and love. It means a lot to me and is making this bad situation a tiny bit better.",0
61,"*UPDATE My(51M) ex-wife(50F) who cheated on me and lied to destroy me in divorce just died of cancer, and my 2 girls are upset with me because I refused to sit in the family and friends section during the funeral with my ex-wife's family who hid her infidelity and helped her lie against me in courtHello. Earlier this week I posted, but my thread was eventually deleted because I broke the rules for my name for this sub so I had to make a new account with the ThrowRA prefix. Below I have included the entire text from my previous post as a recap. I apologize to the Mods for not reading the rules thoroughly before posting. As far as an update, I received very good advice from many people here to wait at least a few weeks, and possibly even a few months before I explain to my girls why I had so much difficulty sitting with their mothers family at her funeral. Looking back at it, this is the obvious course of action, but when my girls confronted me about it, a flood of emotions came back and sort of short circuited my thinking a bit. I basically sat down with them this weekend and told them ultimately I may have been wrong, but I have very good reasons for why I felt that way and that after things have calmed down and everyone is done mourning their mother, we'll have a good long talk why I felt the way I did. They understood and there was no further drama after that. It may be a while but many people asked me to update them after I explain everything to my daughters, and I will. But it may be a couple of months. Thank you for your support and help. Previous thread > 15 years ago, my wife completely betrayed me and began an affair with a childhood friend of mine. When I found out and confronted her, I came to realize she had been preparing to divorce me for a very long time. She had all her ducks in a row and completely railroaded me. After I confronted her, she left to stay with her family. During that time she withdrew all the money from our joint accounts and took all the emergency cash and valuables we had in the home safe. While I was spending the week trying to negotiate with her to go to a marriage counselor, she was leading me on while simultaneously hiring a lawyer and filing for divorce. > >I was shortly served papers and removed from the family home. She had claimed domestic abuse not only against her but against my 2 daughters as well. This was a complete lie. The police only allowed me to take my personal papers, a bag full of clothes, and my car. > >I was completely decimated in the divorce. I lost a portion of my retirement, she got the house and all our assets other than my car, motorcycle and my personal effects that were still at the house. On top of this I had to pay spousal support for 10 years and child support until the girls were 18. I lost custody of the girls and was given supervised visitation for a year and then after that I was only able to get them one weekend a month, and then for a couple of weeks in the summer, and no holidays. And she only agreed to let me see the girls in this capacity if I agreed to everything else above. > >I spent 2 dark years living in my parents basement trying to recover both financially and mentally. Had it not been for the support of my family and friends I might have ended it. It took another 5 years to save enough money to get out of the efficiency apartment I was living in and into a small town home. My relationships with women were damaged for years after this, as I had severe trust issues and would never commit to anyone. It has only been recently that I have been able to work past these issues and give my most recent girlfriend the trust and love she deserves. No body is perfect. I wasn't the perfect husband. But I was loyal, kind, and worked hard to provide for my family. I in no way deserved to be destroyed like this. > >During the divorce her family had lied on her behalf claiming they had seen me fly off into rages, which was complete bullshit. I also found out in the following years they knew she was cheating with my friend for at least a year before the divorce. They, especially her mother hid all this from me, and helped to destroy my reputation. I lost almost all my longtime friends because of the lies they spread. > >Fast forward 15 years and my ex-wife has died of pancreatic cancer. Out of respect for my 2 girls I attended the funeral, but I could not bring myself to sit up front in the family and friends section. I would have had to sit among people who had betrayed me and destroyed my life and my family and who never apologized or tried to make amends. I quietly sat in the very back near the door, and when the time came I passed the coffin, said goodbye, and forgave her. Now my girls are upset with me that I refused to sit with them with the rest of the family. They are claiming I was being petty. My girls do no know the extent to which their mother and grandparents harmed me. I swallowed all of it to protect them and their childhoods. > >But now I feel I have the right to defend my honor and position. My girls are adults now with their own families, and are mature enough to understand I should hope. I need advice on how to approach the subject with them both in such a way that I can explain myself without hurting them. I still have all the evidence and access to witnesses that prove their mother and her family were cheating on me and was viciously planning on wrecking my life. The friend of mine who my ex-wife was cheating with even came to me begging for forgiveness many years later. I don't want my girls to live the rest of their lives hating their mothers memory or their grandparents, but I also don't deserve to continue to be questioned and criticized when I am so standoffish when it comes to what happened to me in my past.",0

63,"GF [24F] cheated on me [25M] with a friend [30M] whilst we were on holiday and saw him afterwards behind my back. What do I do?**EDIT:** Please read the update at the bottom of this post before telling me to leave her. I have, as of yesterday evening. Hi folks, I'll try not to ramble too much but hard to figure out what to do right now. Please take the time to read the whole thing. I really need some advice and I don't know who I can actually speak to. Started writing this on Sunday after this started to unravel. I'd always told myself that I would never give a cheat a second chance but its a lot easier said than done. On Sunday my girlfriend of almost 4 years admitted to sleeping with a friend of ours whilst a dozen of us were on a group holiday. He wasn't a close friend at all, in fact it was only the second time we met him (first time was on another holiday two years ago through the same friendship group) GF and I had a good relationship I think. I'm quite a tactile and affectionate person, GF isn't so much as she has low self-esteem issues and doesn't often feel confident expressing herself like that. She is confident and outgoing with friends she just doesn't see what people see in her. The holiday was around three weeks ago. She'd been quite quiet and mopey over the last few weeks and we hadn't had sex at all. I'd kind of chalked it up to January blues and switching contraceptive pill. On Sunday we had sex for the first time in a month but I could tell she wasn't happy afterwards. I confronted her and asked her what was wrong. After a bit of coercing, she initially said that she kissed this guy whilst on our holiday. When I asked her if that's all they did, she said no and admitted to sleeping with him. She also confessed to kissing him again the following night. I was in shock and didn't really know how to react or feel. For the rest of the evening, GF was very honest with anything I asked her, which I appreciated. The evening in question that started it, she had been very drunk. I don't use that as an excuse and neither does she. We're firm believers that whilst drink reduces inhibition, you're still in control of the choices you make. We'd got back from a night out and as we were walking up to our Airbnb as a group, he kissed her. Apparently it was fairly brief and no one saw. We all went up the flat and carried on partying for a bit. At some point they went and had sex in one of the bathrooms. It wasn't immediately after getting into the flat. I don't know who initiated that, I didn't ask. This is extremely hurtful, but in some ways the following evening was more hurtful. I'd picked up some very flirty vibes from him towards her over the previous couple of days. He's single, good lucking and in your face. My GF is very attractive and doesn't realise it, so I'm used to guys flirting with her. But he was sitting next to her whenever we went to a bar etc. I quietly spoke to her on the following night out (far more sober), saying that I was picking up strong vibes from him and that she should maybe put some distance between them. I felt guilty even saying it, I'm not a jealous guy but I knew he was interested (didn't know it was too late at this point though). She said OK, and didn't admit anything at this point, not even picking up on the vibe herself His best friend [30F] who we'd never met before had been quite flirty with me at the beginning of the trip (she didn't realise I was in a relationship initially) and my GF then spoke to me about this and I agreed that I picked up that vibe from her. I'd been feeling guilty over the previous couple of days for being flattered by the attention as the female friend was also very attractive and my own self-esteem isn't that great. Anyway, later that evening we all wanted to find a takeaway and the group (about 12 of us) split up a bit to look for somewhere. I was drunker at that point and hadn't realised that GF had gone off with him, but wouldn't have been too concerned even if i had realised now that I'd spoken to her about it. Whilst they were away from the rest of the group, they kissed again down a side street. That really pisses me off. To go and do that when she was far more sober and I'd already voiced my concerns was a slap in the face. GF admitted she hadn't decided before Sunday whether to tell me or not, wondering if she could just move on if she kept it a secret (context will follow) but couldn't lie to me when I put her on the spot by asking what was wrong. She's said that she didn't do it because anything was lacking from our relationship (she described me as perfect and the best thing to ever happen to her), it was just selfishness that arose from feeling validated from his attentions when she doesn't see herself as being desirable. I'm not sure that our relationship not being the cause actually makes me feel better. If there was an issue between us, at least there's something there to work on and resolve. I'm also not sure I believe her anyway. She has a bit of a fucked up history and I'm not sure she quite realised it until we spoke this evening about why this happened. She doesn't use any of them as excuses, for which I'm grateful. I told her that whether we try to make this work or not, she needs counselling/therapy. I think collectively those issues have damaged her more than she realised and may well have contributed to her deciding to fuck things up so much. However, the following morning I pushed for more details about what contact they've had since then. She admitted that they had been sexting, trading nudes (she's not sent me a nude in years as she's quite self-conscious) and that they'd been getting to know each other, which starts to sound more like emotional cheating too. She also confessed that the weekend after NYE, she spent the night with him in his home city under the pretense of seeing an old school friend. She couldn't even promise to cut him off whilst we work this out. The idea that if I hadn't put her on the spot she might not have told me so that she could ""figure it out for herself"" in her words but would most likely have kept seeing him makes me feel physically sick. In a month we were due to go on a night out in another city with a group of friends including this guy. It would have been her birthday on that weekend. Again, the idea that we would have taken a train with him up to a night out and she most likely would have tried to find an opportunity to hook up with him again behind my back makes me feel sick, humiliated and angry. I love her and I did believe that she was truly sorry and loves me too, until she couldn't commit to cutting him off. When I got upset that really pushed her over the edge. In her own words, she's a person who likes to plan and be in control but she never thought out the consequences in this situation and never meant to hurt me. I don't have any close friends and the vast majority of my friends are all part of this same social circle. She asked me that if it doesn't work out, would we still be able to be friends and share the same group of friends who we all met through a uni club. I said I don't know, but I'm not giving them up when she chose to do this and I introduced her to them. I've spent the last two nights at my mum's. I'll be seeing her again this evening to talk. I don't know what she will say, but anything short of a heartfelt 100% dedication to making it work won't be enough, if I even choose to accept it. I don't think she'll be able to make that commitment. If I cant be with her, I want to make her realise how much pain she's caused and the consequences of her actions and that shit like this will prevent her ever having a stable long term relationship. I love her and I want her to be happy, despite my anger and sadness. **TL;DR** GF cheated on me and I then found out it continued into an 'affair' which I'm not convinced she ever would have told me about. I don't think she even realises the betrayal she's caused. Can we make this work and if not, how do I at least help her to be more mature and responsible in the future? **EDIT:** Thank you all for the very direct and blunt advice. When I posted this this morning, I was feeling sad and self pitying but was trying to tell myself that maybe we stood a chance. I realise now that there is no chance of reconciliation after her refusal to stop contacting him. I will be seeing her this evening and finishing this. It will be difficult as our flat is rented in both our names until june/July and neither can afford it without the other really, but I'll figure that out. If anyone else has any more advice or suggestions, please keep them coming. **UPDATE:** So I have broken up with her. We have a lot to sort out because of our shared flat, but I'm glad that it's been said. Now I can try and begin the healing process",0
64,"Wife cheated on me with her guy friendSo my job and some of my hobbies require me to travel, 6-7 weekends a year. This past weekend i was gone for work, came home and something was off. Sex died immediately after we got married, anyways opening her phone to turn on the google lights, i see a list, of her sexual partners. Which are more partners than shes told me, ok ok, whatever not concerned. So i check out her safari history, adultery shows up, going back to the “list” one guy shes adamantly told me shes never slept with. So i check out his text message to my wife. At 12:05 AM he sends her an address, im not dumb here. My hearts coming out of my chest Ok ok, i put the phone down. I wake up my wife and tell her i had a horrible dream she cheated on me. She doesn’t answer at first but 15 minutes later reassures me, shes never cheated. She falls back asleep, i check her google maps, theres the address. Check the text messages, she deleted it and the list. I feel awful going through my wifes phone but im here now, im hurt, what do I do.",0
65,"I did it!! I got over my 8-year girlfriend after she cheated on me!! I feel amazing!This sub was such a safe haven for me over this period of time, but I can finally say that the pain is gone. ITS OVER. I am overcome with thankfulness. I never thought I’d be okay. But the last bit of feelings seem to have finally sorted themselves out. Note: I was not able to do this while still holding my positive regard for my ex. She treated me pretty poorly, and facing this helped me work through my breakup and process my feelings. I don’t personally think exes should be friends if the relationship was intense and strong at one point. That’s just me, though. And, guys, this took me NINE months. Like almost an entire year to let this go. So bear that in mind when you’re feeling hopeless.",0
66,"My husband cheated on me with a friend of mineI really don’t have anything else to say. I am dealing with a million emotions and now I have to go to work and pretend I’m ok. I know I have to end this relationship, I’m really sick about it. I haven’t reached the point of heartbreak yet and that scares me; I still don’t believe it. Waiting for him to tell me the truth felt like I was bracing being shot in the chest. Now that I know I’m numb. EDIT: Thank you everyone for your encouraging words you guys helped me get thru this work day. I’m off work now and being home is honestly the hardest part. I’m going to curl in a ball and possibly eat a whole pizza pie and tomorrow I plan on removing everything that is his or remotely represents “us”.

68,"Wife cheated on me, is threatening me, I feel lost.I caught my wife lying about being somewhere when she was actually at a hotel. She’s threatening me with divorce if we don’t open our relationship. We have a two year old daughter. I just graduated college and all of my plans for graduation have fallen apart, I’ve been rejected from every fellowship I’ve applied to and interviewed for. I had a surgery two years ago that still is bothering me with complications. I can’t tell my wife, the only person I used to talk to about my depression or if I’m feeling suicidal. I’m so tired of feeling this way. I’m in so much pain all of the time. I feel completely and utterly humiliated. I just want the pain to stop. Please help me. I can’t take this anymore. Please. I don’t know what to do. Fuck. I don’t want to lose my daughter. I love her so much. I’m just so lonely, scared, and hurt. I just want the pain to stop. I don’t want to deal with this pain anymore. Is there a point when it’s okay to stop? I loved my wife so much, she was everything to me. I feel so broken. Edit: I have read every single comment on my post, and deeply appreciate all of your support. You’re all channeling the anger I’ve been suppressing for a few weeks now. My family is really well connected in the legal community, I’m just hesitant to pull the trigger and start asking for contacts. Word spreads pretty quick and I’m not sure I’m ready for everyone to know right now.

69,"Just found out that my wife and mother of my 2 children cheated on me.I found a wayward text on her phone, and I put all of the pieces together. She’s been acting weird since last summer, and now I know why. Making up “excuses” to be gone after 7-8 PM: Needing to return a library book, needed to go grocery shopping and take 2 hours, being at the gym from 8 PM to 11 PM (no one works out for that long!), going over her “parent’s house”, etc. There’s probably more that I’m forgetting. It wasn’t just at night either. Anyways, she actually admitted some things to me. She had sex with someone that I don’t know named “R”. Don’t know his full name. Claims it happened “once”. Ha, sure. I have no idea who this person could be. She’s never dated anyone whose name starts with an R that I’m aware of. It’s driving me crazy, but I guess it doesn’t matter at the end. Her reasonings were brutal: •Not enough sex, affection and “intimacy” from me. I’m not a touchy feely person, so she cheats. •Bored with her life, marriage and motherhood. Don’t get that one? At all? She has an amazing life! •I don’t make her finish ever, apparently. I don’t listen to her when she tells me what she wants in bed. •Bad sex life. Makes me feel terrific. I don’t know. Not enough reasons to cheat, IMO. I WOULD NEVER CHEAT ON HER. I’ve never even thought about it, except maybe a random time with a coworker (nothing happened, even though it could have). This was just a vent, so I’m rambling. Not sure if I can move past this, but we have 2 young kids together.",0
70,"GF [33F] cheated on me [33M] after 9+ years, because I was unable to show love or affection. In need for advice. I've been living together with my girlfriend for almost 6 years now. We've been together for over 9 years and have been through some difficult times and stuff in our lives together. We're both 33. At the beginning, I was the one working while she finished her last two semesters of studies. After that, we both worked and lived a pretty happy relationship together.Ever since childhood, however, I have been unable to express and show my love. Unfortunately - also towards her. I would not be able to return the love she sent out toward me. I neglected her, although I felt I was a prisoner in my own mind. One side of me could see her suffering for not returning the love she sent out to me, and the other side was trying to protect myself from being hurt again, as I had been hurt in the past. (Although, as I've mentioned, we lived a very healthy relationship for about 3-4 years or so.) Marriage was always something which I knew she wanted, but my point of view in regard to marriages hasn't been the best (Went through a divorce as a kid, when my mum left her second husband and ever since felt that it was something I needed to stay away from). Apparently I ignored her over such a long period of time, that I neglected her completely. Only did, what was good for me and not necessarily for us. I always felt love for her, but could never show or express it. About two months ago, she confessed to me, that she has been cheating on me with somebody. I told her, that we could work it out. Even went on vacation together for 5 days and had one of the most harmonic vacations in a long time - wonderful sex every day and evening - it was great. Problem is, I've been studying for 1.5 years and we agreed that she support me through my studies. So now I'm seeing myself in this situation, where I have to live with her in the same flat, and have to see her go every weekend, so she can stay with the other guy. I cook for us every second day and keep the house clean, go grocery shopping and all that. I've been working on myself as a person over the last weeks and realize, that it's a process, that will take more time but I also don't want to lose her. Yesterday she told me, that in the end her reason will win in the end, and that she will return eventually. She always expresses more attraction towards me, whenever I signal her, that I'm over her and show her the cold shoulder... I don't have the finances for moving out - I can barely support myself while living together with her. Will NC help me in this situation? What shall I do? I'm absolutely clueless... TL; DR: Me \[33M\] been in a relationship with my gf \[33F\] for 9+ years. She cheated on me, because she was looking for love, caring and affection, I couldn't express or show. I don't want to give up on it all, what should I do?",0
71,"My girlfriend cheated on me two days before we became “official”Just found this out today, a few hours ago. Totally heartbroken and don’t really know what to think. Basically I decided to date a girl I’ve known and had a crush on for the past decade. We grew up and we were super close. Our family’s were close as well. Last year we decided to date and we broke up due to wrong timing for the both of us. This year we decided to try again. I have been very good at protecting my energy and really careful on who I catch feelings for. And she’s a girl that I genuinely loved and cared about. Still do. But with her I felt a connection that I haven’t had with no one else ever in my life, probably due to all the history her and I have. So I decided to follow my heart and chase her. We had been talking for months before we made things official. We were basically in a relationship without the title. She said she was committed and so was I, things were perfect. On New Years she came over to my apartment and spent the night with me, we had sex and decided it was time to make things official and put that title on it. But today she told me she slept with someone else two days before we did that. The dude that she slept with is an ex type figure, but not really. He was just a fuckboy that viewed her as a sex object, and she even knew that. But she has an “emotional attachment” towards him. I was aware of him the entire time her and I were talking and she told me they don’t talk and she’s focused on me. A week before they slept together, I even mentioned something about it bothering me she still has him added as a friend on Snapchat, and she said she’ll remove him. But she didn’t. It was a lie. She told me she asked all her friends if she’s a shitty person for sleeping with someone else when her and I had a thing going on. They said no because technically she was “single” when she did it. Which yes we were technically single but at the same time, we weren’t. She wanted me to stay loyal to her and to act as if we were in a relationship and she’d do the same. Like I said we were basically in a relationship without the title. Should I drop her off completely or get over it and still be with her because yes, she did it when we were still “single” Thank you for taking the time to read this and responding. I just feel like I need to vent cause the pain in my heart won’t end",0
72,"My First Serious GF cheated on me in her first DAY of collegeSo this is the story of my first GF which happened to be in high school. We met my freshman year while she was a senior and I was a freshman. We eventually started having sex and our relationship became somewhat fueled on sex. (Pretty sure she was a nympho) Anyways, throughout our entire relationship she may or may not have slept/sent nudes to guys, to this day I don't know if she did or not tbh. So basically the relationship was toxic and we got to the point where she was going to college. I wanted to break it off because I knew she would cheat but I ended up not doing it because she convinced me that shed stay faithful and loyal. And being a dumbass 15 year old I believed her. Anyways I went to help her move in and she seemed okay, a little sad that we wouldn't be able to see each other anymore (keep in mind we had spent the whole summer together like all day everyday). I got back home and we FaceTimed she again seemed fine, I told her that I loved her and that id see her in the morning. &#x200B; The cheating: I woke up in the middle of the night to a snap from her I opened it up and it just said ""Im so sorry"" me being confused I immediately factetimed her. My calls didn't go through. I tried again and like on the fifth time she picked up. She picked up and I heard loud music and another guys voice. She tried to play it off and I, now at this point crying, asked her if she had cheated on me and she said she had and then I heard the guys voice although it be muffled. She was obviously drunk or high but she hadn't hung up the call... pretty soon she was moaning loudly and saying shit like harder and cum in me. I was scarred and still have like PTSD from it. I later found out she had been past around and fucked in the ass by like an entire frat party from one of her friends. &#x200B; Now: Im 17 now and a junior in high school. I have a new GF, and all seems to be well. I still have ptsd from that night and I have to say that it changed me and desensitized me. I think overall it made it better. Im still confused though. on her motives. Why did she do it? Im not being egocentric but I was the best bf she had ever had. Im not ""small"" by any means and our sex was great. I just don't understand why.",0

She started speaking to her in September. My girlfriend has lied repeatedly, pretending to see friends, all the whilst I have seen proof on social media of otherwise.

76,"Do you think he cheated on me? Am I paranoid? Did I make the right choice? I left him and I regret it, help!It’s kind of a long story so I’ll simplify it as much as possible. I would love to hear everyone’s opinions and insight on this. A month ago I saw a cum stain on his shirt, it could have been from me however he weren’t having frequent sex and when we do typically sits before bed and he doesn’t wear shirts- it led me to look into his boxers and a few had cum stains on the front inside of them! He dismissed the shirt saying it was from me and he had pulled it out of the dirty laundry, I dropped it and never brought up the boxers. A few weeks ago I caught my boyfriend hanging out with a girl in the loft he works out of (he’s a designer) this girl posted videos of herself wearing his pieces and also took videos of pieces he was working on. She looks kind of like a party girl, very loose posts pictures with men often and also seems to be a rapper groupie ( the type of girl who takes pictures with her middle finger up holding a bottle of patron or a blunt and posts it on IG). The day I saw it I initially confronted him, he said he did not cheat on me and it was innocent. I have an 8 year old son that he’s helped me raise, his father passed away when he was 4 so my boyfriend is all he’s ever known as a father, I also pay majority of the bills, I work very hard and I own two cars- one of which he drives because he does not have the money to afford his own considering he makes 15,000 a year if he’s lucky. The night he hung out with her he was watching my son while I worked and dropped my son off to his sister at 7pm to go do some “work” at the loft, when I was texting him regarding money issues on his end, he told me to leave him alone because I’m annoying and distracting him from his work. I tried to drop the situation with the girl and get past it but the story of how she got there in the first place seemed to change, first he said he doesn’t even know her she came with one of his friends, then it was she’s an old friend direct messaged me on Instagram and came by to see my work and lastly he said they ran into each other in person and she came by to see his work. He apologized told me he loved me and wouldnt cheat on me, he said he shouldn’t have had her at the loft. A week of thinking about how I knew something wasn’t right and I had a bad gut feeling like he’s lying to me because from what it looks like he’s known her since 2015. I asked him finally to show me the conversation that took place between them before she came to his house, he refused to show me it. He claimed “it was not an ill minded conversation I don’t need to show you”. I thought about the situation for a week before making any firm choices. I asked multiple times to please see the conversation. Finally I gave him an ultimatum because not only was this girl an issue I was having but his lack of money has been an issue along with his lax lifestyle. I told him either show me the conversation or you have to move out, even if he did cheat I would rather move forward knowing the truth.He refused to show the conversation. I did not cave I told him he still had to leave, he picked his things, gave up on our relationship and called an Uber. Yesterday we were still sharing locations on our iPhone and he stopped sharing his, I didn’t want to un share mine because I wanted him to watch me. I figured my ex would look at my location and I was hoping he would obsess over the fact that I wasn’t home. He was very controlling and didn’t like when I went out or hung out with anyone. The next morning I unshared my location with my ex. Today I texted him to see how he’s doing because I don’t think he took the breakup well either, and he is completely ignorining me. I love him so much. I just want him to understand what I’m going through and how I feel... My son keeps asking if he’s coming home or if he will see him again. I’ve been texting him and asking him why he’s ignoring me when he is the one who caused this whole situation to unfold. I want him to grow up and change because I know he loves me, my son and our dog. I know he’s mad because I kicked him out however I feel I had no choice, I needed to put my foot down because he doesn’t seem to respect me. If you weren’t cheating wouldn’t you just show the conversation? What do I do?",0
77,"Husband cheated on me with a prostituteI need your support and wisdom. We are in our thirties. Dated for 11 years and married for 2. On Feb 5, after I attended my evening class, my husband told me that he cheated on me several hours ago with a prostitute. I have cross posted because I need more support...I don’t know what to do We haven’t had sex lately, and I wondered why he didn’t why but he’s just been gaming nonstop after work everyday. He says he is stressed at work and gaming helps him destress. I did catch him once masturbating to porn a year ago, and in retrospect I realize I should’ve seen that as a red flag then. Back then he told me that even though he watches porn he reassured me that he would never “cross the line.” Well, here we are. He says there is “no strings attached” because she’s a prostitute and it’s his “first time.” He is begging for me to give him a chance to make things right. I don’t have the strength yet to even ask him how long this has been going on. He says he has “resisted temptation” for many weeks prior so even though the physical cheating happened on Feb 5, the emotional cheating (sexting probably and who knows what else) happened way before. I’ve lived more than a third of my life with him. I’m just very lost. I’ve just been crying all day yesterday. I didn’t eat a thing because I had no appetite. He made me eat something as he took a day off yesterday to apologize and whatever. He was my best friend. And he just single-handedly destroyed our marriage with his selfishness and greed and lust. We will get STI testing. He says he wants to do it together so he can “prove” to me he’s clean. I, if not us both, will definitely need therapy. I just don’t know where to go from here. I don’t even know what I want. Reassurance that you’ve survived this and is now working out? Wisdom to leave now before he does it again? We have no kids so it will be a relatively “easy” divorce. But I can’t even think about divorce yet. I can barely process what happened to my life and my marriage overnight. Please help me...",0

80,"I (27F) just found out that my (28M) husband cheated on me with our friends wife - do I tell her husband what happened?Basically the title but there is a little backstory. My husband and I got married three years ago and I just found out he has been cheating on me with our college/close friends wife for about a year. After graduating University our friend group of 7 stayed in the city and would often see each other 2/3x a month. We all go to the same church and that's where this all started. He and I are over, already filing for divorce - I know that he has not told her or her husband and is trying to keep it under wraps. We are keeping the divorce proceedings to ourselves but our friends already have figured things are going downhill for us and we are splitting but do not know the reason. The girl that he cheated with recently married a year ago to a abusive prick - he does not deserve to be cheated on with but that does not excuse his actions. I am fairly close friends with her and have gotten to know her the past two years pretty well. She and my (exish)husband have stayed close because they sing in church together, lead church groups and occasionally hangout for coffee and stuff like that. I have heard from this girl about her abusive husband and how he treats her - its totally unacceptable and I am concerned for her safety when he does find out. From what I have heard from her and from what she has told our girl/friend group he puts holes in the walls when hes angry, abuses their dog, calls her names, is super controlling, has had many fights with her for hanging out with other men, penetrates her in her sleep and is just an asshole. On one hand its her life and I/our friend group have been telling her to divorce her husband for the pas six months but, ""she cant see her life without him,"" so she can figure stuff out on her own without me - cause its not my problem. On the other hand her husband should know that she was unfaithful as I know that would be a dealbreaker for him as he is a BibleThumper. But I am concerned for her safety - I know that this will be a lot worse and that he will hurt her if he finds out much after the fact. Do I tell him straight up? Do I do it anonymous? Or do I just walk away? Eventually it will all come out in their marriage but I am getting out of all of it anyways but am very concerned for her safety.",0

He had female friends he would hang out with a lot, and I didn't mind because he's always only had female friends. He gets along better with them. I was a bit insecure because one of them he used to be in love with, but I trusted him, so I didn't let it bother me too much. Yesterday out of the blue he tells me that he's fallen out of love with me. I'm in shock. I go to hang out with the girl who he used to be in love with because she invited me over to comfort me (she's been a good friend of mine for a while). While there she told me that 3 days before he had broken up with me, he had told her he has feelings for her. I was mortified. I never would've seen it coming. It made her incredibly uncomfortable and he texted her an apology the next day (he slept in her living room that night, they would have sleepovers sometimes), and then 3 days later he ended things with me. When he broke up with me, he was sobbing. I have never seen this boy cry in the 2 years I've been with him, and he kept saying that he didn't want to lose me as a friend.

On one had it seems dumb to end a marriage over a drunken kiss, but it’s never just that she says sometimes she feels trapped and wonders what her life would be like if she didn’t settle down so young. I have been saving and working nonstop since I was 14 I’ve never taken more than 10 days off work. I have managed to acquire a decent amount of assets for a man my age and now I feel pressured to divorce now because at this point she won’t get anything. Even if I want to work through this I don’t know if I can gamble with that any longer. She seems genuinely remorseful and has been doing the whole sad puppy routine. The icing on the cake is that she claims she doesn’t like to make out and we rarely kiss more than lightly but she’s going to mug down with a stranger? Our sex is a few times a week but I always initiate. I don’t feel desired, I know she loves me as a husband as a partner as a father to our kid. But as a lover? I’m having my doubts and I’m starting to ask myself if that’s true can it be fixed ? You can’t negotiate desire. And how is she ever going to stop wondering what she missed out on? I’m perfectly capable of finding someone who wants me on all levels not just some. I just don’t know if Kim ready to nuke our whole family yet.",0
87,"My husband cheated on me before he knew me ?? My husband told me that when we first met that he felt that we had a past life together and he felt it immediately. He never really gave me details as to why he felt this way outside of saying he just felt a really strong connection and that we are soulmates etc etc Recently he has told me that any time he had thought about a past relationship he feels guilty for having been in it as if he was cheating on me with these women.. many many years before he ever even knew I existed. It doesn't eat away at him or anything, just enough to feel a little bad and make him believe we've loved each other before . Has anyone else ever experienced something like this ?",0
88,"Boyfriend has cheated on me our entire relationshipHi guys &#x200B; I have posted on previous groups, but this group seems more active and there's more one on one talking about your issue. &#x200B; My boyfriend and I met 2 years ago, and we have been dating approximately a year and 5 months. He is 22 and I am 24. So the thing is he keeps saying he never cheated, because he never kissed someone or slept with them. &#x200B; But he has emotional affairs and it hurts me so so much more.... &#x200B; I used to stay in a different town and we would see each other weekends, during this time he constantly went on dates (took a girl to a bar like every other night) he has never taken me for a drink at a bar in the 2 years we have been together... it seems this girl actually left him because they have not spoken since June 2019, &#x200B; I found out about all of this because he logged onto whatsapp web on the laptop and forgot to log off. This was 30 October 2019 when I found out about everything, I had moved in with him a month before , on the 1st of September as I found a amazing job in the town he stays in. So I also helped him buy a motorcycle,i pay half the installment and he pays the other half... and he would use this BMW Bike to take the girls on dates and for rides. Like I actually paid to get cheated on. &#x200B; So besides the girl he went on dates with, a new girl started working at his job, he flirted with her on whatsapp every single day. In the mornings when i make him coffee, he would text her saying wish she was in bed with him. He would ask her if she wants to go ride on his motorcycle with him on saturdays. Constantly. Everyday. &#x200B; After i found out, i messaged her on facebook saying she can honestly have him. (he flirted with her and said sexual things , then she added me on facebook and would ""love"" all of our posts) &#x200B; She then has the audacity to message me back saying they are nothing more than colleagues. &#x200B; In the 3 months after I found out, things have been good sometimes, bad others and horrible most of the time. I cannot forgive him. This girl he works with still continues to like all his Facebook posts, [every.single.one] so I had feeling they are still talking and MADE him delete and block her on Facebook. &#x200B; I hate the fact that people think cheating is just sleeping together, the fact that he wanted to spend so much time with other women and leave me at home breaks my heart. &#x200B; And everytime i ask why did you do this to me? The answer is he does not know.. but he loves me. &#x200B; I am angry. I am sad. I am tired. I dont have family that I can talk to about this or move to, I have myself, and I really want to move out but everytime I try to look for a flat, he says please dont go, i changed. &#x200B; But i am unable to forgive someone for hurting me so bad. Especially since i never expected it. We were super happy (or atleast I was..) &#x200B; The fact that he would text this girl even after i fell asleep at nightt... or he would ignore me to talk to her... even if he did delete and block her, how can you do things like this and claim to love the other person. &#x200B; And how do you honestly heal after being stabbed in the back and lied to for a whole year.",0

I really don't care what he does: football, drama, art, ballet. I just want him to be happy. He just doesn't have that drive for life like a teenager should. He recently told my wife he hated her. He screamed it to her face after they argued over his grades. He's been slipping in school. He was a straight A student now down to Ds and Fs. I held her for hours after that. What happened to that happy little boy? What happened to my son? Why won't he let me in? I know I can help him. God, my poor boy. He has been bullied too for the way he dresses and acts. He's in his ""dark and brooding"" phase, but I hate that he takes it so seriously. I mean, I was into heavy metal and scared the crap out of my parents as well, but I never felt suicidal. I knew he was in trouble after the first bad self harm incident. He had apparently been cutting himself over the course of the past year and I caught him in the act recently. The fight, my God the fight. I brought him to a psychiatrist and the school therapist, but that only made him shut me out more. He just doesn't want help. I wish to God, how I wish, that I could've known what caused all this. According to the psychiatrist he has no reason to be as troubled as he is. They have found no root event in his childhood, they have found no chemical imbalance, they've found... Nothing. The darkness in his eyes now. God, the darkness. I made eye contact for the first time in months it felt, and it was like looking into the eyes of a shark. He is cold. Cold to us, cold to his friends, cold to everyone. I asked his friends about him and they feel the same as we do. The are worried. He has alienated himself and lashed out countlessly at his fellow peers. He has gotten beaten up by strangers and friends alike. I now wish we would have taken him out of school. He hates everyone and everything. He doesn't even do the normal actions of someone depressed. He eats his meals, he doesn't listen to depressing music(he's into heavy metal I think). He's not the way he used to be. He started to get this way around mid-freshman year, and it's been worsening ever since. He's a junior now, and I have no clue where to go for help. I just want the old Johnny back..",0

102,"My mother is suicidal and has said she is experiencing Insomnia for the last two years since being with a ''Narcissist'', she wakes up every hour during the night and can't take it anymore, how can i help her as a son??I don't usually fall on the high spectrum of having high empathy but if something will invoke empathy in me, it is dealing with siblings going through stuff. My mother thoroughly believes she has CPTSD and that's tough as it is not a recognized condition in DSM 5 to diagnose, my mother has a history of fleeing a war torn countries in which she was exposed to people dying and chaos, however this didn't really affect her once she migrated here in Australia, instead she was in a severely abusive relationship with a man she believes had Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD), Their relationship was present from 2013 to 2018, they were no contact for a year in 2019, but in 2020 he has tried getting into her life again and she has been scared to block his number as she fears retaliation. The abuse was emotional but he did try put his hands on her once, the abuse involved chronic pathological lying, targeted abuse, gaslighting. She also has history (possibly) of CSA, but she cannot remember all the details. Her father was a diagnosed Psychopath (ASPD). I can attest to his diagnosis because i also have lots of traits of NPD, ASPD, hinting a genetic component, (i also have a diagnosed Cluster B personality disorder myself) Her problem now which is affecting all areas of life is that she is waking up almost every hour. If she goes to bed at midnight she will open her eyes at 2:00 AM and will not fall asleep till 2:15 AM, she will than wake up again at 3:00 AM, than 5:00 AM, 6:30 AM, 7:00 AM, 9:00 AM, and from 9 she will toss and turn, she feels incredibly lethargic so she stays into bed till lunch. I can see her condition is very psychological, i don't think a pill would just help, i would love to get her to do CBT but English is limited, she talks to me about this every day and has told me to try find some advice online. She saw a doctor a few weeks ago and has been on Mirtazapine, she says it has helped her mood and anxiety issues, but her sleep is still very poor.

103,"So, my son is thinking about suicide because of bullying.What the fuck do I do. He is nine years old, telling me he's been having nearly daily thoughts of suicide lately, describing the thoughts as beyond his control. He says he feels perpetually bullied, targeted, and ""persecuted"" (which is a hot word, and with a schizophrenic family history, very alarming.) A lot of the bullying he tells me about doesnt add up to bullying in my eyes. Being called a nerd, being teased for not being athletic, people mispronouncing his name wrong... these things suck, but I tell him he needs to learn how to brush it off and keep going. He tells me he cant. He has been so tense, on edge, and angry lately, hes not the same kid he used to be. And he says he cant stop that anger anymore. Then, there are instances where kids are holding him down and stealing his glasses, shit like that is absolutely bullying, and I'm fighting wars to get it to stop. My kids not killing himself because his school is incompetent. Am I in the wrong here for telling him he needs to be less sensitive and brush off some or this stuff?

But I admittedly expect a lot of him, and am probably contributing to the issues. I'm trying to be more laid back. He has an anxiety, depression, and ADHD diagnosis. Hes been in an out of counseling with little progress. I am going to call a few places to try to get him in. I'm gonna work with him on mindfulness for anxiety and letting go. I'm gonna try to help him find something creative to do to let some of this out. What am I missing? Is there anything else i should be doing that I'm not?

112,"[TOMT] [MOVIE] [2000s] Horror/Psychological Thriller - Opening Scene is Son Killing Mom and Sister, then Committing Suicideok so - this has bothered me since childhood. pls prepare for a long dump of possibly unhelpful information. I was watching this movie on either Starz or HBO or a similar cable movie channel in the late 2000s, and it terrified me as a child. Opening scene takes place in the family’s house, where an older teen son (maybe long blonde hair?) with a tortured soul type vibe kills his mother and little sister. He leaves them on their knees with their wrists bound by wire in front of them, as if in prayer. Not sure if we actually see him kill them, or just their bodies, but I remember there being a shot of their mangled faces, like they died screaming or crying. I’m not positive, but I think the father was set up to be the protagonist of the movie and was maybe law enforcement or something? (not positive about that). either way i think he was rushing home because he knew something was wrong, and the movie cuts to that as the murder suicide plays out. I think there was a definite satanic/culty vibe to the son, and I’m pretty sure there is a pentagram made of blood drawn on the floorboards. the son then dramatically throws his body onto a sword in the center of the pentagram. this shot is filmed through a doorway, if i remember correctly. whole family is white. the scenes were all very gray and moody (fitting lol), and i think it was rainy or maybe just cloudy outside as this happened. there were definitely panning shots of the house interior, but i can’t remember what they were showing. i think the final scene i watched was of the devastated dad coming home to the bloody scene. being a smol and impressionable child, i promptly switched to the disney channel to nurse my psychological wounds, so i have no idea what the movie’s overarching plot or themes were. any help would be much appreciated because i’m beginning to wonder if this ever happened or if maybe i just had a freakishly graphic dream.",0

117,"This is a long story; Should my boyfriend move out?Ok Reddit, here we go. My boyfriend is in college and he grew up relatively well-off. He grew up moving every 1-2 years, has a couple expensive medical conditions and sometimes had to live in temporary housing like at a church. However, his (divorced) parents were able to buy him a used car in high school so he could get a job and he always had a place to stay. About a year into the relationship I could tell that he definitely had a narcissistic mother-- she would guilt trip him into everything, deny him access to things like therapy and jobs he liked that would give him more Independence and I found out later that as a kid she had convinced a doctor that he had ADHD in order to put him on medicine that essentially turned him into a zombie. Now that he was going to college he has been ok because he has been separated from her for most of the year. This summer (he's now 21) it's the last summer before graduating college and he is definitely more independent than when I met him-- he actually tells her no sometimes. Part of it is college and part of it is having someone around him and her constantly (me) and telling him it's ok to say no if he's uncomfortable doing something. About two weeks ago his mother asked him to pick her up at the airport at 9:30 pm, he said yes. The day of the pickup she said ""actually come at 11:30 pm, if that's too late I'll take an Uber"" he didn't feel comfortable driving that late at night and asked her to take an uber. She asked him to leave the keys in the garage and he did. Two days after that event she went after him (emotionally). She told him that she paid for his car (in high school) and for his insurance (which she said she would until he graduated so he could have to the car) and that that means that if she asks him to do something he is obligated to do it for him. For 30 minutes she put him down about not having a job (he's been trying and has applied to about 5 jobs a day since he's been home but no one wants to hire for just the summer). She told him he's paying the insurance in two weeks or she will sell his car. I understand wanting him to help with insurance but she knows he doesn't have a job yet. And $200 in two weeks is almost impossible without a job. She also told him that she was disgusted that she had to pay for his food and that he thinks it's ok to just lay in bed all day. (He's living with her and food has never been a problem before). He also does have a job writing but it's not what she wants him to do-- his major is writing. so he doesn't just lay in bed all day. She told him that he has shown no respect, curteousy or consideration for her (mentioned that he keeps the house in awful shape-- not true she gets very obsessive with cleaning and 3 crumbs on the floor is unironically a huge issues) and then she told him that she was done with him. Then she proceeded to try to verbally attack me (whether as another way of getting to him or just because she was upset with me too). I've dealt with my own narcissistic father and knew better than to respond to her and that stopped after about two sentences. After this, my boyfriend broke down. He didn't sleep at all and was very suicidal. I also found out that one of his friends had killed themselves that same weekend. This is when I told him that I think he has a narcissistic mother and showed him a video. He asked me to take him to a psych hospital/ ER because he didn't feel safe/ trust himself. I did but when he got there he felt bad because he's on his parents insurance and they would've been the ones to pay for it. Instead we cleaned his room and left for my house so he would be with dogs and my family, he would not be alone or with his mom and they could both have a little space. He asked me not to text her so I didn't. I guess he didn't either so she didn't know we left. She asks where we are about a day later and I end up responding because I feel like she should know. I tell her about the hospital and that we left and that he's still looking for jobs. I then tell her that I'm sorry we didn't let her know and that we figured she would want space. This is what she sent: ""Well at least I know (that we aren't home). This is unacceptable. Convenient that he chooses to blame it on the cost (going to the hospital). His father holds his insurance so he can deal with that if necessary (again hospital). All I have ever asked for is consideration and courtesy. Neither have been given."" (HELLO, YOUR SON IS SUICIDAL AND THIS IS HOW YOU REACT?!) ""Shame on you both."" ""If you will not be back here please let me know so I'll shut everything down. I'm leaving on Friday night. I no longer want to be in the condo I pay for. Congratulations."" I don't think she should speak to me (or anyone) this way but that's besides the point this isn't about me. I'm thinking maybe he should just move out? He might be able to live with his dad and he's almost out of college. Is his mom right, should he just get a job and stay home? I don't want to give him bad advice, but I also want to help. Side note: I don't ever want to deal with this woman again but I love her son so.... Tldr; son (my bf) doesn't pick his nmom up from airport and she berates him/ threatens him. We leave his house and it gets worse. He's suicidal and believes he's worthless because of her should he move out despite having any time to prepare to leave or could it make things worse?",0
118,My grandmother is suicidal after the death of her son My grandmother lost her only son last year and she’s been going down ever since.

When we keep asking her why she doesn’t eat and she says because she thinks of her son. It’s so bad now that she’s being admitted to the hospital every 3 days for low sugar.

119,"My ndad sometimes threatens to call the police and have me 5150'd when he's upset about anything at all in his life.Dad's upset about something at work? Suddenly he's threatening immediate eviction by the police via 5150. That's how my life is sometimes. Whenever I see my dad I always have to wonder ""is dad gonna do some crazy upsetting shit today?"" These days, 50% of the time the answer is yes. It's been getting milder as he's been getting older, but he still freaks out big time sometimes. Like a few weeks ago when he busted my door down in the middle of the night ""because you didn't take out the trash."" It's bizarre that the police empower him to harass me, and that they disregarded my statement that I was not suicidal. He donated a huge amount to the police years back, and apparently they now just let him have whatever he wants when he calls them up to do his bidding. 5150 is the California code for an involuntary 72 hour psychiatric hold. The point of it is basically to restrain people who might hurt themselves or somebody else. My dad realized all he has to do is call 911 and say ""my son is suicidal"" and shortly thereafter he's got the cops punishing me because he wills it. I don't need to be suicidal for that to occur. It's probably illegal, but that's what they've been doing. Kind of like ""swatting"", and my dad is the one that does this to me. So that sucks. This previous bogus hospitalization cost me $1200, the loss of the job I had at the time (can't use your phone in the mental hospital), and suspension of one of my constitutional rights. Plus it makes police act weird with me anytime I get a traffic ticket and they adapt behavior based on what the computer tells them when they look me up. ""5150 = Crazyperson"" seems to be their usual interpretation. It also seems to make them totally disregard whatever I'm saying even in situations where I'm calling for help in a situation totally unrelated to me, like noticing a semi truck swerving all over the road. I'll betcha they always look at the screen info and think ""great, it's a 5150 guy. fuck this guy."" They definitely talk like they're thinking something along those lines. My dad is the actual crazyperson in this family. He has gotten really drunk and threatened immediate eviction countless times, even when I was a little kid and he clearly had absolutely no socially-acceptable basis for his threat. I was always a good kid but it never mattered. My dad was just always angry and pretended like I was his problem. And still, after all these years, my nmom still pretends like everything's fine, and tries to get me to stop talking and talks over me and gives me incredibly terrible advice anytime I talk. My mom is disturbingly blind to my dad's insanity. When everyone else in the room is noticing my dad's ramping up in anger, my mom just smiles and genuinely does not notice at all. Then she acts surprised when he freaks out, and passively pretends like ""stahhhhp"" but not really. Unless he gets physically violent. That's ""where she draws the line"", ya know? Probably should count psychological abuse and the other crazy shit my dad does as part of the abuse. Because I definitely notice it and it screws me up in life on the daily. All of my siblings are in our 30s and we're still heavily dependent on my aging parents. All working for the family business and my dad's an asshole to all of us daily. Just recently, when my dad broke my door down in the middle of the night, a cop was acting like my dad's the good guy here and he gets to decide whatever he wants Maybe at 30-something we should be independent of our parents, right? Not when we've been trained to be babies well into adult ages. We're old infants. It's really sad how real that is. We never really grew up. Anytime we show a hint of individual capability or attempt to be independent from them, my parents fuck us up and bring us back to the ""just a start"" zone. Baby mode. We're permababies as long as we're here with them, and, shockingly, the local cops help to ensure that occurs. Bizarre, because last time my dad broke my door down, one of the cops acted like it's all my fault if I'm not living independently in one of the most expensive areas in the world with parents that routinely fuck up my mind to keep me as their narcissistic supply. He had no idea what was going on, and just invented his own explanation which he used as a basis for his choice of how to handle the situation. My parents are getting old, and if my mom dies first then I'm pretty certain my dad's going to liquidate the assets, go drink himself to death in Vegas, and leave us all to fend for ourselves. Something along those lines. So that'll be fun. The city where I live has an abnormally large concentration of narcissistic people, often bothering each other based on their conflicting selfish interests. I've traveled to other places. It's particularly bad here, and the past few months it's been looking like they've been ramping up in narcissistic rage towards each other. So that's concerning. Because I know what kind of crazy shit a raging narcissist can do. My dad used to be like that and still sometimes is. All of this is depressing to me, but I'm not suicidal. Doesn't seem to matter what I say though. If people feel like",0

122,"I (21F) am worried about my BF (21M) because of his mother (50-ish F) (cw: brief suicide mention) Ok Reddit, here we go. My boyfriend is in college and he grew up relatively well-off. He grew up moving every 1-2 years, has a couple expensive medical conditions and sometimes had to live in temporary housing like at a church. However, his (divorced) parents were able to buy him a used car in high school so he could get a job and he always had a place to stay. About a year into the relationship I could tell that his mother definitely had some issues-- she would guilt trip him into everything, deny him access to things like therapy and jobs he liked that would give him more Independence and I found out later that as a kid she had convinced a doctor that he had ADHD in order to put him on medicine that essentially turned him into a zombie. Now that he was going to college he has been ok because he has been separated from her for most of the year. This summer (he's now 21) it's the last summer before graduating college and he is definitely more independent than when I met him-- he actually tells her no sometimes. Part of it is college and part of it is having someone around him and her constantly (me) and telling him it's ok to say no if he's uncomfortable doing something. About two weeks ago his mother asked him to pick her up at the airport at 9:30 pm, he said yes. The day of the pickup she said ""actually come at 11:30 pm, if that's too late I'll take an Uber"" he didn't feel comfortable driving that late at night and asked her to take an uber. She asked him to leave the keys in the garage and he did. Two days after that event she went after him (emotionally). She told him that she paid for his car (in high school) and for his insurance (which she said she would until he graduated so he could have to the car) and that that means that if she asks him to do something he is obligated to do it for him. For 30 minutes she put him down about not having a job (he's been trying and has applied to about 5 jobs a day since he's been home but no one wants to hire for just the summer). She told him he's paying the insurance in two weeks or she will sell his car. I understand wanting him to help with insurance but she knows he doesn't have a job yet. And $200 in two weeks is almost impossible without a job. She also told him that she was disgusted that she had to pay for his food and that he thinks it's ok to just lay in bed all day. (He's living with her and food has never been a problem before). He also does have a job writing but it's not what she wants him to do-- his major is writing. so he doesn't just lay in bed all day. She told him that he has shown no respect, curteousy or consideration for her (mentioned that he keeps the house in awful shape-- not true she gets very obsessive with cleaning and 3 crumbs on the floor is unironically a huge issues) and then she told him that she was done with him. Then she proceeded to try to verbally attack me (whether as another way of getting to him or just because she was upset with me too). I've dealt with my own narcissistic father and knew better than to respond to her and that stopped after about two sentences. After this, my boyfriend broke down. He didn't sleep at all and was very suicidal. I also found out that one of his friends had killed themselves that same weekend. This is when I told him that I think he has a narcissistic mother and showed him a video. He asked me to take him to a psych hospital/ ER because he didn't feel safe/ trust himself. I did but when he got there he felt bad because he's on his parents insurance and they would've been the ones to pay for it. Instead we cleaned his room and left for my house so he would be with dogs and my family, he would not be alone or with his mom and they could both have a little space. He asked me not to text her so I didn't. I guess he didn't either so she didn't know we left. She asks where we are about a day later and I end up responding because I feel like she should know. I tell her about the hospital and that we left and that he's still looking for jobs. I then tell her that I'm sorry we didn't let her know and that we figured she would want space. This is what she sent: ""Well at least I know (that we aren't home). This is unacceptable. Convenient that he chooses to blame it on the cost (going to the hospital). His father holds his insurance so he can deal with that if necessary (again hospital). All I have ever asked for is consideration and courtesy. Neither have been given."" (HELLO, YOUR SON IS SUICIDAL AND THIS IS HOW YOU REACT?!) ""Shame on you both."" ""If you will not be back here please let me know so I'll shut everything down. I'm leaving on Friday night. I no longer want to be in the condo I pay for. Congratulations."" I don't think she should speak to me (or anyone) this way but that's besides the point this isn't about me. I'm thinking maybe he should just move out? He might be able to live with his dad and he's almost out of college. Is his mom right, should he just get a job and stay home? I don't want to give him bad advice, but I also want to help. Side note: I don't ever want to deal with this woman again but I love her son so.... Tldr; My BF doesn't pick his mom up from airport and she berates him/ threatens him. We leave his house and it gets worse. He's suicidal and believes he's worthless because of her should he move out despite having any time to prepare? What should he do? What should I do? Who is in the wrong and can this be fixed? &#x200B; (I'm afraid to leave him alone but I also have a full time summer internship-- I've taken a few days off)",0

129,"Should I be upset? My mom felt a man finding out his daughter is a lesbian was as bad as that same man losing his son to suicide. Apologies for the lengthy title but I didnt want to be guilty of click bait with just ""should I be upset"". Let me preface this with the fact that I love my mom. She's one of my best friends. She doesnt know, at least that I know of, that I identify as pansexual. I've always been very openly supportive of the LBGTQ community, long before I came to terms with my own sexuality. If comments get ignorant or aggressive, I'll delete this. I realize that's like saying I'm never shopping at this store again, but I at least need to say it. So a good childhood/early adulthood friend of my brother (30M) committed suicide on monday. My dad was super close to both the son and the father through Boy Scouts. My brother moved out of state, otherwise I'm sure the two guys would have remained super close. Regardless, it was very upsetting. I (32F) have a precious suicide attempt so I knew this would trigger some feelings for my parents. I'm sure it did but my mom was super PC about everything and even remarked that it's (depression) and how can anyone hold that against anyone. Etc. Anyways, my mom said something about the sister's wife and I said I didnt realize she was a lesbian (not to presume a label but for the sake of conversation). My mom said yeah and the dad struggled with it bc he was raised catholic and the bible is against it (in a half joking manner I mentioned the bible's disagreement with bacon, etc) but none of that bothered me. She even said the dad came around bc he saw his daughter was happy. Love it, dream of it. All good. Then my mom proceeds to say how she felt so bad for the dad because he's been through so much. > First a marriage he was unhappy in but ""couldnt"" leave bc of the Catholic's view on divorce; then his daughter comes out; then his son kills himself. She said ""what else could possibly happen"". I said I hardly think his daughter being a lesbian is on par with his son committing suicide. I fully expected her to correct herself, it just being a poor choice of phrasing. Instead, in a serious voice, she said it was the same and that to people in their 60's (she's 68) it is just as bad because back then people weren't gay and it wasnt like it is now. We're (our generation) so much more open to these kinds of things. I was shocked. Much like every other moment where my mom, knowingly or not, dismissed my feelings, I said nothing. I dont remember everything she said but the themes and messages one could infer from the above are accurate. It wasnt that finding out your child is gay is difficult and heavy for multiple reasons including the generation you grew up in, It was totally his child coming out as a lesbian is just as bad as his other child committing suicide. I know my mom loves me and I honestly believe she'd accept me as pansexual after many tears, prayers, and questions (and I'm ok with that). But this hurt. And perhaps what made it hurt the most was this very thing was something I spent years mulling over with my therapist. Feeling like after everything I put my parents through - depression, addiction, suicide attempt, etc. - that being pansexual was one more thing I was punishing them with. One more way to let them down. My friends always assured me that was not the case. To hear my mom articulate the very fears I had finally quieted (after years) was overwhelming. My friend suggested I tell them. That perhaps putting it out there will help remove the terror and ignorance. That they wouldn't say those things if they knew. But having heard those things makes it even harder to want to tell them. Am I overreacting? My friend was empathetic and kind but I felt like she thought I should chalk it up to them not knowing. She agreed it was hurtful and it was ok to be hurt, but also not to take it too seriously. I'm sick of the excuse that my parents dont know. You shouldn't have to have an LGBTQ child to not feel those things. Ugh. Thanks for reading ... xoxo",0

Is this normal procedure?EDIT: Thank you... everyone who has responded here and even went far to DM me advice or share resources. Thank you so much... UPDATE: New discovery with the circumstance of the son's death has pushed for further investigation. I don't know the exact nature of this, but there was enough suspicion that it called for an investigation. What I understand now is that the family was first told the death was a possible suicide but was never concluded as one, but the family began pooling money anyway. That's when my friend sold his truck and I wrote the first post. I am still questioning where they got this idea that suicide voids SGLI and other VA assistance though. I have yet to talk to the ex's family, but I also understand if they jumped to conclusion from grief and panic. What I also understand is that none of the family has received anything as beneficiary as of yet. Today, due to a possible related event with the son's death, the family requested for a second autopsy, and further examination is to be expected. The transportation of the son has been postponed. My friend was calm this noon as I was able to maintain longer conversation. I was able to suggest what you all have kindly provided me, VA resources that may assist him and his family financially. His ex-parents-in-laws have also flown over last night to be with him. They now wait for further updates and plan the next step. It's still not comforting what may have happened to the son, but i can only hope my friend and his family can find peace soon... In hindsight, it seems I too have overreacted and gave harsh judgement to military protocol and the actual care provided to servicemen and families for events like this. I apologise whole-heartedly. Finally, I thank each one of you once again. -------------------- First of all, I apologize if i used any military term incorrectly. Second, I am asking this question entirely of my own and not speaking in behalf of my friend. Third, I hope this is the correct subreddit to ask this. My good friend's son recently had committed suicide while living in army base. This has been a devastating event for the dad. The son is the child between him and his ex-wife. I have been keeping in close touch with the dad who has been my long friend, as I feared he too may go into depression. I learned that he sold his only truck to get his son back to his family. He was told that suicide was considered dishonorable and the expenses is to be shouldered by the family. My question is, is this normal? I understand and don't expect the military to compensate for funeral services or any additional expenses, but i assumed they would at least assist in delivering the body back to the family. My concern is that my friend isn't exactly rich. He has this 1997 Nissan truck which is his only way to get around places and to work, and I know neither he or I can afford to buy another car right now. The moment he was told that they need to come up with the money to deliver the body, he sold his truck without hesitation. I fear this event may financially cripple him and have unwanted consequences for his mental health as he had spoken about following after his son. The least I can do right now is to help pay for his flight to his ex-wife to greet his son when he arrives. I'm just finding myself saddened how my friend's case was handled especially for a family who are financially struggling. Wondering what if the family was ultimately unable to provide to pay for the transportation, would the body remain in the base indefinitely until they are able to? Is this how suicide victims are treated or its the general procedure of any death of servicemen? Or maybe there's something that I'm missing or not seeing. I'm sorry if I sound accusatory against military procedure. This is not my intention. I myself am emotionally stirred as I am having hard time choosing the correct word to express this. It's difficult seeing your friend goes through something like this. I may be projecting my frustrations and this is me trying to cope. If anyone can clarify this, I sincerely appreciate it.",0

I feel like part of this is my fault and now its too late.I am not sure if this is the right place for this. &#x200B; My daughter died from cancer, a very fast acting cancer which she choose to not get treatment for. Over the span of 4 months, she deteriorated and then died. During this time, my husband turned into a severe alcoholic and drug abuser. I got depressed, as did my son. Watching my daughter, the sweetest child in the world, pass away like that was horrific. &#x200B; My husbands alcoholism (and drug abuse, he was doing pills heavily as well, although tried to keep it secret) spiraled out of control to the point where he was drinking a 20 dollar bottle of vodka every day, and then some more after. He would often go out and not come home for the entire night. My son kept on trying to get him to stop, and I sort of tried... but I was so depressed that I just didnt have the heart to put in much emotional effort into him. I isolated myself completely, and was like a zombie. My husband died in our basement bathroom, covered in his own vomit. He died from a mix of huge amounts of alcohol and huge amounts of xanax and tramadol mixed together. I knew he was doing pills, but I never knew the real extent of it until we found his stash of pills after he died. His death came about 3-4 months after my daughters death. &#x200B; After my husband died, I sort of woke up from my daze, but not for long before I fell back into it. My son also fell into a horrible, deep depression. It wasn't only his dad and sister dying. His grades fell apart, he got rejected from almost every college except for community colleges. He gained well over 100 pounds in the year after his dad died. Both of us were just a mess. I didn't leave bed most days, he stayed in his room... doing whatever he would do. Video games I imagined. I didn't ignore the signs completely the way I did with my husband. I tried to reach out to him, get him into therapy, for a while. But my own depression was so bad that I was giving up on everything. I think at a certain point we just left each other alone. &#x200B; In the 2 months before, we barely spoke at all. It wasn't hard, our house is big, our rooms are far apart. And then he tried to kill himself, by throwing himself off of a bridge nearby. He survived. He got a broken foot and his toe is all mangled, but he survived. I saw where he threw himself off, it was a long distance. I don't even know how he managed to only break his foot. &#x200B; I feel such a wave of guilt flow over me since the incident. Both for him and for my husband too. I didn't pay enough attention, I didn't give them what they needed, I was selfish honestly. I am their mother and wife and I just isolated myself instead of being with them and helping them and getting them through this. I constantly think that if I was more attentive, more demanding for my husband to get sober, then this wouldn't have happened. None of it. Losing my daughter was horrible, but we couldn't control that. But this? This is our decisions. And my presence influences their decisions arguably more than anything. &#x200B; I just don't know what to do. I want to help my son but don't know how, and I feel he is ignoring my attempts to help him, because I have ignored him for so long. I can't tell if he is still suicidal. I can't tell if the second his foot heals he is going to try again. I am 'awake' in that I am aware of my being and place instead of being a depressed zombie like I have been for the past 2 years... but I am feeling hopeless again that I cant help.",1

156,"My son has been having suicidal thoughts for the past year. When I read his journal, this is what I found.It had always been there, slithering in the night. The dark shadow it left behind, the horrors of the people who would consume it. It waited for them, feeding on the evil in their hearts. It was quite easy. The darkness knew about the evils of man. The darkness had been consuming lives since the dawn of time, and its next victim was in the wait. It had been there since the boy was born. It always picked its victims at youth. If they heard it's voice when they were young they would be gradually easier to overcome. It started with a whisper in your dreams, an afterthought in your head. *Come to me*, it would say. *Use me*, it would beg. And so it would begin, the boy would take the darkness. Then the darkness would take the boy with him to the darkest pits of hell. It had started. The boy was one, just mastering the skill of walking. The darkness knew it was time. It crept at the edge of the forest, silently watching, neither moving or speaking. The boy was walking just on the outside of the woods, happily enjoying his time with his parents. If the darkness could smile it would. This was a time of happiness, a time of great joy. A moment like this could easily be ruined, and it would ripple through the boys life. The monster of the shadows slithered forward, and now it would start hunting its prey. The boy was excited. All of his life he had crawled on the ground, but now he would take his first steps. He was overjoyed, ecstatic even. He stepped one foot on the ground then he heard a thump behind him. The boy heard screaming and then the shouting of his father. The boy didn't know what was happening. Why were they screaming? What had happened? The boy was confused. Thunderous noises played from afar. There was screeching and more voices who joined the first. The boy kept hearing one repeated phrase, *dead, dead*. He didn't know what was happening, what was going on. The boy then heard another voice, but this one was only in his head. *There there*, whispered the voice. The voice was comforting and warm. The boy was scared and confused, he needed someone to be there for him. *I'm here for you. I am your friend. They won't hurt you. They can't touch you. All you need is me.* The boy was comforted by the voice. Maybe it could help him. Maybe it could take away the pain. Don't be scared child. I'm all you need. The young boy didn't know what had just happened, but his new friend could now make things better. Five years later and the boy had a best friend. The darkness was his companion, his comforter. It could take his problems away. That fateful day five years ago, his mother had died of a heart attack. But he didn't need her, he had the darkness. All he needed was him. The darkness loved him, cherished him. It was his companion. He loved the darkness and the darkness loved him. This was exactly what the beast wanted him to think. The boy talked to the darkness regularly now. They had conversation that lasted for hours. *Don't go to them. They will only hurt you.* The darkness told the boy not to play with any other children he saw. The boy eagerly obeyed, wanting to please his friend. Why need anyone else? The darkness was always there for him. The boy could talk to him anytime. His dad thought that this thing wasn't real. He presumed that the beast was only a figment of the boys imagination. The boy knew the truth. This creature was real, and it loved him. Five more years had past and the boy was sweating nervously. He was in a shop clutching a bottle in his hand. His father had given into grief and now drunk a vile poison. His father was now always angry, throwing and muttering things under his breath. He would slam the boy on the kitchen table and beat him. Nobody would sell his father more of that poison so now, his father needed him to take it by force. The boy was scared, what if the people found out and hurt him, what if they beat him like his father has? *They won't hurt you, I am here. With me by your side they won't lay a finger on you.* The boy nods, comfort in his heart. His friend would protect him. The darkness would keep him safe. The boy slipped the bottle into the coat and slipped away with his fathers prize. The boy trembled as he walked to his father. No matter what he did he would never please him. At least he had his darkness. Five years later and the boy shared in his father’s poison. He had no other way. The despair clawed the way into his heart. The sadness drowned him. The darkness encouraged him to do it. *It is a gift. It will help you. He won't hurt you if you share in his delight.* The boy reluctantly drunk the poison, and it became his companion. Ten years later and the boy was on the streets. This boy who was once a child, full of youth and light. He had destroyed himself. He trembled as he sipped the poison. He sobbed, years of despair and regret pulled at him. He had rejected friends and family. He had fought and harmed others. All because the darkness told him. It would not be his friend anymore if he didn't. The boy, now a man, realized with bitterness this thing was not his friend. It had caused the death of his mother. It had filled his father with grief and pain. It gave him the very thing his father thought would take the pain away. The darkness wasn't the boys friend. The darkness was this man’s worst enemy. One year later and the man was living in a dump. He had nowhere else to go. No friends, and no family that cared about him. But the man had a solution. He could solve all his problems with one movement. He could end the pain and free himself from the beast that had ruined his life. As he lifted the key to his freedom to his head, memories swarmed the man's head. His mom, his father. What he could have been. The people that he could have met. The wife he could have married. All of these thoughts invaded him and a single tear dropped down the man’s face. With a quick flick of the finger and a bang, the man was gone. The darkness chuckled. All these years of temptation its work was complete. The years of pretending to be his friend and comforter. The darkness made the boy dependent on him and driven him to madness. It's work was done. A young girl would be born in a hospital nearby. She would be joyfully welcomed by friends and family. If only she knew about the best friend she would soon have.",0
157,"Update: Bf [20M] threatened to commit suicide when I [20F] broke up with him.OP: So I took all your advice and broke up with him. I just hope it's the right decision though because things got really crazy. I texted his best friend and told him what happened and said that I wanted to break up for good and asked for his help. I could not tell his family since they make me uncomfortable and I know if I told them that their son is suicidal they'd immediately blame me for manipulating him. Anyhow, his friend was really nice about it and said that he'd look after my bf John (not his real name) when I decide to break up. After that I called John and asked to meet him at the food court on the mall. We talked and I said that I couldn't be in our relationship anymore and I was feeling suffocated. He said that he doesn't understand, he thought that I was over this since we talked about it. I told him that I was just saying that because I felt panicked. He started crying in public and I felt so bad for him. Then he begged me to talk about it more in private. I figured it's the least I could do since I'm breaking up with him so we went to his place and talked more. He started trying to be sweet, talking about the sweet and romantic stuff we did. I admit that I felt really bad for breaking up then, and I wanted to get back with him, but I had to remind myself that I needed some space. He started crying harder and I couldn't take it anymore so I went to the bathroom and tried to collect myself. When I went back to his room I saw him trying to hide my shoes. asked him what he was doing and he looked guilty and said nothing, but I think he wanted to hide it so I wouldn't be able to leave. At that point I just really wanted to go so I asked for my shoes, he gave it but he was blocking the door. I said I'd start screaming if he doesn't let me leave, so he moved aside and started following me, all this time he was begging and saying he'd give me more space and asking ""what am I going to do now?"" And also saying how he'd kill himself if I leave. But I was so tired of that. I said if you keep following me I'm going straight to the police station and say you assaulted me with a serious face (I was bluffing) so he stopped following and I went home. I texted his friend and asked him if John was OK and he said that he's been crying and locked up in his room, and I asked about his gun and my friend said that he hid and locked it so he won't think of using it (they're roommates) . I changed my number when I got home so I don't know if John was texting me. I also deactivated my Facebook so I didn't have to deal with him. But since I broke up with him, he'd be at the front of our house just sitting there waiting for me. And he knows my schedule so I just ask my brother for a ride to my class. I tried asking my dad and brother to talk to him, And my dad did, but he just felt sorry for him after they talk, and since he's not really doing anything that it's OK -_- I just have to deal with him until he gets tired of it I guess? Sorry for the wall of text and the grammar. I'm feeling weird so I just wanted to tell someone I guess. I'll update if something important Happens TLDR; broke up with bf, he's still following me around",0
158,"And just like clockwork - I’m to blame for the fact her son is a piece of shit. TW: suicideFH called his dad yesterday to see how he was doing. He called me afterward and told me that he was worried because his dad was real short with him on the phone. He then called his mom to see if everything was ok with fil. She said that because of his deteriorating health, he’s been short with everyone. I didn’t buy it but whatever. I could feel a storm a-brewing. I was right. Mil texted FH last night to let him know that Family Friends son had tried to commit suicide on Tuesday night. FH texted FF to see if they were both ok. This morning, FH called mil to see if she had an update about ff’s son. Now, FF lives pretty close to BIL (about a four hour drive away). Mil then just started in on FH and said she was going to [town] and was going to stop in on ff to see how she was and that FH should come “without [me] and speak to BIL.” FH asked who was going to be there because at this point he didn’t know if she was visiting BIL or not but also that he would certainly not be doing that, especially without me. She said “For fucks sake FH, you need to get over it. You and OP are in the wrong and you need to stop this bullshit **now**. I will not put up with this any longer, she [me] needs to get the fuck over it. **she** is in the wrong.” Of course FH, not expecting this, began to sort of stutter which he does sometimes when he’s anxious. He said we still have not received an apology and as such, he will still not be speaking to his brother. She said that he still asks her to do stuff for her (he doesn’t) and that why would she do anything for him when **he can’t do anything for her**. I later said to FH when he was retelling this that you don’t do things for people because you want something in return. She started swearing and screaming at him and hung up. I was livid. Absolutely fucking livid. She’s throwing a fucking tantrum because we aren’t just lying down and taking the abuse. I hate her so much that my blood boils. So all this happened while FH was at work and I was at home. Time started getting on and I was wondering where he was because he usually calls me when he finishes work, which he would have about two hours earlier. So I called him. He was at her house. He said he was there to pick something up from Neighbour Boss, but NB wasn’t home yet. I was trying not to scream but told him that I’d just see him when he got home, thinking he’d also went over to talk. He came home later on, **NOTHING** of the conversation this morning was mentioned. She didn’t even allude to it and neither did he. Well I just lost it and told him **exactly** how o feel about the hole he crawled out of. I said that she was a sorry excuse for a mother, that she was an asshole and that I cannot fucking stand her. That she throws tantrums to get what she wants and abuses him until he submits. That she says anything she can to hurt him to smack him back in line and that I’m done. I said he needed to grow some balls, put his foot down and fucking stick to it otherwise nothing will change. That if I didn’t love him so much I would have left by now. He said he was hurt by this but I told him that this was going to be the rest of my life now and that is not something I am willing to accept or resign to. I said she’s only going to get worse when we get married, after we’re married and when we have kids. I told him I don’t want her around our children after the way I have seen her treat her own. I said “Do something about it or I will and it will **not** be beneficial for you if I do.” I also said that she uses to excuse of “but he’s my son!” To defend BIL but does not offer FH the same courtesy. I was damn near hysterical crying by the end because I’m so enraged. FH said that he feels shit about it because no one has still actually sat and listened to what he has to say and that he still has a lot to get off his chest. I said I feel the same way because anytime we try and say anything we are literally swore at and shouted down and told to shut up. So advice please - if I did decide to text/email mil (undecided yet) how exactly should I word this? What I want to say is that I’m disgusted with the way FH is treated by his whole family and that I will not be a part of it, nor will I “let go” of the abuse BIL has inflicted upon me for years. I will **not** take any form of blame for having enough self respect to stick up for myself, and I certainly will not submit to the tantrums of she and BIL. My finger is literally on the trigger right now. I have so so so much fucked up shit happening in my life right now aside from this and my mental health is the worst it’s been in years. I’ve been prescribed anti depressants (which is probably another fault) have contemplated suicide over the last few weeks and even had a seizure due to stress for fucks sake. None of this relates to mil and co., and it’s to do with an entirely different issue I have going on, but mil knows a large portion of what’s going on and the stress and anxiety it’s causing me. She just doesn’t give a fuck. You’d think as well that if ff’s son has attempted suicide this week, she’d maybe reflect on how she treats her son and how it affects his mental health (which a few weeks ago he tried to explain but she brushed it off to tell him how big of a piece of shit he is) or she’d like hold her son a little closer, but no. I know for a fact that she’s going to blame FH and I for causing undue stress for fil which is causing his health to deteriorate which is simply not true. She’ll pull any sort of fucked up tactic for us to fall back in line. I think she hates me because I’ve helped FH shine his spine and I will happily take the blame. She’s such a selfish fucking cunt. I hate her so much. I fucking hate BIL more than I’ve ever hated anyone in my life. He still has not contacted FH which FH is more than happy with. What do I do? I’m already NC but it hasn’t helped as much as it should have because I still have so much I feel like I have to say that I can’t and I feel like I’m going to explode.",0
159,[Theo Fleury] 15 years ago I had a fully loaded pistol in my mouth ready to end my life not because I wanted to die but I was exhausted from living in emotional pain and suffering. I started talking about my trauma and started to heal. #WorldSuicidePreventionDay,0
160,"I think Im ready to end my life.Ive been dealing with my own negative thoughts for 8 years of my life. I cant find help from my family cause they just get mad at me and tell me that all I have to do is go to school and watch my niece. Im fine with all of it but tonight just tipped the scales. (Im sorry if this gets confusing. Im writing this while crying.) For the past almost 2 years ive been watching my niece everytime i have free time cause my sister has work and beauty school. Im fine with watching her when necessary but tonight my mom, dad, and sister wanted to go to the bar. Earlier today i told my sister that i didnt want to watch my niece cause i had to watch her from 7 to noon today. I go to bed at 8 cause im tired and i hear my dad calling for me and i yell down that im not watching her tonight and thats when my mom starts screaming at me telling me that my life isnt hard and that i just need to suck it up. I know my life isnt hard but I haven't been able to be a teenager because of family issues from my sister having a baby with a abusive man and his family ruining our already failing family. I have to watch my niece everyday, deal with both my parents fighting nonstop, deal with my sister going back to the father of her baby and getting all worked up when he beats her again. I never complain about any of it. I go to school and get good grades, i dont get in any trouble whatsoever, i dont ask for anything that cost money, i dont bother anyone, i dont even complain when im losing all my friends around me cause my home life is fucking me up and i dont know who the fuck i am anymore im losing my fucking mind. I started crying when my mom yelled and she says ""im not gonna pity you just because you pulled the "" i have anxiety card"" you dont even know what having difficulties is like."" My parents dont even try to understand what wrong with me they just get annoyed and get mad at me. Im tired of everything. At school Im the kid that tries to make sure everyone is happy and I take on any task that people need me to do cause I cant say no. Im so tired. Im in my junior year of high school and no one ever believes me when i ask for help cause i want to die cause ive always been the happy kid and the happy kid cant be sad. Im not the best kid but im sure as hell not the worst and im tired of feeling like shit when im around my parents and im going to kill myself soon enough. Im sorry for my rant and for it being so long. I just am hoping that someone might read this and understand me for the first time in my life. I feel so alone. Im so tired.",1
161,"[X-post from r/depression] I am ready to end my lifeI don't know what else to do anymore. I'm in my mid-30s,single and never married, no kids, unemployed, stuck in the middle of nowhere living with my toxic narcissistic mother. I've been suffering from depression for months and when I try to open up or talk about it, people say I'm making excuses, and not trying hard enough. I keep trying to find a job, and getting nowhere, I've been to so many interviews, only to suffer the old bait-and-switch. All my experience is the restaurant business, as a dishwasher, busboy, and a waiter. I keep applying for restaurant jobs that advertise how they need dishwashers, and prep cooks, or busboys, during the day, but when I interview it's for a line cook position, at night! I can't do that job. I've tried on several occasions, and I just can't do it. I'm not good at it, and I don't like doing it. But for some reason it seems to be all I can find, and I hate this weird stereotype that if you want a career in a restaurant you have to cook. THERE ARE OTHER JOBS IN A RESTAURANT BESIDES COOKING! It doesn't help matters that I need daytime hours. The reason being, that, I live in the country, the nearest town is about 20 miles away. I don't have a driver's license because no one wants to help me get it. I've held a learner's permit for almost a year, and I have next to no driving experience, and no one wants to help me get that experience or help me learn to drive. My only chance of getting a job is find one in town. in order to make that work I either have to have transportation to and from, or live in town so I can ride my bike there. I can't ride my bike into town everyday because the highway between here and there is a death trap of steep hills, blind curves, and redneck drivers who will not share the road with someone on a bike. The few times I've tried it were not only exhausting, but I was nearly killed several times by drivers who have no tolerance for a bicycle on the highway. Staying in town means being homeless, and shelters lock their doors at around 10pm. Any night time job means not getting off work until 11pm at the earliest, and the shelters do not make exceptions, regardless of your circumstances, they just ask ""Can't you switch to days?"" Umm... No, I can't, the only hours they had available were nights. If I had transportation, or a place in town, I could make it work, but I don't have either of those things, which means not having anywhere to go when I get off work. Trying to find someone to take me back and forth means finding someone willing to drive 80 miles a day (20 to get me to work, then they drive 20 back to go home, then another 20 to come get me, and then 20 to bring me home. The average vehicle gets about 20 miles to the gallon, and gas is about $3 a gallon, so right off the bat it's $12 a day in gas, plus at least another $20 for the trouble of driving me, that's $32 a day in transportation costs, and my average pay is about $10 an hour, which means about half my pay is going just to transportation. The only reason I've been able to make it to interviews is by getting up early and literally hitchhiking to town. They're usually in the afternoon, and everybody heads to their work in town early. A 2pm interview for me means getting up at 5am, putting interview clothes and hygiene supplies in my backpack, hitching a ride, and then changing and freshening up at the public library bathroom. Then when it's over I try and hitch back. i usually get home by 7pm. So I get up at 5am and get home around 7pm just to make it to a 2pm job interview that lasts 20-30 minutes, tops. Then there's my train wreck of a mother. It's always something with her. I've been homeless on the streets in the middle of winter, trying to work a full time job, and she's constantly calling me whining about how she doesn't have X or is out of Y, and she's worried about Z, and sobbing crocodile tears about how nobody cares, and I'm the only one who can help her, and I always do, which is why I remain homeless; because I don't make much money, but mom desperately needs whatever I have, just so she can turn around the next week and cozy up to her on again off again boyfriend, and mooch off of him. But then for some reason the next week, (my pay week), she's on the outs with him and once again I'm ""the only one who cares, and can help"" She's an alcoholic who keeps going back and forth with her abusive boyfriend. i've had several good restaurant jobs in the past, but they were places that had bars in them, and she makes a habit of turning my work into her hangout and get drunk spot, then she constantly makes a scene while she's drunk, and smarts off about how her son works there, and she can do whatever she wants, which leads to me getting fired. The unfortunate nick-name ""Norman Bates"" has followed me from several jobs. She doesn't have a license or vehicle, so she can't help me, and even if she did have, she wouldn't/couldn't help me because of her drinking. sometimes she's here at the house, most of the time she's at her boyfriend's. He will not help me. He's the typical redneck conservative who feels like I should already have a license, and it's my own fault for not being able to get one without any help from anyone, even though it is literally impossible to get a driver's license completely on your own. So I'm stuck at the house by myself most of the time. Food is sparse, and usually what I get is cheap and processed, mostly canned and frozen. My health has been declining as a result of the poor diet that has been forced upon me. Canned veggies are NOT as good for you as fresh. The only reason i have food is because when i hitch hike to town I visit the local food pantries. Once in a while mom throws me $20 to get food up here at the nearby dollar store. It's a 5 mile hike there and back. There's electricity and water here only because my Mom pays them for her disability records. She has to maintain her own residence to keep getting her disability, so she uses this place for that purpose, even though for all intents and purposes she lives with her boyfriend who makes thousands as an independent electrical contractor, and owns a house on 5 acres and has half a dozen vehicles at his disposal. He drinks all the time and is verbally and physically abusive to my mom, who puts up with it because he literally throws hundreds of dollars at her when he gets drunk. And Even though my mom's only here part time, I can't treat this place like it's mine. There's only one bedroom in this trailer, and I can't use it. I sleep on a comforter on the floor of the living room. When she's here, I have no privacy, and I can't do anything. She sits at the kitchen table all day on Facebook, worrying about what everyone else is doing, and commenting on it. If I try to watch something or play a video game, I can't have the sound on unless I wear headphones, and I can't wear headphones because she'll keep trying to talk to me about the dumb BS she finds on Facebook, while I have them on, and she gets pissed because I can't hear her. So when she's here, I basically have to sit and do nothing but wait to respond to her. i just don't know what to do anymore. I can't seem to find a day job to literally save my life. Everyday i get more and more depressed and hopeless, and endlessly bored. Nothing interests me anymore. Not video games, or movies, or anything on Netflix or YouTube. i endlessly scroll Reddit all day, everyday, seeing the same posts over and over. I'm always putting in job applications through Craigslist and Indeed. I can't get professional help with my depression and ADHD symptoms because i don't have any kind of insurance, and I'm broke. i have no family nearby that I can turn to except for the drunk mother. I \*want\* to go back to town, and be homeless but employed. I've done it before, and thrived, (until my mother enters the picture). I want to go back to town and get away from all of this shit, but I can't unless i have a job. That's the only missing ingredient, is a job. I don't even care about the hours because I have a tent, i can find a hiding spot in some woods outside town, and ride my bike to and from. I can talk to management about barring my mother from patronizing the place where I work. But it has to be a job i can \*do\* and I can't work the line, I tried, i was terrible. Maybe if i had the right training, and had more experience, i could do it, i don't know. I feel like I'm stuck, and I'm completely isolated which isn't helping anything. Maybe I just have to go back to town without a job lined up and do my best. I can't take much more of this. I've already tied a noose just in case. i just feel better having it around. It's my escape hatch. Honestly the only reason I haven't used it yet, or just bailed and gone to town is because she left her cat behind here with me. I care more about the cat than I do her, because if it weren't for the cat I'd be completely alone.",1

He's the typical redneck conservative who feels like I should already have a license, and it's my own fault for not being able to get one without any help from anyone, even though it is literally impossible to get a driver's license completely on your own. So I'm stuck at the house by myself most of the time. Food is sparse, and usually what I get is cheap and processed, mostly canned and frozen. My health has been declining as a result of the poor diet that has been forced upon me. Canned veggies are NOT as good for you as fresh. The only reason i have food is because when i hitch hike to town I visit the local food pantries. Once in a while mom throws me $20 to get food up here at the nearby dollar store. It's a 5 mile hike there and back. There's electricity and water here only because my Mom pays them for her disability records. She has to maintain her own residence to keep getting her disability, so she uses this place for that purpose, even though for all intents and purposes she lives with her boyfriend who makes thousands as an independent electrical contractor, and owns a house on 5 acres and has half a dozen vehicles at his disposal. He drinks all the time and is verbally and physically abusive to my mom, who puts up with it because he literally throws hundreds of dollars at her when he gets drunk. And Even though my mom's only here part time, I can't treat this place like it's mine. There's only one bedroom in this trailer, and I can't use it. I sleep on a comforter on the floor of the living room. When she's here, I have no privacy, and I can't do anything. She sits at the kitchen table all day on Facebook, worrying about what everyone else is doing, and commenting on it. If I try to watch something or play a video game, I can't have the sound on unless I wear headphones, and I can't wear headphones because she'll keep trying to talk to me about the dumb BS she finds on Facebook, while I have them on, and she gets pissed because I can't hear her. So when she's here, I basically have to sit and do nothing but wait to respond to her. i just don't know what to do anymore. I can't seem to find a day job to literally save my life. Everyday i get more and more depressed and hopeless, and endlessly bored. Nothing interests me anymore. Not video games, or movies, or anything on Netflix or YouTube. i endlessly scroll Reddit all day, everyday, seeing the same posts over and over. I'm always putting in job applications through Craigslist and Indeed. I can't get professional help with my depression and ADHD symptoms because i don't have any kind of insurance, and I'm broke. i have no family nearby that I can turn to except for the drunk mother. I \*want\* to go back to town, and be homeless but employed. I've done it before, and thrived, (until my mother enters the picture). I want to go back to town and get away from all of this shit, but I can't unless i have a job. That's the only missing ingredient, is a job. I don't even care about the hours because I have a tent, i can find a hiding spot in some woods outside town, and ride my bike to and from. I can talk to management about barring my mother from patronizing the place where I work. But it has to be a job i can \*do\* and I can't work the line, I tried, i was terrible. Maybe if i had the right training, and had more experience, i could do it, i don't know. I feel like I'm stuck, and I'm completely isolated which isn't helping anything. Maybe I just have to go back to town without a job lined up and do my best. I can't take much more of this. I've already tied a noose just in case. i just feel better having it around. It's my escape hatch. Honestly the only reason I haven't used it yet, or just bailed and gone to town is because she left her cat behind here with me. I care more about the cat than I do her, because if it weren't for the cat I'd be completely alone.",1

166,"Treated like shit - Ready to end my life. My life hasn't been easy... I attempted suicide first at age 8 by jumping in front of a car. Again at 15 with insulin overdose. Last time was 26 or so, overdose on opiates and antiemetics and tied a bag around my head. I spent 2 weeks in a coma in the ICU, but I swear I just can't die. I'm 34, a single parent of two sons... I've tried so hard to keep it together but I've been faking it every day, and I know they would be better off the sooner I am gone. I work in healthcare and have been bullied since day one, first for my sexuality, then progressed into more. About 20 people in total have been harassing me. I went to HR and they fired the homophobic nurse, but now the others are even worse. My manager told me a month ago that I'm getting a promotion and will be working at a different site because of the bullying. However, I haven't heard an update and when I asked timing, I was told ""in a few months"". I don't believe anything will change, and I can't have another day of this. I have been applying to other jobs for a year, but my career is in a very specific field with only 1-2 openings a year in medium sized cities like mine. I bought a house in March and have other bills to pay and have full custody of my sons, so I can't just leave my job. When I am dead, they will be in good hands with my mother. I'm so sorry to them, and I promise them they will be better when I'm gone, and they will get over it in time. But I can't keep living in misery day after day just to keep them happy. I'm posting here as a way to give myself permission. I know that suicide has always been the end of my path, I just didn't know when. Now I do, and I'm so relieved. I'm sorry boys.",1
167,"Ready to end my life My friend left me alone under a fucking nasty ass bridge. He never came back because he said it was something about his grandma. I though he was lying. I came home crying and screaming. I bashed my head against the wall. Then my dad. My fucking dad. My dad that hasn’t slept in 2 days. Said “what the hell is wrong with you” I told him what happened. He told me I could see this guy anymore. I continued to scream cry, he called me a two year old and said things like “I can’t believe you expect to be treated like and adult”. I cried in my room in a ball and he burst in my room and screamed “STOP CRYING NOW” it was the worst thing ever. I called my mom. She talked me off a ledge a bit. I’d kill myself if I could. The only way I could would be hanging which I’ve tried before and it never works. As I was typing this he came and my room and looked at him angrily and he said “don’t look at me like you wanna rip my heart out or something” fuck you dad. Fuck you from taking my best friend away from me. Fuck your for yelling at me while I was having a mental breakdown fuck you fuck your fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you FUCK YOU.

I'm sorry for the pain I'll cause, the pain that is to come for a lifetime, and the pain before this all. I know I wasn't easy to deal with, but I'm really grateful I had all of you guys to help me. I know you did the best you could do. Please don't think it wasn't enough. I was a lost cause enough as it was. Mom, Dad. I was raped when I was 14 by my boyfriend. You know who he is, so I won't name him. I never told you guys, because I was ashamed to. Now it's too late, and I feel like you should know. I feel like you should also know that my sister molested me when I was 4. I repressed it all of these years until I was 18. I still have flashbacks of it. I'm sorry, again, I never told you. I didn't know how to say it, and I didn't want to fuck things up. To my brother, I'm sorry I wasn't the best sister there was. I shut you out on a lot of my life, because I was afraid to show you all these sides of me. I was afraid to show you how mentally fucked up your sister was. I'm so sorry I never showed you. Please don't feel like you didn't do anything good, because you did. You did all you could do, and it was my fault I shut you out. You are the best big brother anyone could ask for, and I'm so happy I had you as a brother. I promise it won't hurt so much. I love you. To my friends and sorority, I know I told you all pf my struggles. I tried to keep with ritual, and do everything I could do to live life to the fullest and happiest. But I couldn't. I let you all down, and I'm sorry. ALAM. To banni. I know you're having a hard time with this now. I want you to know it wasn't your fault. It never was. You did the best you could do with what you had. You are mentally ill too, my love. You're halfway across the world. You did all you could, and I promise it was more than enough. I'm sorry I left you alone. I promised I never would. I promised I wouldn't jump from that building, but I hope you know why I did. I promise it wasn't your fault, nothing is. I loved you more than anything in this world, and I do believe we would have made beautiful children and had a long and happy life together. I know it hurts now, but in time it will be fine.

My grades steadily declined in high school, and I feel I only graduated because of pity from my teachers; I had barely completed any homework assignments my senior year, including papers. College has been going terribly as well. I originally planned on attending a four-year school away from home, but my anxiety deterred me from such an endeavor, and I ended home less than a day after arriving at the dorms following a series of panic attacks. I started attending a local community college, but my eating disorder got to the point where I was admitted into the hospital for about eleven days, and I had to withdraw from classes that semester so as to pursue treatment. I was able to enroll in classes this semester, but I am unable to focus in class, and I can't stay focused enough to complete my homework assignments; all while displaying a facade of doing well to my family. I've been taking oxycodone pills from my mom irregularly in order to ease the pain. I'm not yet addicted, but I fear that drug addiction is an inevitability, as no antidepressant or mood-stabilizing drug I've been prescribed over the years as helped in the least. I greatly enjoy reading and writing, yet the latter enjoyment is one I feel I can not pursue, as I have absolutely nothing worthwhile to say, and I'm terrible at it. I have nothing to contribute to the world, and I feel ready to die.",1
175,"I was right there, ready to end my life When I was much younger, maybe 12 years old, I was hit hard by depression. For the first time in my life, I was sad and nothing could make me feel better. My entire life, I had been a great kid. Sure, I talked back sometimes, but I was generally well-behaved and I always did extremely well in school. I was always one of the top kids in my class despite being nearly a year younger than most of my classmates (I had been sent to kindergarten a year earlier than I should've). Then I hit sixth grade. Then my youth and emotional immaturity caught up with me. I started to slip. I became disorganized, I didn't do homework, and when I did, I lost it and couldn't turn it in. I would physically make myself sick so I didn't have to go to school. For the first time, I was failing several classes, and my parents just seemed so disappointed. I would come home, and my mom would just look sad, with a ""what happened"" expression on her face. We decided not to tell my dad because we though I could turn it around and it'd be like it never happened. Near the third quarter of the year, my grades hadn't really improved that much, and my dad eventually found out. He was very mad at us, not for me failing school, but because we never told him. That was a mistake on our parts. I felt like I had betrayed my father, and let him down at the same time. He always told me to do my best, and now I just wasn't doing my best. I was falling down a dark spiral. Outside of school, the girl I had a major crush on was being friendly with another boy in my class, and it just pained me to see them laughing together. I never tried to tell her how I felt because I feared being humiliated and rejected (I still do, but that's not the point). I know it's pathetic to talk about my 12-year-old-self like I had a love life and all that, but at the time it seemed like such a big deal to me. I thought I loved this girl, and it brought me so much pain that I could never be with her. I also played football (American) through all this. I was a smaller kid, but I was always one of the strongest kids on the team, so I'd play on the offensive line and as a cornerback because of my quickness. I always wanted to play running back though. I was fast and I could get around the defenders so well. When I was put in one game during the 4th quarter when we had already blown the other team out, I was able to make every first down I was given the ball. I'd carry 4 or 5 kids bigger than me an extra 2-3 yards to cross that line. Despite this, I never got to play running back on the first line -- I was still stuck on the line. Then this new kid moves from another school and immediately gets put on the running back squad. I was crushed. My hopes and dreams of being a running back were squashed, and I started to blame myself for it. At home, my mother and father noticed I was changing. One time, I don't even remember the context, I just told my mother that I wished I was dead. She just looked at me and said ""don't you say that"" as her eyes filled with tears. I felt bad and blamed myself for making my mother sad. I felt like I was hurting everyone around me. I started having dreams where I hurt my brother, my best friends, and my family. I tried to suffocate myself with my bedsheets, but my mother came in my room to check on me and stopped me. She sat with me for a while until I was relaxed enough to go to bed. A few nights later, I woke up in the middle of the night after another bad dream. I thought to myself, *tonight is the night I end my life*. It's like 2:30 in the morning, and everyone else was asleep. I slowly crept downstairs into the kitchen, careful not to wake my father on the family room couch (he snored pretty loudly). I slowly pulled out the chef's knife that my mother used when she cooked for us. I just held it in my hand. I was ready to stab myself right through the chest. I thought about how I would be relieving myself and everyone around me, and I thought about what it might feel like to stab myself in the heart. Then my mind drifted, and I thought about what my mother would do when she woke up and saw me lying face down in a pool of my own blood with a knife in my chest. I couldn't bear that thought -- that look she would have on her face as she held her precious baby in her arms, cold and dead. I broke down and sobbed. I sat on the vinyl kitchen floor for 10 minutes and sobbed quietly. I then put the knife back and went back to my room. I cried myself to sleep, repeating ""I'm so sorry mommy"" to myself over and over again. Years later, I went to a therapist and we talked about my depression and what I could do to conquer it. After months and months of therapy, I was much better. Today, I am happier than ever before and so glad I decided to not throw my life away over my petty 12-year-old-self's problems. To those out there who think they're at the end of their rope, remember all the good things in your life and hold onto them. Remember the people who care about you and want to see you. Remember all the memories you have, and all the good things that will come in the future. When you're at the end of your rope, tie a knot and hold on.",0

My posts get removed, I do not know why. Here is my situation, I posted about this on tifu and other subreddits. Throwaway account. This did not actually happen today, this has been a huge progressive fuck up that's been building up steam for months now. Please Reddit I need your help, and advice. Please! I've been married for 25 years, currently have 4 kids, and let me tell you when you've been married for this long, lot's of things can get into your head, shit rattles around there, echoes, ferments in a way that other's sometimes just can't comprehend. At times I feel blessed to have been married for so long, but at times living in here Tallahassee, in bum fuck Florida, in a shitty rental just gets to yea, you know? Sometimes the stresses of parenthood can be at times almost suffocating, I hope at least some of you out here, anyone really can just understand where I'm coming from. Working as an insurance broker living paycheck to paycheck wasn't my dream job, yet its the one I have to make due with, but I guess all this shit really started just after my 4th son was born, at home my relationship with my wife begun souring. Bills were piling up, and even after long hard days in the office my wife would yell, and cuss at me for wanting to smoke a pack of marlboro's, and drink some budweiser in peace in my living room, in the house I pay for like I always would but for some stupid ass reason she flipped on me. She began blue balling me since then, she stopped wanting to have fun in bed, time, and time again I would go to her, try to get it on like I had done before, and I just got no love from her, she acted like a cold hearted pasty white bitch, and not just when I was looking to get it on with her. But this pattern, this taboo purgatory I now found myself in, it was nothing temporary it became a new acceptance, a new reality, a new sign of defeat for me. Not only did I now have to put up with a shitty job, in a small home, where I couldn't even relax in peace like I used to, but now my wife was cutting me off from the little bit of pleasure I found being with her. I had dedicated nothing but my whole life, finances, everything I had to our family, and now this is the thanks I got. She would tell me to go, and play, and spend time with the kids like I hadn't, when she knew damn well I was exhausted after work at night times. So I decided from then on I had to do something about this set of unfortunate circumstances I now faced. Inspired to go have some fun, and have finally a release I well deserved; after work I began instead of going straight back to my prison of a home, I instead decided to go out to bars, nightclubs, telling my wife when she texted about where I was, that I was just burning the midnight oil, working hard filing paperwork, just making up job crap she wouldn't even look into anyways. At those clubs I had the time of my life. It became like an addiction to me. For weeks upon weeks I'd go to different nightclubs, and bar hop night after night after work, I didn't just savior my time there I indulged in it, there I'd hook up with women looking for more than just fun. For some reason during this time I was able to hook up with a few local black chicks that'd be hitting the club scene, never in my life did I ever think I as a blond ass kid from Pensacola would I be hooking up like this, most of the times after drinking, and chatting with them, we'd hang out in my car, and have some fun in a parking lot we'd drive to, and spend a few hours at, during this time I'd never use protection, maybe it was the combination of being drunk, or dazed but at that time I just didn't care. During this time I met this hot black chick with an afro, we'll call her ""Mandy"", and after dancing with her at a nightclub late one night we really hit it off, but after my typical one night stand, this girl was different. We grew to have a connection, as days went by we started getting flirty over texts, and soon I grew to have a secret relationship with her, while my wife knew nothing about it. I even took several ""business trips"" to her place during this time. Every time I went it was well worth it. At first she was very sweet to me, and considerate, we even smoked pot together, which for me was a first. Finally for once in my life I thought I had found the perfect work life, sex balance. I'd wake up, say bye to the kids, go to work, afterwards let loose at the clubs till 3am, come back while the wife is asleep, and so on. And finally with Mandy in the mix, I had someone to actually connect to when I wanted. Unlike my wife she was in her early 20s, my wife late 40s, I've seen garbage fires that look better than her. Mandy always gave excellent blowjobs, its like she had lips of an angel, unlike my wife who never gave me oral. But that's when everything went to shit. Mandy came to me two weeks ago, and stated she's pregnant. She took a test, and showed me the results. I don't know what to do, I can't let my wife, or kids find out. Mandy is threatening to tell my wife, about her, and the baby. She has been calling he angrily about this, she blames me for her pregnancy, but she wants to keep that baby. She tells me she doesn't want to be ""just the other woman."" She doesn't want to be ""a dirty little secret."" I don't know what to do. I got so angry at that fucking bitch, we got into a heated argument. I haven't been going to work for the past few days now, I've been making sure Mandy doesn't come to my house, if she does, I'm thinking of calling the cops on that thug. I can't let my wife, or my kids know the truth. I need your help, please, what should I do? I need help, and advice. I want to save the marriage, I can't let my kids go through a divorce, my wife still does not know anything. I hate this whole fucking situation. I hate my life, why the hell would this happen to me?? How can I convince Mandy not to tell my wife? I don't know what to do, should I get a restraining order on her? Please help me anyone, I don't know who to go to for help. TL:DR had several affairs with women I met at nightclubs, hit it off really well with one, now she's pregnant, and wants to tell my wife! Please help me, I don't want to live anymore, I'm thinking of running off, maybe buying a shotgun. Where can I turn to? Help please anyone. My life is worthless. I feel numb inside.",1
188,"To the teenage stranger who got two buses with me to ensure I got home safe.We met one night on the back of the top deck of a bus in the winter of 2007 - I was 12 and earlier that day I found myself in a cab with a man almost 3 times my age, driving to a part of the city I’d never been to before. We arrived at this dirty cramped apartment where there was two men waiting for me. I knew what was expected, this wasn’t the first time I’d been out with this man and this wasn’t the first apartment he’d taken me to but this time I was tired and scared and was still in pain from the last time but as expected shortly after I arrived I was led upstairs by the oldest of the three men. While sitting on the side of the bed I tried to stall, talking too much, taking way too long to untie my shoes and unbutton my coat etc all the while buying time just waiting for the two men downstairs to leave and finally they did and I saw my chance. I jumped up to run but this man who was a lot taller than me caught me and turned me around to face him while holding my wrists in the air as he laughed at my attempt to escape. I was trapped and so I did the first thing I could think of, I jumped up and smashed my head into his mouth hitting his teeth and cutting my head in the process but it forced him to let go of me as he grabbed his mouth and I ran as fast as I could. And so here I was 12 years of age running through the outskirts of the city at about 10:30pm trying to find a bus stop to get home and when I did, I waited there silently sobbing in the middle of winter with blood on my head, no shoes and no coat, just terrified that at any moment that man might come after me but thankfully he didn’t and I got on that bus and went upstairs to one of the seats close to the back of the bus. At this point I had passed multiple people on the streets, about 3 more people passed me waiting at the bus stop and also once the bus arrived I passed the driver who didn’t so much as look up when I was getting in and about 5 people down stairs and a further 3 people upstairs who completely ignored me. Most of them were grown adults. I felt alone, afraid and completely invisible until you stood up from your seat at the back of the bus and came and sat down next to me. Bless you, you were only about 16 you must have been clueless but you done all the right things, took my hand and brought me to the back seat away from the stares of others, put your arm around my shoulders as I cried into your chest, tried to clean the blood from my head with your sleeve, gave me your hoodie and offered to call the police but respected my choice when I said no. You were a guardian angel I needed but didn’t think I deserved. I say that because not only did you do all that, you got off the bus with me in the middle of the city and I tried to give your hoodie back as you asked where I was going. I told you I needed to walk to a different bus stop to get another bus home and your exact words were “that’s mad I’m getting that bus too” and we walked to the bus stop and got on this second bus together and once again we went up to the back of the bus by this point I had stopped crying and had cleaned myself up a bit with your hoodie as you tried to make me laugh, all while not asking too many questions about how I got into this mess which I greatly appreciated. Then my stop arrived and I got up to leave and you said “I’m meant to get off at the next stop but I’ll get off here and we can walk together”, this was perfectly fine with me because despite what men had done to me up until this point, with you I felt safe. We got off the bus, and we walked towards my house and as we got closer I returned your hoodie, gave you a hug, thanked you and turned down the road to my house. It wasn’t until later when I thought back on that night that I realized, you didn’t get up to get off the bus in the city until I did, and you were “getting that bus too” yet when walking to the bus stop you almost made a wrong turn and didn’t know the number of the bus when it was coming down the road, and when you got off a stop early to walk with me we didn’t walk towards the next stop we walked back and around the corner further from the next bus stop you were suppose to be at. Im guessing you were never going my way, probably not even going as far as the city and yet you did all that because you could just tell that I needed it, I just needed somebody to notice me, to care for me and you did that for me. I never got your name and I never seen you again after that and yet in those two hours, two bus journeys, you changed the course of my life. When I was at that first bus stop i was getting ready to end my life, knew were the tablets were and intended to take them all while my mom slept that night, your intervention changed that, gave me hope and a want to live! That cut on my head left me with a small scar but instead of remembering what those men did, every time I looked in the mirror and seen it I thought of you, it gave me strength when I had none and helped me though some really dark times. It’s 13 years later now and I’ve completed over 2 years of counseling, I’ve got a college degree, a well paid career with great future prospects, I’m planning on buying my own house next year with enough room for plenty of animals and I’m happier than I could have ever imagined, and none of this would have ever happened if it wasn’t for the selfless act of your teenage self . So thank you, I can truly say that I owe you my life and wherever you are in the world I hope you have the best life possible because you deserve the very best. EDIT: thank you all so much for your lovely supportive replies. this is something that was very difficult for me to share but I did so in the hopes that the boy from that night might see it and know the impact he had on my life but in the mean time you all ensured I had no reason to fear, it’s so uplifting to feel the love from you all and not have anyone judge me for the situation I got myself into. Also: without revealing much information as I would like to remain anonymous I would ask that if this story sounds familiar to you and if that night you were a young teenage boy with spiked black hair and I blue zipped hoodie that ended up covered in blood, please message me, I would love to thank you personally for what you did for me that night EDIT2: reposting without heart emoji as last post was removed",0

190,"I’m almost ready to die, every day makes me feel closer to being able to be brave enough to end my lifeI’ve spent so long living day by day, year by year, trying to fix how I am and who I am. Pretending I could be better, that I could get better. But I can’t. I’m broken. I’m not a real human being, I’m a sad pathetic man with nothing that wasn’t handed to me automatically. I’m 27 now. No friends. Virgin who’s never had a girlfriend. Never had a job. My brain is fucked and I can’t be normal no matter how much I wish I could be. I can’t enjoy anything. Distractions are the best things can be to me now, mainly watching tv and film and pretending I don’t exist. Food tastes like ash. Sleep is the only time I feel ok. I sleep a lot. Even the nightmares are better than being awake. The anti depressants have just made me feel numb, with the bonus of making my dick not work. So I can’t even jerk off now. One of the few pleasures I had left. Sometimes I sit at a coffee shop, and watch all the people walking by. Couples. Workers. Teens. The elderly. I wish I could be like them, I wish I could have relationships. I wish I could kiss a girl who loves me. I wish I could have sex with someone attracted to me. I wish I could work a job. I wish I didn’t need pills to stop anxiety making me wanna vomit from basic human interaction. I wish I could hang out with friends and talk. I wish I didn’t have so many failures and zero successes. This isn’t how human beings are meant to live. I’ve planned a pretty good method to end my life, just need to visit some people who care about me so I can say goodbye in my own way, hopefully it’ll give them some measure of closure when they think back. Think I’ll also write a note to let them all know that none of it was their fault and there was nothing they could have done to stop me ending things. I hope I have the courage to end my life soon. I hate living like this.",1

193,"On the 15th of Jan I was ready to end it all.On the 15th of Jan I was completely ready to end my life. I wrote my suicide notes in both English and Arabic, I've set an auto post on my Facebook. I was going to go on with it without a doubt, I had my medication that I was going to OD on and I was also ready to self-harm myself, but I didn't. I stopped half way through, crying so hard I did want the people that loved me to feel what I was feeling, I didn't want them to suffer nor blame themselves like I blame myself for my best friend's suicide. I felt that is wasn't fair to do that to them even though ending it all will end my pain but it will only start the pain of others and I don't want that. I don't want to hurt people, even though I don't deserve anything and everything they have given me it's not fair for them to carry my burden with them. I still don't know how I managed to stop myself, I have thoughts everyday of how I'm going to do it but I stop every time because I don't want to hurt people.

But I am ready for death. This is, it's really something I can't explain. I've felt this way just for a short while. But I feel as if I'm going to die soon, but not by my own hands. Nor anyone elses. I don't understand why I feel this way. My life is going great. I'm actually going to the doctors tomorrow for an exam, and I have this feeling they're going to discover something terrible. But it's funny, because I know they will. How? I don't know. I don't know how to explain it. I don't feel guilty or bad, I just accept it for what it is. Part of me wishes it was me being paranoid. But I know that isn't it. If you asked me to fully describe how I feel, I feel like I'm ready to go home. Weird isn't it?",1
196,"[Vent] I'm scared for the end of my dogs life, and I'll never be ready or able to cope with it.I rescued my 2 dogs when they were 5 and (guessing) 3. I'm losing track of time honestly, but I reckon that makes my Lab 11 now, and my Husky 8. From the moment I got them, I was in love. They are my best friends/family/kids. I know you all are the same, but I take it to another level - partly due to a traumatic experience which I just can't shake. There was a period of 19 months in the middle of that where I didn't have them due to a bitter ""divorce"". MY defacto ex committed fraud and stole them both and used them as pawns, and I had to sacrifice everything I had to get them back. ALL my money, and almost every moment of that time was spent researching legal principles, and trying to figure out how to see them again, and wondering what I did to deserve it. During that time, in addition to crushing depression, I'd have the most vivid nightmares. One of them involved her deciding to ""split"" them. But we weren't taking one each (as she was trying to do in real life). In this dream, she got the heads, and I got the bodies. It wasn't a dream where that somehow made sense and they were ok. They were dead. It was graphic. In the dream, I had to go to court (which is what I was really facing) to try to put them back together and bring them back to life. I woke up in tears, and it took a few minutes to realise it wasn't real. I'd like to say that kind of thing is behind me, because it sort of is. The happy ending is that after a 19 month, expensive, painful struggle, she gave them back (to avoid the court action and financial consequences), and they've been with me ever since. But you don't just get over that, and it's left me with lasting mental health issues in general, but largely about the dogs. I actually think I might have PTSD. In the first few months of getting them back, I was elated. I actually hadn't been able to work much leading up to that anyway due to crippling depression, and directing my energy and resources to self representing in court. But once I got them back, all I wanted to do was be with them. I am a freelance photographer and took the odd job if it came my way, but I didn't try to find any new work. I didn't care. All I wanted was to reconnect with my dogs - my kids. That's STILL all I want. I'm working more now because I have to, but the more I do, the less I get to see them, and the more I develop a new fear - that particularly with my Lab, I may not have long left. My Husky is perfect. Could pass for a puppy. And other than being a slight chonker, my lab is in great health. He still chases my Husky in short bursts, walks every day, and other than a few old people things like creaky joints, he's fine. I wouldn't be surprised if he lasted 6 or 7 more years. I know death is something all dog owners face. It's a given, and I knew what I was signing up for. If none of the above had ever happened, I'd still be devastated when that day came. But after what I went through... I'm legitimately terrified that I'll wake up one morning and he won't, or that I'll have to make an impossible decision. I don't even know which is worse. But it's on my mind way too often considering I have no reason to think it's going to happen any time soon. It's irrational to think about right now, but I just can't get it out of my mind. Sometimes I look at them, and out of nowhere, I just for some reason involuntarily imagine what it would be like without them (sort of remembering how it was when I didn't have access to them at all), and I go stone cold. And it's happening more and more. I can't lose them again, but I know that I will. I know I should just enjoy the time we have now, and believe me, I am. Parks, beaches, play, treats, and I have barely taken a photo or video of a subject besides them in over a year. I'm kind of socially awkward and weird about it now. I prefer them to most human contact, which is how it was before. ;) But x 10. Travel that takes me away from them for more than a few days scares the shit out of me and I actively avoid it. My ageing parents live interstate and I haven't been home since I got them back. My parents came to me once though, and I'm hoping that I can find 3-5 days early in the new year to get home - but once upon a time, travel was my life and a week was a short trip, and a month was average. But now... I'm trying to find ways to make trips go as fast as possible or avoid them entirely - all because I can't be away from them. I'm single, and if a girl invites me over, my first thought is that I don't want to leave the dogs alone for the night. If she meets them and doesn't go crazy for them, or doesn't want to share the bed with them, she's out. No joke. I can't be apart from them, and I can't form attachments with people who don't get it. And you know what? That's extreme, but that's ok with me. I've done my travel. I have some good people around me who can take care of the dogs for short periods so I can see my family and friends back home, which is the only thing that could make me want to get on a plane right now. And I like to think that ""My girl"" would find my love for them endearing. She'd be the same about her dogs, or would adopt mine with me and we'd live happily ever after. All that is to say that these dogs... they're everything to me. My life revolves around them, and I think largely because of what happened, it goes well beyond ""loving my dogs"" and more towards I am genuinely petrified of the day when I lose them and my entire world crumbles... again, and I'll be back in that dark place I was when I was without them, only with no hope of a return. And it's not if, it's when. And I don't know what to do.",0

Here is my situation, I posted about this on tifu. Throwaway account. This did not actually happen today, this has been a huge progressive fuck up that's been building up steam for months now. Please Reddit I need your help, and advice. Please! I've been married for 25 years, currently have 4 kids, and let me tell you when you've been married for this long, lot's of things can get into your head, shit rattles around there, echoes, ferments in a way that other's sometimes just can't comprehend. At times I feel blessed to have been married for so long, but at times living in here Tallahassee, in bum fuck Florida, in a shitty rental just gets to yea, you know? Sometimes the stresses of parenthood can be at times almost suffocating, I hope at least some of you out here, anyone really can just understand where I'm coming from. Working as an insurance broker living paycheck to paycheck wasn't my dream job, yet its the one I have to make due with, but I guess all this shit really started just after my 4th son was born, at home my relationship with my wife begun souring. Bills were piling up, and even after long hard days in the office my wife would yell, and cuss at me for wanting to smoke a pack of marlboro's, and drink some budweiser in peace in my living room, in the house I pay for like I always would but for some stupid ass reason she flipped on me. She began blue balling me since then, she stopped wanting to have fun in bed, time, and time again I would go to her, try to get it on like I had done before, and I just got no love from her, she acted like a cold hearted pasty white bitch, and not just when I was looking to get it on with her. But this pattern, this taboo purgatory I now found myself in, it was nothing temporary it became a new acceptance, a new reality, a new sign of defeat for me. Not only did I now have to put up with a shitty job, in a small home, where I couldn't even relax in peace like I used to, but now my wife was cutting me off from the little bit of pleasure I found being with her. I had dedicated nothing but my whole life, finances, everything I had to our family, and now this is the thanks I got. She would tell me to go, and play, and spend time with the kids like I hadn't, when she knew damn well I was exhausted after work at night times. So I decided from then on I had to do something about this set of unfortunate circumstances I now faced. Inspired to go have some fun, and have finally a release I well deserved; after work I began instead of going straight back to my prison of a home, I instead decided to go out to bars, nightclubs, telling my wife when she texted about where I was, that I was just burning the midnight oil, working hard filing paperwork, just making up job crap she wouldn't even look into anyways. At those clubs I had the time of my life. It became like an addiction to me. For weeks upon weeks I'd go to different nightclubs, and bar hop night after night after work, I didn't just savior my time there I indulged in it, there I'd hook up with women looking for more than just fun. For some reason during this time I was able to hook up with a few local black chicks that'd be hitting the club scene, never in my life did I ever think I as a blond ass kid from Pensacola would I be hooking up like this, most of the times after drinking, and chatting with them, we'd hang out in my car, and have some fun in a parking lot we'd drive to, and spend a few hours at, during this time I'd never use protection, maybe it was the combination of being drunk, or dazed but at that time I just didn't care. During this time I met this hot black chick with an afro, we'll call her ""Mandy"", and after dancing with her at a nightclub late one night we really hit it off, but after my typical one night stand, this girl was different. We grew to have a connection, as days went by we started getting flirty over texts, and soon I grew to have a secret relationship with her, while my wife knew nothing about it. I even took several ""business trips"" to her place during this time. Every time I went it was well worth it. At first she was very sweet to me, and considerate, we even smoked pot together, which for me was a first. Finally for once in my life I thought I had found the perfect work life, sex balance. I'd wake up, say bye to the kids, go to work, afterwards let loose at the clubs till 3am, come back while the wife is asleep, and so on.

200,"4 year anniversary & speaker shareHi room: I'm celebrating 4 years of back-to-back sobriety from alcohol and addictive sex/love behaviors!!! What a fucking miracle that I am alive, want to be alive, and am living sober. I'm speaking in one of my communities which requests scripts (because of online medium) and I thought I'd share it here for anyone who is interested... It's focused on sex/love but, eh, I think one addictive banana is just a part of the whole bunch. And it's 12-step focused. That's definitely not the only path and it's not even my only path (I also like Buddhist recovery and I've benefited from a generous helping of medical assistance) but, it's the speaker share I wrote, so I'd love to share it with y'all. I wish everyone a contented sober day with enough pain to want to change and enough courage to get it done. xo \- With a lot of joy, a little disbelief, and tremendous gratitude, I celebrated 4 years of back-to-back sobriety from sex and love addiction two days ago. (My sobriety date is January 13, 2016.) I will use the typical 12 step speaker format of what it was like, what happened, and what it’s like now. I would also like to suggest not only to the newcomer, but also to the old-timer, and everyone in between, to practice open-mindedness in listening today. With any story—whether I participated in those behaviors and thoughts or didn’t—there will be things that I can relate with and things that I cannot. It is my responsibility to find the commonality, take what I can for today, and leave the rest to think about later. So, about me, and what happened. I had a challenging childhood. I believe two early attachment ruptures contributed to my addiction. I also believe my paternal genetic lineage of mental illness, alcoholism, and completed suicide contributed to my addiction. In short, by the time I was about 7, the slingshot of addiction was loaded and pulled back. So I’m 7 and I start having “boyfriends”. The difference between my “boyfriends” and those of my classmates was, I believe, my obsession and the feeling in my chest of wanting to be loved and consumed, even from a young age. I remember once being in the car having broken up with one 7-year-old “boyfriend” and I said “I am so free now! I can do what I want!” Love addict early on. From 7 to 12 I was having these non-sexual but fantasized-about boyfriends in school and on the bus and on the street. At 12 I discovered my first drug: my asthma inhaler. I also discovered lying. I did not tell my parents why I needed so many inhalers—practicing addicts are remarkably selfish and I did not care that they were expensive, but of course I was also a child without much ability to take perspective—I just lied that they went off randomly in my backpack. I discovered my first drug and I also started drinking. So now I’m 13 and I have discovered drugs, alcohol, and “older boys”, which leads me to my first real sexual experience while drinking straight, cheap vodka from water bottles at a public swimming pool with an older boy. I had both the “sex” and “love” aspects of sex and love addiction, though they would eventually intertwine. When I was 14 I was in a relationship with a boy whom I fantasized that I would marry and I had sex for the first time—he was 4 years my senior. When I was 15 he “ghosted me” and I could not understand, I called him obsessively, and this obsessive calling became a hallmark feature of my love addiction. At about age 15 I began running, playing sports, and engaging in bulimia (purging and exercise). Now the trifecta had come to fruition and that addiction slingshot—which had been loaded and pulled back from a young age—fired, with no undo button. So here’s the addictive trifecta for me: boys, booze, bulimia. I wanted love, I would go out on weekends as a teenager, drink to blackout, which lessened my shame, helped my social anxiety, and allowed me to do things I was otherwise ashamed of. I would wake up, obsess about the guy(s) from before, they would naturally not care, and then I would binge and purge to make myself feel better. I would feel fat, and need a partner to ""love"" me, and tell me I was pretty. I used physical sex as a placeholder for love and being told I’m pretty. So the next time I could, I would do the cycle again. And this occurred from ages 15 – 26. Within that timeframe I had many accomplishments: graduating high school with honors, year-long relationships, graduating college summa cum laude, working at a highly prestigious university... I also had many challenges: several medical withdrawals, growing suicidality as part of bipolar disorder, social isolation, constant misery, liver malfunction, incurable STI’s (two of them), online and camera acting out, unbearable shame, panic attacks every day towards the end. I always felt like I was not enough, or worse, I was too much, annoying, and you were going to leave me, and then I would die. I had no friends. By this point I’m 26 and I am ready to end my life because to continue in this way is futile. I had yet another blackout night culminating in a dehumanizing one-night-stand.Mind you—I joined 12 step programs when I was 19 (food related) then 20 (alcohol) then 24 (SLAA) so I was convinced that nothing would work for me. I had already tried sponsors, the steps, I couldn’t stay sober to save my life (literally), and I was ready to die. I was so low that the only reason I didn’t enact my plan was it would halt public transportation, and I didn’t want my death to ruin anyone’s work commute. I called my psychiatrist because I trusted her, and I didn’t know what to do. On January 13, 2016 she met me at the hospital and had me admitted into a dual-diagnosis unit. That means I am formally diagnosed with addiction and mental illness. Here I was well-medicated and a straight-shooting nurse told me, “If you drink, you will die.” I said , ""No no no you don’t get it, I’ve already done AA, I’ve already done all this stuff, it doesn’t work."" She replied, “I don’t care what you do or don’t do, you just can’t drink.” So I spent two weeks in this dual-diagnosis unit where I engaged in intrigue with other patients. I decided to stop drinking alcohol through self-will and would fix my life through becoming the perfect worker, the perfect employee, and would work myself into a better life. Three months later I’m at my next psychiatric ward, again suicidal. Those three months of intensive professional work and white-knuckle sobriety (alcohol and sex and love) did not fix the fundamental problem which for me I believe is existential, spiritual… I believe my fundamental problem is NOT that I act out, or that I have the wrong partner, or that I don’t have a partner, or that the sex isn’t this way, or that I'm not loved the right way… I believe my fundamental problem is that I have a god-shaped hole in my chest that I try to shove full of addictive content, but it will never feel whole and full that way and it will continue consuming and consuming until I give it the right sustenance, which is connection. So after my second psychiatric ward stay I realized inwardly what it says in the book Alcoholics Anonymous (also known as the Big Book) that I was “unable to imagine life either with alcohol or without it” (pg. 165). I tried drinking and grabbing at love which landed me in the psych ward. I tried abstaining which landed me in the psych ward. I realized that, as the Big Book says on that same page, the fellowship of the spirit was what would bring me contentment, joy, and meaning. At this point I became deadly serious about surrender. The basics of early recovery for me included: no-contact with men (more than 6 months), no relationships (about one year), daily meetings and stepwork. The basic purpose of not talking to men has nothing to do with gender or gender identity. It is that I needed to stop using sex, flirtation, and intrigue as social currency. With women, I had to be a real person to find friendship and camaraderie, and so I developed a community of women. “Time takes time” is a wonderful motto. I took this time in early recovery to stabilize myself physically, to orient myself as a 12-stepper, and to dig deep into spiritual reflection through stepwork. I have had many wonderful sponsors over time. The worst of my sponsors told me what to do and tried to control me. I now know, this is totally natural for an addict to do, but it is not the way to a spiritual awakening. The best of my sponsors taught me to take inventory, trust, pray, meditate, and practice selfless service. They put my hand into the god-hand. The best of my sponsors used the Basic Text and Big Book to lift me up towards god, rather than to beat me down into a false humility. Ultimately I did find more and more of what I wanted in recovery: the dignity of choice, open-minded and curious spiritual exploration, freedom from addiction. Most of all I grew over time to authentically love myself. I love this line from our SLAA Basic Text at the end of Chapter 5, The Withdrawal Experience: “Amidst all difficulties and uncertainties, a simple intimacy had come into being for us: we had met ourselves, and found ourselves worthy. We had become “beloved” to ourselves.” When I was in my addiction, I could not fathom finding myself worthy. I had a whole host of bad names for myself and reasons why I wasn’t acceptable, which fueled my need to find another person to tell me I was acceptable, and to pump that god-shaped hole in my heart full of addictive garbage. I wasn’t worth it, so why would I care? Yet, today, I am worth it, and I have internalized the love so freely given me in SLAA and other 12-step rooms. To the newcomer who wants a suggestion—I suggest identifying people with whom you won’t use sex and social currency, and developing recovery community with them based in honesty and integrity. I suggest working the steps over and over and over again: “time takes time” and these spiritual lessons are not quick to learn. I suggest staying sober, because if you can relate with me...you probably need it to stay alive. On the practical topic of bottom lines, each of us will have our own, so I'll share about just my main one: I don’t practice infidelity. Infidelity is any behavior which I would not do in front of my partner (from sex to secret messages to long hugs). To my inner addict, that is a radical, impossible standard! But it is possible in recovery. Today I am sober from bottom lines in SLAA, alcohol and related substances in AA for 4 years. I have an amazing romantic partner, we are planning a life together. I have a cat who has never seen me drink! :D I am close with my family. I am still reactive, angry, and selfish—but not nearly as much and not nearly as frequently. I have faith. I am special, but not unique. What a fun freedom: to love myself without narcissism, to love you without abandoning myself. The freedom of recovery is yours, too, should you choose to pursue it. Remember to pause to hear the quiet voice of god. Find your recovery tribe—stay in the middle of the herd. Quit filling the god-shaped hole with garbage, one day at a time. You deserve better, I know it even if you're not sure yet. Start filling yourself with faith as you understand faith. You can find it taking the 12 steps. And, for you and for me, more will be revealed.",0

202,"My life-long best friend ended our friendship, and I’m finally ready to talk about it.*TL;DR - Best friend of 18yrs ended our relationship after telling me I was going to be his best man, ghosts me for months, then tells me our beliefs and ideals are different I’m uninvited to the wedding and good luck with my life.* This happened this past May, and I’ve thought about it every single day since then. He and I first met in 1st grade just about 18 years ago through a mutual friend at a birthday party. We immediately hit it off, the whole traditional best friend type stuff of every weekend at one another’s house, going on vacations together, being called family, spending the entire summers together, etc... We were both there for the relationship up and downs, the whole puberty thing where we were going some real weird shit - essentially we were attached at the hip and were “best friends”. In high school, about 10th grade he moved away to another state but was close enough to visit during the summers. This didn’t really stop our relationship and we both skyped, texted, and instant messaged through various gaming platforms. Video games became a huge part of our relationship, each and every weekend consisted of Skype calls lasting 5-8 hours all while playing games online and learning the ins and outs of coding. We kept our relationship strong even though there was distance between us. College came around, we moved further away and eventually stopped the weekend Skyped and stuff but still managed to text each other quite often. Everyday grew to every other day, then that grew to every week to every other week and so on until it was every once in awhile. I felt like nothing changed, we still talked easily and conversation never felt labored. The end of our college career was marked by his proposal to his girlfriend I thirdwheeled with for years. After the deal was done he texted me “proposed to her and she said yes, get your measurements for your tux!”. Dope, the whole wedding thing as best friends was expected by both of our families, me being the best man and watching my best friend marry the love of his life. Time started passing and I never got an update for the wedding, but managed to get my measurements and stuff ready on my end. Conversation passed as usual, but the wedding was never mentioned which I thought was weird but let it slide. Months go by, and I start getting worried about being out of the loop. It’s now 2 months before the wedding. (Texting) Me: hey dude! Hope your midterm went well. Kind of out of the loop with the wedding, I have my measurements. What do I need to do? Him (a couple days later): Hey. So I should have been more clear, there’s a reason you haven’t heard anything or received a wedding invitation. He goes on to explain that we’ve drifted apart and our relationship wasn’t what it used to be. He felt our conversations were labored (I didn’t) and how our “beliefs and ideals” are different than one another. He then wished me luck in life and basically said good bye. That was the last I heard of him, I sent a text congratulating him and I expressed my confusion but understanding. No reply. This has been incredibly hard, I still don’t believe it’s real and I cry often about it.",0
203,"my life isnt the best and im ready for it to end Hi, You don’t know me and I don't know you and I hope it stays that way. I don’t think I'm cut out for the world. There's too much pressure on my shoulders. I’m cracking from it. I find that im just bored. Kinda empty. I feel lonely in a world filled with millions of people. I just don’t think i’m really cut out for life. I’m not attractive, i’m not rich, my genetics suck ass. I don’t think i’m going anywhere. I guess I'll tell you about my life and views. I don’t think im gonna last past 20. Hell im 13 and im already struggling. I come from a family of 8. Mom dad sister sister me sister brother baby brother. My parents don’t live in the same house anymore. I think it’s my fault. I hated my dad. He always yelled, screamed and beat me ( he still yells and screams but physical discipline has gone down for me my baby brother not so much but thats different). I hated his yelling. And i still do. It’s overwhelming and makes me feel really bad. My mom is sweet but she can be a bit manipulative. My older sister sucks. I hate her a lot. In fact i hate all of my family. Except for my baby brother for now. I love him with my heart. The only reason i think my dad is so yelly and strict is because of my sister ( the oldest). 2-3 years ago my sister decided she was gonna make hell for our family. When my parents went to work for the summer we were supposed to clean the house. Instead she’d lock us out of her room and have sex with one of her friends. My second older sister revealed this to my family later after she went under surgery. It was a huge deal at the time, but I don't remember much information. After that she got caught smoking weed in the bathroom. I still remember my dad running into the room ( I was in the room with her and other sister) with a belt. And I covered my head because for some reason I thought he was going to hit me. He hit her a lot with the belt even though she said stop but idk. My grandma later took my older sister into “custody”. That's when my moms side of the family began hating my dads side. My older sister later got caught having cut marks on her arms and got sent away to this camp. And not gonna lie i want to be sent to a camp like that just to get away from my family. Currently there's two houses my moms and my dads. My dad's house is old and tacky. The sink is leaking and there's a moldy tin beneath it. There's ants, spiders, everywhere. There's mushrooms growing beneath the sink. It just overall doesn't look nice and i'm embarrassed of it. My mom's house is nicer and more touched up but there are a lot more people living in the house to help with rent. It was just supposed to be me, mom, 2nd oldest sister, youngest sister, brother, baby brother and my cousin. My moms friend got evicted and shes staying in the room i'm supposed to stay in. my uncle is there too along with my oldest sister whos supposed to be in college but we can’t afford it so she currently is not attending. I dislike my family for a lot of reasons. They are loud, very harsh and critical and it sucks. I have very low self esteem already and their comments on my looks and the clothes I wear are very destructive. Comments like “you hair is so nappy” “why do you look like that” “what are you wearing” “you look hideous” it just hurts. And maybe these words don’t affect you but they affect me. They may not know it, but I hate myself. I’m just really unattractive and my popularity suffers from it. I don’t even know who I am anymore. Its like even when I find someone who has a couple things in common with me, I'm never gonna find where I truly belong. I'm too weird and I hate it. Today's society is all about luscious curves and full hips. Meanwhile i have very small narrow hips that are smaller than my shoulders. Im skinny and muscular and can’t wear the clothes I want to wear. I only wear bagging clothes. Clothes that don't show the figure. I don't go to the pool anymore. And if I do go to the pool I always wear a long shirt over my bikini or don’t go in the water. I don’t know why im just so hideous. It’s like nothing im doing is working. I've tried working out, subliminals, nothing just nothing and nothing. Just things have become so empty and hopeless. My family doesn't even care about me. They keep forgetting about me. I’m the one person in the house who needs clothes and shoes. My entire wardrobe should not fit in the same drawer. I know there are people who are less fortunate than me and have no clothes but that doesn't make it suck any less. I go to school surrounded by rich people. And I can't help but look at myself and wonder what i'm doing wrong. It's like everyday people around me are happy and living their best life meanwhile im just existing. In fact i'm barely doing that. It sucks so much. I’m in the gifted art program for virginia. My family expects so much of me. They are expecting me to go to college with scholarships from art dance and music and all that and it's overwhelming. I don’t even know what I want to be when I get older yet everyone around me seems to have a goal and is so close to it. Everyone around me has a huge social media platform. Everyone around me is so successful and looking into a bright future. I don’t even know if i'm gonna be there in the future. I don’t want to be. I'm just tired of living on this earth. The earth where its a burden for me to be an african american. It's so terrifying for me. I gave my family members telling me stories of how they've been mistreated by society and it makes me nervous. I don’t want to die, i just want to sleep. I fear that one day I'm just gonna be at the wrong place at the wrong time and experience pain, that some cop is gonna think im holding a gun and shoot, and that they are going to get away with it. That someones gonna frame me for something I didn't do and i'm gonna suffer. I'm suffering right now. I don’t want to suffer anymore. I don’t want to die from someone else, in fact i don’t want to die when i'm not ready. I Want to die when im ready. And right now I kinda feel like i'm ready. I just don't feel like im set out for this place. Everyday is just 24 hours of me suffering. I feel just so unlucky. I lost hope completely. Iu don’t wake up refreshed and eager to start a new day I start new days waking up wishing I could go back to sleep. Wishing that my dreams were real because at least in my dreams I can smile and laugh for once. At Least in my dreams I can live the life I always wanted without facing judgement. Because judgement just sucks. Everywhere I go there are eyes watching and judging me. Theres so many people that want to harm and torture people. Innocent people. People like me who just don’t have a care for the world. I lost passion for everything. I'm just stressed. I’m not who I was anymore. Instead of enjoying things i'm just trying to distract myself. Distract myself from death. Distract myself from the world. Distract myself from my financial issues. I might not be able to dance anymore. I was supposed to get a solo. All of my friends around me got one. My teacher even said i would. But then on picture day I walk into the room and she pulls me aside and tells me i wont get one. And it doesnt fucking help that everyone around me is bragging about their solos. In Fact everyone is bragging about something I don't have. And it's so hard to be happy for people when i'm not even happy for myself. We re 10,000 fucking dollars in dance debt. We owe 2,000 for our electric bill. The lights are off at my moms house. And fuck yeah im crying right now. I cry all the time. No one cares anymore. All the love I had for people around me is just gone. And I'm trying to be optimistic about things. I'm trying to look at things with a “maybe something good will happen” but the outcome is always the same. Everyday is just a bad day now. A single inconvenience just washes what was meant to be a good day down the drain. It gotten so bad that i just sleep just to get a break. I sleep just to have what feels like a few minutes of happiness. I wish i could sleep longer sometimes. Hell falling asleep is getting harder for me. Melatonin doesn't work anymore. I don’t want to be awake. I don't want to be awake anymore. Everything, and I mean everything is just crumbling for me. The people I thought I could trust and love are stabbing me in the backs and at this point I doubt they'd care if I died. Hell i wouldn't care if i die. It's just that death, death is appealing. If i don't wish it on myself i wish it on others. People, things are just destructive. And they won't go away. I just really really really need a break from things. I don’t want my suicide to be painful. I don’t want to drown. I don’t want to shoot or stab myself. I want it to be quick and effective. Maybe for my birthday ill ask to go skydiving and i won’t pull the parachute. Maybe ill just jump off an apartment building. I might be alive for now. Maybe for the next few minutes, or a couple of days maybe a year. I’m miserable, and im not ready to continue living right now. I can’t keep living like this because it hurts and I want it to stop. And no. no one knows how I feel. I told a few people but they weren't as helpful as I thought. It didn’t make me feel better, just made me feel hopeless. My parents, they don't care. They know how I feel but haven't done shit. I cant do shit. I'm responsible for the death of Alexis D, or atleast im going to be. Thanks for letting me vent for a moment.",1
204,"I don’t want to continueI am completely alone as I don’t have anyone to care about or anyone who cares about me. I can’t make friends and I don’t know why cause I try so hard. In school I did all sorts of clubs to try to make new friends but it always ended up that I would be excluded from the “main group” (not sure if there’s a word for what I’m trying to say). The most I ever got was someone talking to me because they needed something from me. I got so desperate I joined a couple of churches but ultimately left cause I just couldn’t relate to any of those people. The one person I did have,who was my only friend in high school, told me he’s too busy to spend any more time with me, so now I don’t even have anyone to confide in. I also ended up dropping out of school cause my grades were so bad I couldn’t hope to graduate on time and my family can’t afford to pay for more than 4 years and now my parents are disappointed in me for wasting their money. And now I feel like all I am is a problem. I started cutting myself cause it makes me feel a little better when I do and I think I’m about ready to end my life. I was prepared to do it yesterday, wrote a note and everything, but my dad’s gun wasn’t in it’s normal place and I couldn’t find it. Worse comes to worse I’ll buy my own. I’d prefer a gun cause I just want it to be quick.",1
205,"I recovered from cancer twice and might metastase again, and no one seems to understand how much impact this makes on my life.Hey peeps. I never feel i can talk about this, even on reddit. People seem to think i make things up. It is really hurtful. From my 11th i have been walking around with nerve pain, which got worse to an indescribable pain. No doctor seemed to be able to find the caise of my pain and no one took me serious. I was ready to end my life when i turned 15. A few months later i got diagnosed with a benign tumour in my spinal canal which compressed my nerves at L5-S1 level (lower back), and was removed successfully. 10 years later i was declared cured. 2 years after that, the cancer came back. T was worse. The pain was unbearable. Some people tried to tell me it was all in my head. Turned out that this tumour was really bad because it was completely stuck between my nerves and the scar tissue from the last surgery. I got surgery, and most of it got removed, but not all. This was more than a year ago and i stull have a lot of pain, due to my damaged nerves. Pretty soon after my surgery i picked up my studies again, despite coming off heavy opioids and other medication. No one seems to notice how strong i have been and no one realizes where i went through. Somehow it just hurts me a lot that people won’t acknowledge my illness and what kind of impact this made on my life. I live in constant pain. I live in uncertainty because there is a good chance that it will come back with an even worse outcome. This time only my bladder and bowel nerve got damaged, so i cannot go to the toilet very well. I also lost sensation in my left leg. I learned to walk straight again. Off course i am keeping my head of and staying positive. Even when i am hanging out with friends, they sometimes talk about that one of them ever had cancer or a family member had it. Everyone is like ‘wow man, that’s something!’ And they ask a ton of questions and are super supportive And somehow they think i am this stone, not needing any support. I’m sorry i just need to vent. I don’t expect any support but i surely hope to get it somewhere.",0

My life has always been shit and ive always had the thought of killing myself but ive never had the guts to. Well not until now. Like I said my life has always been shit but at the start of 2019 it got so much worse, I meet so many amazing people and managed to mess up with worseall of them to the point they now hate me and openly express that hate to me. Most of the people who I talk to about this just say things like if they left then obviously they weren't meant for u, but I don't see it like that. I see as I messed up and hurt so I don't deserve to live. I've made a promise to myself that when I hurt someone I have to hurt myself in return. But people leaving my life aren't the only reason I'm going to end my life, I've had severe depression and anxiety since I was about 10 years old and I've always hated myself for everything I do, the way I look ect. When I meet new people I always try to warn them about how I'm a bad person but they never believe me but I've hurt people, destroyed peoples live, destroyed things, I've shot ice, I've done coke, I've done LSD, MDMA and ecstasy.I have stabbed people. I have beaten the shit out of people and robbed them. I've done so much bad shit and what I just listed then doesn't even scratch the surface of what I've done. I want to kill myself so I can no longer hurt people, weather there a random person or someone I love, and yes by killing myself I will hurt them but that bit of pain would be better then the pain I would inflict on them while being alive. So this is why I am gonna kill myself, and what I have listed is only some of the reasons I'm going to do this. I have written my suicide note and I have tied the noose and set it up so sometime tonight I am hopefully going to end my life and stop the pain for myself and everyone who knows me.",1

210,"My(our)story This is a lot to read, but any time you give will be greatly appreciated. I just wanted to get this of my chest and I know my girl checks here often. I(m19)have battled really bad depression for years. I'm on the autistic spectrum and have aspergers syndrome. And one of the 'side affects' of my condition is I'm constantly on a extremely high level of stress in my body. I may not always feel stress but according to my body we are always just in extreme danger. And because of that my body has swelled up making me look fat even though I actually live very healthy, eat well, and get exercise. And I've always hated my body. I've tried so hard, going to the gym regularly and dieting to try and change it but nothing worked. When I was 13 I had sexually molested my younger sister and I've never been able to forgive myself. Thankfully she doesn't remember, but that shadow of what I've done has weighed me down since then. I always felt I would never be loved. I thought I would be alone forever. And I wasn't even sure I could let someone be with me because of how horrible I thought I was. From the incident with my sister and never being able to forgive myself I was ready to end my life. The world felt empty to me. There are only a few reasons I didn't end it all. I got into video games heavily at the time because it distracted me from the life I hated so much. And I stopped loving for myself. I had no drive for the future. I didn't want anything anymore. But I felt I had a mission. That I was put in certain peoples lives to heal them. And so I made that my life goal. I helped the people I felt I needed to till I was about18-19. By that point I had a friend group that was considered family more than anything else. But through certain events I became really close with two of the friends. Let's call them S. And P.. I got involved in a polyamorous relationship with S. And P. Because P. Had told me that she liked me. And for me it was like a drug. If it was a chance that someone actually liked me for me I had to take it. I soon realized what a bad decision that was. I was barely even an extra. They were 'married' but weren't legally married. I gave her affection and love in hopes for some in return but I didn't get much. I mainly got dragged in because S. Had an extra as well, her name was Rebekah. And S. Started to give her more Attention than P. And P. Felt left out. So I got involved to fill in where S. Couldn't. And during that period Rebekah had something happen in her family. She reached out to me as her friend and I was able to comfort her as things were starting to get Rocky with her side of the relationship thing. She got closer with me and asked if she could see me being with her. I politely declined because at the time I couldn't do anything to displease P. Out of sheer fear that I was gonna lose what little part of her I had. And so things continued with our relationship thing and I continued to feel drained of everything and getting nothing in return because I never felt loved enough. And that wasn't enough for me and it actually drove me insane. It was tearing me apart. I wanted her to myself but I couldn't say that. I didn't want to tear apart my 2 best friends. I eventually had to leave the relationship. I was broken again for a few days when. I made the decision. I knew what I wanted in a relationship but again I felt I would never have a good one. Then on Xmas night of 2019 I started messaging S.'s extra, Rebekah. I told her that I was leaving the relationship because it wasn't enough. Through talking about it all we realized we both wanted the same thing in a relationship. I ended things with S. And P. That night. She did the next day since things were already dry between her and S. And we met up the next day. From when I first saw her again and hugged her, I felt loved. I didn't know how to process it immediately. It felt nicer that anything else in my life. The comfort of holding her in my arms was indescribable. We talked for a few days after that, our feelings growing stronger by the day, and everything we learned about eachother, our likes and dislikes, our dreams and aspirations, and what we wanted in a relationship lined up so indescribably perfectly. I fell more in love with her with every new thing I learned about her. Our second day we actually got together as a couple, I couldn't hold it anymore. I told her I loved her, and she said it back, and everything stopped. Inside, the steel that trapped my heart shattered. All the pain and insecurities I had faded away for the time. I cried because I couldn't hold in how it felt. I felt loved. I told her what I had done to my sister, and she didn't look at me any different. She even said she loved me more because she knew the real me and that I was able to tell her. She loves my body. She finds me sexy even. In just the short time that we've been together I have fallen even deeper in love with her every day. I've never been happier other than when I can't be with her. It feels like my body is dead without her with me, and I can't wait to hold her in my arms again. We've talked and just grown closer together so much and it's been the greatest thing ever. We've talked about our future, and we are both so excited. Before her, I had no real drive to live. Now every day I wake up so happy to share a world with her. Every chance I get to talk to her is the next best second of my life. We've talked, and she told me if I were to propose today she would say yes. It's indescribable how amazing she has made me feel and how happy I've been. Nothing compares to it. She has made my life worth living to me, and I can't think of a life without her anymore. She has given me so much love and care, and it's so overwhelmingly amazing. I can't help but feel terribly unworthy of it, but I spend every day trying to feel worthy. My life genuinely has never been better and I'm so greatful. I love her so much and can't wait to spend forever with her. Thank you to anyone that read this far. I greatly appreciate it. And to anyone that feels like I did, just don't give up. Keep living the best life you can. Be yourself and never let that go. Stay strong and I'm sure you will find your person.",1
211,"Hitting a rough spot because I'm too broke to get back into the hobby/business I lovedI used to be a photographer. Shot a lot of weddings, did a lot of portraiture, was doing pretty good. I was pretty good at it. A few years ago, I was really low and getting ready to end my life. I sold all of my equipment to help pay bills. All my camera bodies, all my lenses, all my lighting, everything. I deleted all my social media accounts, deleted my photo hosting accounts and deleted my website. I've never stopped loving photography. I adore people's photos online, these lucky few who didn't sell all their shit because they lost all will to live. And I've never lost the itch to take photos. I have thousands that I've taken on my phone. Some of them are pretty good. Enough to have been printed and hung on my walls. But there's just something about having an SLR and some good glass. I miss it so much, and now that I've been doing better, I desperately want to get back into it. But to just get a basic amount of the equipment I had back, it's thousands of dollars. And it's leading me back into the negative mindset I've been successfully avoiding for a while now: ""I'll never be able to."" It's just so hard because having a hobby is a wonderful escape from depression. I think everyone should have something they do that allows them to escape everything and just *do something*. And the one hobby I'm good at and that provides me so much joy, *I can't do*. Just needed to get that out, feels better writing it than just internalizing everything. Hope you all out there are doing ok.",0

Good times don’t last forever but bad times don’t either. I remembered all the people that love me, because no matter what issues my parents have they do love me, so do my sisters and some friends that I don’t speak to anymore, but there’s people that still care. Most of all though, I realized I still care about myself and I can’t quit on me. If you’re going through something, don’t give up.

215,"HelpI don’t know where to begin or if anyone will even reply but I had some bad thoughts today and I’m ashamed of them. I’m 16 and have had depression, anxiety for 4 years now, it started off with body issues then it got worse and long story short I have a load of different small things wrong with my body that add up to make it a really big deal. I’ve been off school quite a bit because of this. Luckily enough I have a nice group of what I think of are friends, I’ll get to that in a minute. But for my whole life I’ve always been that guy who everyone thinks it’s ok to abuse me, verbally, and sometimes physically. I’ve never said it was bullying becuase everyone has only done small things to me, but they don’t know that others are doing so. At the moment people have a go at me for wearing clothes I like, being fat apparently but this is only becuase I have quite big legs. I get called an emo because I have become quite quiet over the past few years. People take the piss out of me for not being school that much. And it’s mostly my group of friends becuase the only time I talk to them is on Xbox where I can speak to them and On weekends when we go out. I get called shit at football all the time. These may not seem bad but I’m at a very big school and everyone in the years is very close with each other except for me. I’m also not allowed to like things like memes and video games. One of my “friends” always compares himself to me and says he is way better than me at everything he once said “year younger than you and I’m smarter funnier stronger faster and better at sport than you” after he said that was when I tried to kill myself for the first time. A couple of weeks ago I opened up to him about why I was missing school and told him a load of private information and things I would probably end myself if he told other people. A couple of weeks after that he compared himself to me again and said how he’s way more interesting and that nobody wants to talk to me because All I talk about is Xbox and memes. A week later from that we all went out for a meal and I was sat there and I couldn’t get into any of the conversations they had. It was like the last 8 years of my life with these people had just gone and they were different or I was different. Fast forward a week to today, we went to go watch the new Star Wars. And I had the white 2 hours 20 mins getting pop corn drinks and other hard candy thrown at me as if I was degraded, and when I said stop they would say I was just crying. After that we went to sub way and we were sitting down and I was talking to them and no matter what I said they would mock any thing that came out of my mouth. So I couldn’t take it anymore so I tried to leave but they tried to stop me and said I was just crying about it again. And that’s when I had the thought of absolutely beating the shit out of one of my friends because I couldn’t take it anymore I was done with them just disrespecting me and treating me like shit. What am I doing wrong or is it just me being soft, this has all gone on for about 3 years now, and they have slowly got more aggressive towards me. I feel like they don’t want me to be apart of the group anymore and maybe I don’t belong any more. Anyway I think I’m ready to end my life because I can’t take this shit anymore, obviously there is way more going other than issues with my fiends but this is what I’ve decided to post instead of telling strangers everything that has contributed.

216,"Please help me to get some perspective on a long term relationship that has ended but is not completely over and is causing me a huge amount of pain and anxietyMe 38/M her 38/F This is a long story and I don't know where to start or how to proceed but I'll try to highlight the important stuff and outline it as best I can. The relationship started in 2014 after we met on a dating site. The year before we met I had become addicted to opiates as a result of a snowboarding injury and by the time we started dating I was using on a daily basis. She found out not long after we started dating but made the decision to stay together despite the fact that her parents were both drug addicts and she had a very tough childhood because of it. Another thing I will mention is that her brother was murdered 11 years ago when the jealous ex boyfriend of his girlfriend came to their house and shot them both. So she's been through a lot in her life. Trust has always been an issue for her and I broke that trust many times in our relationship because of my addiction and lying to try and hide my use and as a result she thought I lied about more than drugs which was not the case but understandable. One of the biggest issues in our relationship was that she would constantly accuse me of cheating on her although I never have and in fact there were a few times that she cheated on me although she denies it was cheating because would break up and get back together (always initiated by her when my addiction would make her too upset) during the time we were together I was constantly either strung out and trying to get clean, going to rehab or clean for a few months at a time. I feel terrible about not being able to clean up my act sooner and for putting her through all the BS that goes with having a relationship with an addict. We both loved each other very much and still do although given all that's happened things were obviously very strained. I will explained what happened in the last year and a half that's led up to where things are at now since it's most pertinent to the situation. Spring of 2018 I was clean and got a great job that required me to do 3 weeks of training in another state. We were not together technically at the time but were talking frequently and she was still interested in me provided I was making progress. Upon my announcement of the job and flying to another state to do training, while I was there we decided to try to make things work and devote ourselves to the relationship. I will also mention that even when we were together and things were going as well as they could, me being clean etc. She would frequently bring up that she didn't know if we should be together and thought we should break up or that she didn't know why I loved her because we had different interests and how I should be with someone who was more like me, which I would always deny and tell her how much I loved her and that I wanted to be with her forever which was the truth but she always had doubts. How much of this was her own insecurities and the fear of being hurt again I don't know. I do know she had been cheated on in the past though. So after I finished the job training I came back and moved in with her. This lasted all of a week as she accused me of relapsing and kicked me out even though I was clean. She later apologized and acknowledged that she wish she wouldnt have done it as what happened afterwards started a big chain reaction of things getting a lot worse. We broke up and then about a month later got back together. I had agreed to take UA's for her whenever she wanted but even when I'd take a home test in front of her she'd have a hard time accepting the results because the lines weren't perfectly clear or whatever, even though the result was definitely negative for drugs. It happened again a couple weeks after we got back together and I was really upset because I had been clean and was working really hard on recovery and my job and really trying to get my life together for myself and for us. I ended up relapsing at this point because I was really sad that she refused to believe me or the drug test in front of her face. Still it was my birthday and she took me out for dinner at which point the plan was for her to pick up her daughter on her way home and drop her at a friend's and then I was going to come to her place and spend the night. Shortly after I got home from our dinner and got ready to go over there, she texts me that we're breaking up because I was using again and that this time we were done for good. I hadn't told her I had relapsed at that point but it was obvious enough for her to see even though I denied it. I completely fell apart at that point and started using really heavily. We talked for a few weeks after that and agreed to do counseling but then she ended up ghosting me which really cut me deeply and made me super anxiety ridden and heartbroken. I asked her why after she agreed to do counseling she would completely ignore me and she didnt respond. After a few weeks of this I told her I really needed to talk to her to which she agreed but then after a few days she started ignoring me again. She agreed to see me on the weekend but by midweek she stopped responding. I told her on that Friday that I was coming over after work because we needed to talk and she had agreed to see me. She told me not to come over but I was so upset and hurt by that point that I decided to go over anyways. Well when I got there the lights were out even though it was only about 9pm. She had invited her sister and sisters husband over apparently as I saw by the vehicles and not wanting to wake them if they were asleep, I knocked on the back door by her room a few times and no one answered. The her sisters husband comes out and tells me i need to leave and that she doesn't want to talk to me and I said fine whatever im leaving and as I went back to the front yard to leave the cops showed up and arrest me for criminal tresspassing. I couldnt belive it and was completely shocked and beyond hurt by that. I bailed myself out and went home but I sent her a pretty angry email in which I used a lot of bad language and said some pretty mean things to her. We had never so much as raised our voices at each other in the time we were together and I NEVER threatened her verbally or physically to any extent. Shortly after that she got a restraining order against me because according to her it was the only way she could end things permanently. I was even more hurt and heartbroken by this and I emailed her demanding an explanation. She called the cops for violating it and new at that point I had a warrant out for my arrest so after being fired from work the following weekend due to my drug use making me less than punctual and all the relationship stuff taking my focus, I left town and figured I'd just leave everything and start over somewhere else. I was super distraught over everything and was still trying to contact her via email despite the circumstances. I ended up getting her to call me after I had left town and was totally despondent and was a total wreck. She agreed to meet me at a bar for a quick talk if I came back to town. Due to the heavy use I was completely oblivious to how stupid it was of me to think that she wanted to see me and sure enough when I got to where we agreed to meet her car was nowhere to be found but about 3 seconds later I was being arrested again. The police contacted her, making me sound like an armed and dangerous criminal which freaked her out even more as they insinuated that I was somehow there to hurt her which they had no basis to do so as I again had never threatened her. I went to jail for about 3 months and was charged with a FELONY for endangering a person protected by a restraining order. This had completely screwed my life up as now that I'm in the criminal justice system with a person to person crime, I'm basically treated as a violent criminal and the same as if I had assaulted or tried to kill someone. My professional career is basically over and I was left reeling from everything that happened and still heartbroken and very distraught and desperately wanting to at least have some closure. After I got out of jail I managed to get a part time job and stayed away from her but after about 3 months we gradually started talking again and she saw that I was doing good. We didnt spend much time together as she didnt want anyone to know we were even talking much less carrying on a relationship again. This continued through last winter and into spring and even though I did end up relapsing for a short time, I cleaned up my act quickly and she didnt know because we saw each other infrequently. Fast forward to this spring, I got a full time job doing manual labor (my career was in the tech industry prior to all this) and we started talking more frequently. We decided that after the restraining order expired to start dating again and everything was going ok although we were still dealing with the unresolved issues around lack of trust, her not being able to stop accusing me of cheating despite me telling her over and over how hurtful it was. (I had tried everything I could think of to fix things by offering to let her remotely access my phone whenever she wanted, see all my calls and texts, video chat whenever she wanted so she could see I was where I said I was but she never wanted to do those things and in fact when I would press her on it and say that if she really thought I was cheating why would she stay with someone like that to which she would respond, no I guess I don't REALLY think you're cheating) Over the summer I worked really hard to rebuild my life, had a full time job and my own place for the first time since we started dating and had been clean for the better part of a year at that point. Then the worst thing imaginable in my life happened, I got injured on the job where they promptly took me to the hospital and shot me up with morphine. I had relapsed in the blink of an eye and it completely freaked me out. I was given a prescription for pain meds which I let her rip up but shortly after my trip to the hospital I started using again. She asked me if I had relapsed and for the first time in our relationship I was honest about in and started sobbing and telling her yes I had but that it's not what I wanted and I was going back to recovery and determined not to let it ruin my life again. She held me and told me she would support me and that it would be ok but immediately she started pulling away and distancing herself. She continued to treat me progressively more coldly and distantly and basically tried to get me to break up with her by seeing how much emotional abuse it would take for me to finally leave her. At this point i told her we really needed counseling ans she agreed but each time i would set up apointment, she would find a reason she couldn't make it. This upset me more than anything because I had worked so hard to finally overcome years of active addiction and show her I was truly ready to be together and put that life behind me. I did get clean again but at that point the damage had been done and she continued to distance herself alough we would still see each other on weekends when her kids weren't home. I eventually fell apart from this because I couldn't bare the thought of losing her or everything I had worked so hard for, again. I ended up missing work one morning after staying up all night trying to talk to her about things and being so upset about how things were going and ended up getting fired. I told her I couldn't deal with the reality that I had lost her, my job and with no way to pay next month's rent, my home. It hit me way hard and I completely freaked. I told her I was going to OD and I couldn't deal with life any more. I told her I needed her more than ever at that point and she needed to be there for me because I was ready to end my life. She responded by blocking my number. I ended up attempting to OD a few times over the course of a couple weeks and while we were still talking she refused to see me and always had an excuse of being too busy. I kept telling her how much I needed her support but she refused to do much outside of texting me and occasionally talking on the phone. After about a month of not seeing me at all I went to her house before she left for work one morning and I was totally despondent and told her I just needed a hug. She became super upset that I had just showed up at her house and said said something extremely hurtful asking me if I had shown up to kill her when I had asked for a hug already in tears. After that she went to work and called my probation officer telling them I showed up at her house without her consent and that she felt unsafe. They contacted me and told me to report in which I knew meant they were going to arrest me. I then contacted her again asking her why she would do that and told her I was going to OD again which I tried and was almost sucessful. I spent about a month in jail and got out in the beginning of october. I stayed clean after getting out and I was trying really hard to start over again and get my life back on track and I figured I would see if she was willing to do counseling with me at some point but about 2 weeks ago she contacted me out of the blue and told me she's in a relationship with someone and while she would do counseling to try and heal from our past and find closure, she doesnt want a relationship and wants to move on with her life. After almost 6 years of being together and all that we've been through, I am so heartbroken by her decision. I know our relationship has been filled with a lot of drama and hearbreak but we do both really love each other and she has admitted that she's in the new relationship because it's new and there's no baggage but that she still loves me and is having a hard time getting over me. I feel like we never did the right thing of getting professional help for our issues and that with counseling and my finally being over any desire to use and putting my recovery before anything else that we could finally have a chance to make things work. I believe if she saw a way to resolve things through counseling and we had a solid foundation of trust and communication she would feel the same but I am completely overwhelmed and heart broken by her decision and am having a hard time focusing on my continuing effort to heal and improve myself or anything else right now because the pain and anxiety of her dating some one else is consuming me. We're scheduled for counseling next week but I don't know how to proceed or if I should even try to fix things between us with the hope of a future together. The other thing that really complicates things is this summer she got a huge promotion and was making just under 6 figures all of a sudden after years of making just enough to get by and next year she will go to commission and be making over a half million a year. I am not a materialistic person at all but the thought of financial security is really attractive and it makes me very resentful that after so long together of dealing with both us struggling to make ends meet, we should be able to enjoy some financial improvement together and that this new guy certainly doesn't deserve to jump in and get that lifestyle with her as I'm left heartbroken and struggling to survive especially since she's contributed to making it next to impossible for me to get meaningful work. I don't feel like I'm able to let go and I'm struggling so badly with what to do and how to approach things. TLDR LTR relationship ended badly, we've agreed to do counseling but now she's dating someone else and I'm totally devastated.",0

218,"Disturbing Discussion: Suicide on Acid Experience.I’ve been extremely depressed due to some unfortunate situations happening in my life. Saturday Night I decided to end it all. I had no hope no need to live, but I always had the trouble of actually ending my life. I’ve done acid multiple times, some on higher some on lower doses, My second highest dose (600 ug) was my only bad trip. I had an outrageous fight with my girlfriend while she was tripsitting me and I truly almost committed suicide because of how shitty I felt and what my mind was thinking. Everything went dark and it truly felt like I was in Hell, I would close my eyes and I just saw the darkest places in the world. Luckily my girlfriend (bless her) understood what was happening and reassured and accessed the situation to calm me down. Forward a few months, here we are. A few days past my failed suicide. I took around 400 ug (Two Tabs) fully aware and ready to commit suicide. I thought if I could get that dark in my head I could actually do it. I went and turned my phone off around 2 hours into the trip saturday around 7 PM and the illusions started to shape itself in my life. I was in a shitty frame of mind, and I already was feeling my head start thinking some truly disturbing thoughts. I went and snuck out my house and brought an old ipod with me, including around 20 of the saddest songs i’ve ever heard. I also had 2 blades from a brand new pencil sharpener I brought prior to ensure clean and comfortable cuts. I knew where my radical artery ( correct me if i’m wrong) and another one a bit below it on my wrist. There’s a greenway in my neighborhood that’s especially spooky at night and if you continue a bridge with a huge open field, where a gang fight happened that concluded in about 10 deaths. It was ominous and scary. At the peak around 8:00 P.M I was standing on the Bridge and truly got visual hallucinations of the Gang battle that i’ve never seen before. I’ve never experienced true visual hallucinations before on Acid, it was freaking me out. With all of this in mind, I was shaking and ready to end my life. I grabbed my blade and started doing slight cuts, to get my mind moving more. With how bad I was shaking when I attempted to cut my artery which looked like a worm at the time, I couldn’t cut it I kept missing. Eventually I started to get some tingling in my right hand where i had planned it. (Not related to the Acid.) That’s when everything changed for some reason my mind went so dark and ghostly. To bright. I’m not sure what triggered in my mind because i knew I wasn’t thinking good thoughts, but i got this sudden surge of butterflies you could say. My mood and expression changed completely. I was starting to laugh and I was seeing more closing my eyes then opening them. And instead of seeing a Gang battle and blood. I was seeing this room with a unspecific personage. (I’m christian) and thought it was god himself. I came toward home actually moving and I just felt so much peace. I had an epicdemic moment. Where i just saw my life flash before my eyes. Everything good and bad. And I remembered a quote from Bob Ross (The famous artist) Saying that there needs to be bad moments in life so you can realize and notice when the good moments. I threw my blades down into the tiny river under the bridge, and just started walking home. Everything felt so surreal. I feel changed. I know i am sober atm. I feel like i have a complete different look at life and how beautiful it can be. I’m not sure if anyone else has ever experienced a trip going to bad to good without your will. Not sure if there was something in the acid either. It was the same guy i always bought from so i didn’t bother testing it. That’s my story. I’m not sure if god made that happen or what. I can tell that LSD can truly change your personality and the way you think. I was fully ready to die. and I didn’t. At this moment I feel like i have no reason to die. I was given a second chance of life, and I plan to take advantage to that. Thanks for Listening to my story. I hope everyone stays safe. Happy Tripping and Good Thoughts Ahead. <3. EDIT: It's been a while since and its crazy the amount of support and positive and informational comments and DM's I've received. I'm doing a lot better today and I appreciate you all for your words of encouragement <3",1
219,"How many times do you need to hear that you were wrong before it sinks in?How many times have we done this dance? How many times have you lost? How many times have you heard close family or friends tell you, to your face, that you were not right and you were incredibly hurtful before it actually sinks in that YOU are not right in the head? You tell lies, all the time, and when you get discovered for what you are you just cut ties and move on with telling the same lies with new people...until you get discovered where you just cut ties again and move on to newer people but still tell the same lies. And I've halted you before, on more than one occasion. And now, recently, I see it's still going on. You just moved on to new people again but still telling the same old lies, still playing the same game with no end. But I won't stop you this time, I really want to...not to hurt you or be ""petty"" as you liked to call it, but to prevent someone else from getting hurt by you. I can't protect the whole world from you, especially as it seems you are hell bent on being that victim. You were with the guy before me, and the guy before him, and the guy before him...and from what you've stated of your childhood it just seems like it's how you are. Just a sad little girl, just a sad excuse for a human. You have had family say you are toxic, you have had your ""best friend"" say you are too. And me. And the guy before me...yeah his mother was saying the same. You have to lie to get sympathy, claiming stuff that never happened...until I proved it did. And what you said. And even when you had people abandon you because of your lies and your games, still you think YOU are the victim. But you don't play victim with the people who know you, you play victim to strangers who have no idea who you are, what you have done, and not just to me but to others. Not just what you did to my kid but what you do to your own. She has practically no other family, she knows no better, she has never had the luxury of the other parent telling her that THEY are sorry for how YOU treat HER. Like seriously, you have multiple infestation going on in your place at once, and when your kid tells you the bed bugs kept her up all night attacking her feet you told her she was dirty and kept her room messy. You pretty much told her it was her fault because she isn't clean. Who in the fuck do you think you are?!!!? Your kid is unclean because you let her not shower for weeks on end, your kids room is messy because you refuse to tell her to clean up, and your place is infested because you refused to talk to your landlord so he could get it fumagated. Shouldn't surprise me though, you blamed the dog for shitting on the bathroom floor as you would keep him locked in there, lucky if he got a walk in 48 hours. It's not the dogs fault he shit on the ground when you refuse to walk him, or even get your own kid to do so. How many lives do you need to ruin, how many friends do you need to lose, how many people will it take before you can look in that mirror and see what everyone else sees, a very scared and ugly person who feels inadequate so you spend your time destroying other's lives to make you feel better about your own? Will it ever come? Is it in your mental capacity to actually GROK that? I don't think so. I truly don't, at least not on any level that you will acknowledge. Maybe when you are alone at night, longing for someone's embrace and all you find is an empty bed and people who are too busy to talk to you it sinks in, maybe for a second or two. That's it. You been playing the victim for so long I don't think you know any other way. Don't say you miss me. Just stop. You don't mean it, if you couldn't be bothered to say it when it mattered over the past few years and you can only send it into the ether for strangers to see, you don't mean it. Just like your love, but at least when it comes to love you could admit the one and only time you ever stated it to me was by accident. An accident which showed how much you intentionally would not say it even as I was ready to end it all, even as I was ready to end my life because you were saying I was wrong, I was entitled, I was crazy. Yeah...I was crazy for thinking somewhere deep inside you did care. You didn't. You still do not care about anything than yourself. Have fun playing victim to strangers again, telling your stories with no proof of anything you say. I'm not going to call you out, I'm not going to expose you for a third time. I'll let those strangers figure it out on their own. I hope they don't get too hurt by your games.",1
220,"My life is going nowhere. Ready to end my suffering.My whole life I've been punished just for being who I am. Everything started when I was going to Primary School. Everyone was bullying me for being that weird kiddo that never listened to the teachers but was self taught and knew everything. I didn't have a father when he was needed in growing up moment of my life. He was beating my mom because of alcochol and his addiction to it. Whole my life I was traveling because of my mom loans. Everything was rough no one liked me because I always was ending up as an ""outsider"" at every school. One time someone in my school almost broke my neck and he got nothing for it. I cried. I was broken down to pieces and even up to this day I feel the same. Later in my life my mom second husband was diagnosed with brain tumor and died on my and my mom eyes. I never liked him but I knew that my mom is loving him so that's why I tried to be his good frend. After everything she was so down that she became an alcoholic like my father. She started to be prostitute right in front of my eyes. I didn't have enyone to help me with my pain. I started to learn programming and that was like medicine. I wasn't thinking about anything. Few years later I got my first job as frontend developer and hell continued. My boss was telling me that I was smelling bad and I wasn't taking good care of myself because of that. I was starting to get depression and commited suicide. My mom rescued me freezing to death on bench poisoned with alcochol. I've meet a girl that wanted to change everything. She helped me a lot. And then she started to do bad things. She talked with my friend at the time about sex and that she was ready to cheat on me. I was begging her to stay and help me. I was crying every night because she was hurting me in multiple ways. I wanted the best for her. I was taking loans on holidays just to feel good. I helped her with finding job and wanted to live with her. I wanted to get going with my life not standing still. Now I have really good salary at my job but people who was there at the time left me unfinished jobs and I need to work 18h a day to fix this mess. I'm not happy with my life and I'm feeling empty. My life was a fucking mess and still is. Now I don't feel anything. I'm ready to jump of the my fathers apartement like friend of mine did. I hate my life.",1
221,"Mental Health In 2019 As the year finishes I wanted to talk about my mental health this year. It is my 3rd year of server issues. Beginning was my sophomore year of hs, and it was not good. I joined sports med and the people were... toxic per say. Rude to me for no reason, putting everything one me -the only new one- and kicking back while calling me lazy. My best friend of 12 years got a bf, I was happy until she started pushing me away. I stopped eating and was ready to end my life. March 9th was a hard day, the day my GG (great grandma) died 3 years and it was hard. I got close with another girl, and she helped me so much. The sports med people all left the program and we got a new trainer who is amazing and I was the only one left from the pervious year. She asked me to help her build the program. So I did. All summer I helped with the cleaning and supplies and even with the ‘interview’ to get people in. My mental health was getting better. Junior year came along and my one friend and I stopped talking besides the one class we have together and only do little. My new friend and I are so close her mom calls me daughter and I have my own bed and spare cloths. She surprised me for my 16th birthday I got my license. Sports med is great. The people are great. There are two girls I don’t really want to put myself around but I grew close with one girl who graduated next year and I’ll miss her. I fell in love with football and it just ended which is sad. My school is city and CIF champs of our section. We have a 13-2 score when we had 0-10 my freshman. I love the guys and sad to see the seniors go. My mental health is great right now. I’m happy. Just know it gets better. I almost killed myself this year and now I can’t even think of that. I may only have two close friends but I love them more than anything. I love sports med. I love school. I love life. For the first time in 4 years.",0
222,"Which is worse, fybrin glue on the nerves or 3rd and 4th degree burns?Hello fellow leakers, I just finished my second round of patches and the last one included a fybrin glue patch. A very morbid part of me has been wondering if I've finally topped out on the pain scale. Up until that second round with the fybrin glue, no doctor had ever managed to make me cry in pain. I have always been able to stay still and composed when it comes to physical pain. My point being, I don't think I'm wimpy. Most people are surprised at how much I tolerate before I show the pain. The only experience I have had that hurt more than the fybrin glue was having meningitis. I was chewing my arm bad-I was mad with pain and ready to end my life should that be my only escape. I have never had 3rd or 4th degree burns, but my extensive experience with accidentally burning myself while cooking is that burns hurt a fuck ton more than you'd think for the size of the sear. So now I turn to reddit, has anyone had the ""opportunity"" to compare them?",0
223,"Visualization - How to beat porn - what will quitting porn do for you?First, let me introduce myself. I’ve been involved in NoFap since 2015. At the time, I was suffering from depression, suicidal thoughts and a huge lack of motivation. I was ready to end my life, despite living with a beautiful partner. Then, one night when I typed in the P word into google, it suggested Your Brain On Porn. That’s when google was actually helpful. I watched and rewatched the Great porn experiment over and over again, because my life was starting to make sense. I was really depleting myself through porn on a dopamine hamster wheel, the more depressed I got the more porn, the more porn the more depressed. Then I started to realize what I needed to do, and it really has come right into focus now. Many of us fail, many of us relapse - and I believe it is an issue with our imaginations. Essentially, porn lives in our imaginations - we see the attractive people in our minds and desire them. We may or may not drilling down to payment for premium services because we can’t get it out of our minds. So, if a huge chunk of our issues is our imaginations, can’t we turn that around. Why don’t we think about the benefits of removing porn out of our lives. More time to study, work hard - to achieve worthy goals. More time to work out. More focus. Better memory. And if were drilling down to pay for premium services, cancelling all of that and saving more money and getting out of debt (lets face it, with 500k people here, there’s probably 1000s who have lots of debt due to porn). So, lets talk about how getting rid of porn will improve our lives! Science says, if we visualize something for 30 seconds a day, you will actually achieve all you visualize - and visualizing also includes how you will feel about it. How would you feel about all the things I just described above. Pretty damn proud, I would think. So, let me go first. 1. By getting rid of porn, I can start to get my debt under control, because I did drill down to get vids under paywalls. 2. I get to really work on my tabletop RPG game, Tales from Trinity City - which I am almost done. 3. I have more time in the morning to improve my life by reading more, meditating more. 4. Spending much more time with my beautiful partner. And that makes me feel very happy. And when I feel like watching porn when I can’t fall asleep at night, I can always pet the family dog, who almost always sleeps by me - it’s so awesome.",0

226,"Need advice. From suicide to happiness in one day.Hi guys, so today when I woke up I was ready to end my life because I was just to afraid of having a miserable future filled with regret. I don't think I'm an attractive person and I dont think a person would ever want to be with me for any period of time. Being alone a lot I ended up reading some comments of people trying to talk this guy out of it and I read something that really made me appreciate the path I have with my passion and the possibilities. I spent the rest of the day studying and went to the gym right after, left out feeling great but on the way back everything feel apart again... On the way back I ended up meeting with some people I used to know, one of them was a girl that I pushed away because I didn't think I was good enough at the beggining but after just felt better being by myself and focusing on my passion. I'm not much of a usual man, I hate the idea of masculity and think it's pretty stupid and archaic but I suffered from severe social anxiety for a while now and she is well aware of that so I just assumed that any chance of us having something was destroyed and that me even thinking about it so much was very pathetic because she saw how vulnerable of a person I am and that I'm not much of a dating material. We talked and she actually made a joke about me not socializing with other people that much and asked why I stoped texting her and that she felt sad about it. I was awkward, insecure and barely talked. Once she left I talked to much and got home feeling like absolute trash. She texted me, we talked a bit and then she left.in my mind she thinks I'm not interested or that I'm just too much of a coward. Here's the thing guys, everytime I try to do these things I end up having to deal with the snowball that becomes my mind so I usually just stay alone and accept that it is the sacrifice I have to make on my path to not be miserable. I do not want to be alone for the rest of my life So I am also taken by fear when I stay alone too long these days, I think of having a girl and I imagine myself showing my favourite movies to her and just filling her with love and attention. So what it comes to me is that i am throwing this chance away and that I will become old, alone and regretful as I said before, probably killing myself on the same period. Should I go out with her even if it can be detrimental for my mental health? Am I ready for this? Do I not want to be with her or am I just forcing it because of the fear? I stay alone a lot these days because people here just don't get me so i end up acting differently than i am. I'm moving to Spain next year so I presume loneliness will be a big part of my life as well. I stay alone a lot and consider myself to be pretty inteligent with things that interest me. I study and take notes all day. I just look at her and I can't imagine how she can like me sexually or in an emotional way after being such a mess of a person and so ugly. I mean I went to reddit and wrote a text because of a bus encounter. I do not want to be just friends with her so if I cannot do that then what the hell am I doing. A little backstory: The last two years of my life were me alone so focused on my passion and not really wanting to do anything else. This girl apparently tought I was handsome and asked my number from a friend and once we went out to his house to talk I was pretty nervous and they tickled each other in front of me witch was very unconfrotable. Here's the thing guys, I actually don't consider myself a very anxious person when it comes to relationships, it's just that these people here and their culture just doesn't click well with me at all (since I grew up alone and discovering things on the internet.) We went out one time and it was actually pretty great, I was thinking I looked ugly the hole time while talking but it was still really fun. So here I seat, alone in my room instead of studying wondering if I should do this and wasting brain space on this person that might not even like me that way. I don't know if I want this and I dont know if I should do this regardless. I would if reaching out wasn't such a challenge when trying to maintain a stable mental health and focus on your passion. I want to be better, the person I know I am and I dont know if this is a step back or forward.",1
227,"I have been complaining about my mental health for over 5 years to anyone who can help, but they all refuse to listen. They see me as too perfect to even hear me out. This is really just an r/offmychest. [RANT]I don't really expect anyone to read this. I'm writing this to get it off my chest. If you do choose to read, lmk if you've ever had a similar situation with family members and doctors and friends. This is mostly for my own sanity, though. PS sorry for bad grammar and spelling, I'm on mobile. ___________________ I'm going to keep pushing forward. I am not quite to the point of suicide yet, but I am afraid that I won't be able to go on my entire life like this. 80+ years like this? That bums me out just thinking about it. the tldr of this is that I never feel alive. Im always zoned out, in a daze and brainfog. I can't focus, and I live my life seeking stimulation, instead of things that make me actually happy. I'm neither happy nor sad. I haven't truly experienced either in a long time. I will be able to pull through a few more years though. Since I'm not especially sad, and I fear death more than anything else, it'll be a while before it comes to that. But I fear that will eventually be the end of me. Some important information about me. I do really well in school (a+'s all over the place, even in AP classes) and well on the in person AP exams (I've passed AP computer science exam, AP calculus AB exam, and AP us history exam) and did decent on my SAT (1390/1600 which is considered average among people going to college, and well above average for all high schoolers. I did especially well on the math, with a 740/800. That's impressive because I have dyscalculia, meaning I can't tell you what 7 + 5 is off the top of my head. Added some difficulty on the no calculator section, as you can imagine). Oh, and I got a perfect 100% score on the California standardized testing, which includes math and English and some science. I am a 17yr old male, going into 12 grade in a week or two. I attend school online, because the in person school that I was attending was really screwing me up l mentally. I left the school with a very strong case of dyscalculia. Fortunately, ever since I've left in person school, I've been able to learn coping mechanisms for dyscalculia (although I don't think I will be curing myself anytime soon), heal, and learn everything from algebra to calculus correctly. I'm glad I got away from that shit, I can't even begin to imagine how fucked up I would be if I stayed any longer. Anyways, that's just a little backstory. Something that has been concerning me for the last 5 or so years has been a slow cognitive decline. I know that, typically, people have ADHD their entire life. In my case, I've only really taken notice the past 5 years. I've noticed, however, that it seems to be getting worse. Maybe it's an illusion though, caused by the fact that I don't renember my younger years well. Here are my problems: - I miss a great deal of information that comes my way. My memory isn't great, but even worse than my memory is paying attention to and processing the information to begin with. Your name? Where you're from? What you enjoy doing? It's in one ear and out the other. I almost never remember a person's name the first time around. It takes a few goes before I get it. - Understanding what you're saying. What you're saying sounds to me like a TV on 5% volume, playing in the background, while I'm slowly falling asleep. I truly care about what people have to say, but keeping up mentally is a terrible experience. I feel so inattentive to people at all times. And, oftentimes, I'm concerned about what I'm going to say next (social anxiety does that to people- I HAVE to plan what I say before I say it.) Im not slow or anything, as evidenced by my decent test scores and whatnot, but I can't focus and apply myself when communicating with people. - almost nothing gives me the mental stimulation I need. Video games, which are supposed to be one of the best mental stimulators available, don't do shit for me. I zone out almost immediately, and it just isn't an enjoyable experience. I can only really force myself to play a game like CSGO for maybe 30 minutes at a time. I then proceed to get bored. The only thing that seems to work for me is running. I've found myself getting absolutely addicted to running. I easily spend 1-3 hours running, and i absolutely would go longer if it wasn't for hip pain. This makes sense- exercise boosts serotonin and dopamine levels, the latter of which is an important function of ADHD medication. I do this despite the enormous pain and physical discomfort. It seriously puts my mind at ease. But nothing else works. I've experimented with both none and a ton of coffee before, neither of which seem to have any effect. Running is the only thi g I know of that makes my brain feel correct. - I can't finish projects if they take any longer than about 2-3 days. I lose enthusiasm so quickly. Which is unfortunate, because I always start off with an insane amount of energy. Everyone around me knows just how energetic I can be. But they don't really know that I never have enough in the end. - Worst of all, I feel like a walking zombie. I don't really feel much anymore. I'm always indifferent and melancholy inside. I act happy for those around me, but I personally always feel ""meh"". I'm always dazed and zoned out in a miserable brain fog- except for when I run. This is the one thing that I hate most. I don't remember feeling this way when I was younger, but maybe I just forgot about my younger self, idk. I can't even call myself depressed per se, because I never feel deep sorrow, either. My emotion and consciousness is simply drained out of me, and video games or other activities don't usually snap me out of this. I haven't felt alive for a long, long time, aside for whenever I run. So I guess the point of this post is just to get this stuff off my chest. I don't expect anyone to reply. The thing that really gets me is that I have never met anyone who understands what I'm going through with this damn brain fog and frustrating lack of focus, and my insatiable desire for mental stimulation. Because of my grades and scores, no one will believe me when I tell them that I can't focus. I can't even read things that interest me for more than a couple of seconds without zoning out (which I find especially insane). Getting through my reading for school is hell, because I have to reread everything at least 3 times before I read it without zoning out. I can clearly tell that my mother has ADHD herself, but she doesn't quite believe it when I tell her this. it's an endless cycle of her telling me that this and that are normal, since life with ADHd is all she's ever known. My father doesn't have ADHD, but when I tell him about it, he is in denial. He thinks of me as a perfect person. He's not in denial when talking about my brother, however, who's been actually diagnosed with ADHd by a psychiatrist. Doesn't matter anyways though, I don't see my dad very often. And if I don't want to burst his bubble ig. They will not take me to a psychiatrist because my grades are good (the only reason why my grades are good is because I spend 12+ hours on school dialy). They think I'm just tired when I can hardly understand what's going on, what they are saying, what we are doing, etc. I can't focus anymore, and I feel completely zoned out all the time. I told my doctor last time I did a checkup, he told me it was no big deal, that I should meditate, keep an eye on my diet, etc, all of which I have tried. My parents aren't abusive. They just don't want to believe that their ""awesome"" kid with good grades can be so fucked up. They took my brother to a psychiatrist to deal with his ADHD, and my parents are understanding of my sister's depression and GAD. As for me, well, I must be perfect. I am the youngest, btw, and my other two siblings are now off to coege. I don't k ow if what I described is ADHD or something else. But I need mental help at this point, to find out what the fuck is wrong with me. I know something is wrong. I am not malnourished, I am not dehydrated, I have sufficient vitamins, I eat a proper amount every day, etc. Put simply, the few people who are capable of helping me refuse to do so. Since I'm not ready to end my life yet, there is literally no way out of this, and I just have to endure. Hopefully getting this off my chest helps. PS you're amazing if you read this entire rant lmao!",1
228,"My success story. (Trigger warning)I don’t think anyone is going to read this since it is going to be long, but I find it therapeutic to share my experience. When I was in 7th grade I was dating a guy. We were constantly breaking up and getting back together. I knew he was a bad person, yet he would convince me to give him another chance. It was like this for 2 years. At the beginning, he started judging me. And then he started verbally abusing me. He told me everything I did wrong and made me feel so weird for normal things. He started controlling who I hung out with, and who I got close with. He started stealing my lunch and eating it in front of me, saying I could lose a couple of pounds. This lead me to be briefly anorexic. He started physically abusing me. It was small at first, like just grabbing me too tight. Then it turned into shoving. He did it at school too. I knew this behavior wasn’t right. But he was my first boyfriend and it didn’t know how truly horrible he was. It was a cycle: I’d break up with him, he’d get me back and be an amazing boyfriend for a couple of weeks, and then he would start to be horrible again. The summer before high school is when things escalated. He started leaving more bruises on my body. At that point it was just from grabbing me too hard. It became a running joke in my school that I had high pain tolerance because I was dating him. The first time we had sex I was 14 and it was consensual. It was both of our first times. But it was like it woke a demon inside him. He wanted more than I could give and that’s when he started forcing me. I only really remember the first and last time. The first time it was a blow job. I was so confused as to why he was making me do it and I was crying the whole time. I though if I cried he would stop, but he didn’t. Months past of this and I can’t remember anything but I know stuff happened. The last time was the worst. My little brother who is a year younger than me but has Down syndrome was in the room. He started raping me and at this point, I just laid there and tried not to think about what was happening. My little brother noticed something was wrong and pulled my boyfriend off of me saying “get off my sister”. Something inside of me snapped. I told a friend and he told me that it was rape. I was confused because I didn’t think boyfriends could rape girlfriends. I thought that was just a “man lurking in the bushes” sort of deal. I broke up with him but my life only got worse. He stalked me almost all of high school. He followed me to my classes while harassing me. He punched me in front of my friends. He would threaten me. He blackmailed me constantly. He sent me videos of him taking a bunch of pills trying to kill himself because of what I thought about him, but when I showed my dad the video he zoomed it on the pills. They were Advil. He sent me a video of him taking 10 Advil. He vandalized my art that was put out into the hallway and would try any excuse to be around me. I got a school restraining order but it only protected me by 10 feet. And since I couldn’t prove anything, it worked both ways. So he would constantly go to the school to tell them I’m spreading rumors and breaking contract. It’s been 7 years since then and I would be lying if I said this doesn’t still affect me. Sometimes I get angry or depressed, but I just started going to therapy and I love it. I feel like I am feeling a million things at once when I think about the whole situation. But right now I feel proud. Because I got through that without a ton of support from anyone else. My abuser barely graduated high school and I am one year away from getting my degree. I am truly happy now. I have a cat that I adore more than most people and I have a boyfriend that loves me, respects me, and values me. I have an awesome job that I am proud of and cute new apartment. From 2012-2017 I was ready to end my life, but now I am thriving. It gets better. It really really does.",1

230,"Suicide PostponementAfter careful consideration, I found myself almost ready to end my life I had made nearly all necessary preparations from drafting my suicide notes to procuring the means to end my life painlessly.

After hanging out with her and a few new friends at university, I decided that I would give life a try. I shall put off killing myself. I will enjoy my life for now. I will spend time with me new friends and my brother and sister. I will finish this semester of university and maybe the next one. In fact, I might refrain from committing suicide altogether.

231,"Finally getting into inpatient detox - I'm ready to end this period of my life (warning, long post incoming).Hey guys, I've been drinking heavily for about 4 years now, with it getting progressively worse over time. Currently I drink 1-2 Steelies/Nattys during the day and another 12-18 beers a night, or 750ml+ of vodka. I'm 140 lb so it's pretty hard on my body. I lost my job (actually not due to my drinking, surprisingly but that's a whole 'nother issue that pisses me off) and since then have been living with family. My grandparents need full time care so I've been supporting my habit by doing housework, cooking, yard work etc in exchange for cash. I feel like I can't rejoin the real workforce due to my drinking issues. I've had a chemical dependency evaluation in the past because I wanted to see a therapist/psychologist since I believe I have some long time undiagnosed mental illness, but obviously they wouldn't admit me to a program unless I went through a rehab program first. My consular was a total bitch and seemed entirely disinterested in me and/or her job. That turned me off from the program and I continued with my crippling alcoholism. Finally, this week I decided enough was enough. I'm sick of living like this and went back for another evaluation. This time the consular was a wonderful woman who seems to genuinely want to help me. I've been put on an ""urgent"" list and will have a bed within two weeks to detox. Until then I am trying to maintain to avoid withdrawals but not get drunk every night. I'm done with this period of my life and ready to move on.",1
232,"Well guys, I sincerely need karma.There will be mentions of rape in this thread, so please be aware before continuing this post. . . . I’m a 26yo female from TX. I work night shift as pest control and I’ve done somewhat decent for myself lately, considering the abandonment from my mother, and complete disconnect from my father. I have no siblings, and I’m not extremely close to any of my cousins/aunts/uncles considering they live stares away. Anyway, my position at work is 5pm-5am, so basically graveyard. One night, when I was getting off of work (I work in a very rural area, there are some homes nearby, but it’s mainly a wooded area). As I was leaving the office (I’m always the last to leave) I was sexually assaulted (raped). It was the most horrifying thing to ever occur in my life. I still feel absolutely disgusting, degraded, and like I’m not worth a singe fuck. In my early teen years I was a pot head, and from the PTSD of being abandoned by both parents, I was suicidal and a self harmer. Since the age of 18, I’ve slowed way down on self harm, but now, my world has come crashing down. Since I was raped, I’ve been extremely withdrawn, lost my job, and I’m pretty much fucked. I missed my period and fucking guess what, I’m pregnant. I do not want this baby, and I can not afford an abortion (with assistance from some organizations it still boils down to 348$, that I do not have. I’m so beyond ready to end my life. Guys, please, I need a friend at this point. Mentally I can NOT handle this. This is the absolute worst thing that could’ve ever happened and idk if I can survive this if I don’t get that abortion. I’m contemplating on trying at home methods, but I’m honestly scared. Any advice/tips/ anything? Please . The only friend I had suggested I post here, as the people here are usually non judgmental, and very supportive. I honestly don’t know what to do or where to turn. Please.Help.Me ((Edited to add: I’ve got 85$ to put toward the abortion, but the issue is, if I don’t make it to my non-surgical appointment tomorrow for the abortion, I can’t have it done legally as I’d be over the legal timeframe to do so )) and I really need to post in r/borrow or r/assistance to hopefully get funded for the procedure by the morning",1
233,"I need help, but I'm too scared to get it Throwaway so this doesn't bite me in the ass. I hate my life. I can never find any drive to do anything, I've stopped caring about hygeiene or appearance, I can't sleep without getting paranoid and scared, leading me to become sleep deprived, I have to sleep with a light on, which still doesn't work at all, I can't even go anything outside my bed when it's dark, I'm angry at everything, and I want to die. Those are just some of my issues. The truth is, I really don't want to die. Thinking about suicide just makes me tear up. I have a whole future ahead of me, and I don't want to lose it. I want to live my life, be in a relationship, and see the world. I'm not ready to end my life. Yet my mind is constantly pushing me to do it, to harm myself, and even hurt my family when things really get dark. I want help so bad. I want to talk to a professional, I want to feel better about myself, and finally shut the part of me that wants to hurt up. Yet I'm too scared too. I don't know if my family will ever believe me, or just tease me even more. I also feel like the only way I could ever get help, is if I try to kill myself. I hate feeling like this, and I just want professional help. I'm so confused and scared of myself and my future now. TL;DR: I have severe issues, and I'm too scared to find help for them.",1
234,"My abortion saved me from my domestic abuser.I already had one child and was being beaten on a daily basis. When I tried to leave I was stalked and beaten to the point where I almost died. I tried to leave so many times, everyone had abandoned me, I was homeless (meaning staying with him was my literal only option) and I was using opiates to cope with the pain of daily punches and kicks to my head. I had nowhere to go and no to help me. No car, shitty job, and me and my infant were trapped with her father. When I went to get my abortion I was terrified. It was a surgical abortion so they medicated me, and when I came out of it immediately after the procedure, I laughed and smiled and was giddy that I wasn't bringing another child into this MESS. I promised myself I would get out of his house. I started saving money and looking for better jobs and got into a medically assisted recovery program, but it wasn't enough to change my entire life. My husband caught wind of the birth control I was taking and sabotaged me, knowing I was planning on leaving. He found the $1000 I had FINALLY saved up and he stole it from me, and then pretended he knew nothing about it. I was ready to end my life. I couldnt take it any more but I knew if I died he would have my daughter alone for the rest of her life, neglected and eventually abused like me. So I stayed. I started gaining weight and I couldnt figure out why. I regularly went 6 months without a period due to stress, and other than weight gain I had no other symptoms. Turns out, by the time my husband allowed me to use the car for a doctors appointment, I was 18 WEEKS PREGNANT. I tried to ask my doctor if it was still possible to end the pregnancy, and made me feel like a piece of garbage for even asking. When I tried to look online, all I could find were horror articles about ""late term abortion"" and my depression was the worst it had ever been. I called my mother, who I was not close with, and begged her to come get me and my daughter, and to hide me away for a while so I could get my shit together. &#x200B; Because of the delayed prenatal care and the punch to the stomach, while I was 24 weeks pregnant, my second daughter was born deaf and disabled. Now, I have two children. I have a good job and make a middle-class salary. I have a house where JUST ME and my two girls live (no boyfriends allowed), and I kill myself working to support my girls because . my e-husband refuses to pay child support and anytime I try to bring him to court he just quits his job. His girlfriend supports him and they live in her mother's basement. My children are safe, well fed, clean and happy and that is all I could have ever asked for. It has been hard, lonely, stressful, and I wish I had better medical care during my pregnancies. I could have left him so much sooner, I could have stopped all the brain trauma and bodily injury, I could have given my first daughter so much more in life if I had had access to REAL woman-focused medical care. I don't regret a thing and my second daughter is AMAZING. But I do wonder where my life would be if I had actual choices in what happened to my body. I had dreams once. Now I have kids, and my only dream is that I don't fuck them up and that I keep them safe. &#x200B; Don't take for granted your safety and bodily autonomy. It can be taken away so easily.",1
235,"no hormones?i posted about detransing in here before, but while i was on T, it freaked my uterus out and caused pain so bad i could not even lay down comfortably and was unable to stand and walk. i had a hysterectomy because of that and back then i thought i would be on T for the rest of my life and didn't think i would follow through with detransing. well obviously the worst came to worst and it happened. but due to no longer having needles and syringes i have been off hormones for 3 weeks now. my endo does not have an available opening until the 17th of july. i am essentially on no hormones and then had to choose between T and E as my body no longer produces any hormones. pros and cons, E is obviously the best and so i am 100% detransing. but... i need hormones in my body to function. i have a month supply of T left. no E. i will call my primary doctor to see if she can help but... has anyone else been in this situation? i honestly have no clue what to do right now. i decided to stop T but now i might need to continue it for a month? at this point i am ready to end my life and make sure it works this time, too. it's just a goddamn mess. UPDATE: my mom is a nurse and said my primary doctor should be able to and she can normally get me in relatively quickly especially for something like this. so everything should be okay now i am hoping! UPDATE: my primary doctor is not able to for some reason. my endo cannot get me in until the 17th. it's been 3 weeks since i took T; will i be okay without hormones for 5 more weeks?",1
236,"Help, I'm starting to feel like we'll never escape (TW: suicidal ideation)I'm 25, my sibling is 20. 3 weeks ago or so my Nmom's outburst was so bad, I'd been fighting for so long & my health is falling apart... I literally started sobbing while locking up my bike next to work. I decided I was ready to end my life, I just wanted to let her win. Thankfully, my coworkers not only let me take the day off but also spent the day with me making sure I was safe. I decided the next day I had to move out or that's it, I'm ending it. I explained the situation to a few people I trust, all have been sweet & offered to help us. I've looked at several apartments & finally found a few I thought we could afford. We both make a bit above minimum wage, but now they are asking us both for formal rental history. We rent from nMom currently, paying to live under her roof with her as our roommate. I tried to explain the situation to the prospective places. My sibling has never even been able to live on their own & can barely leave the house for work because of their ptsd from the abuse. I have very little rental history from before I was manipulated into moving back in with nmom. This seems insurmountable & I wonder if anyone has any advice. One of the places told me to reach out to the ywca but they just said all their lawyers were busy?? I'm really clueless. I should add that we both have been saving for other things we needed, so the financial aspect is tight but we could make it for sure. The problem is no one wants to rent to us without formal rental history.",1
237,"Sober life hasn’t been so great Last summer I was using and I overdosed, it wasn’t intentional but I also wasn’t against the idea of dying. I remember turning on some Alice in chains and just nodding into blissful ness it was the best I’ve ever felt in my life until I woke up with a shit ton of paramedics surrounding me on my bedroom floor apparently my buddy (my only friend) tried to come over and I was greyish/blue and he called them. I wasn’t very grateful for him saving my life and that burns me inside to this day I never got to thank him as he died of an overdose 3 days later when I was at work I felt and still do feel extremely guilty for everything. My immediate response was I wanted to kill myself and I actually tried that time but some girl I was with at the time found me called the ambulance and flushed my entire stash. I woke up in the hospital with her and my family surrounding me it was the worst feeling of my life putting them threw this, the girl had never been around drugs and she almost watched me die. my family was constantly doing check ups after that n the reason I opted out of killing myself was my mom. I didn’t wanna put her threw that so I attempted a sober life. But sober life is just painful it’s almost been a year and it’s nothing but suffering I lost my job cuz of the incident, no one will hire me, everyone looks at me different now and all I ever think about is how much I wanna die as soon as I open my eyes in the morning it’s my first thought. All the reasons to stay alive are now gone so I’m ready to end my life or the very least the sobriety. I don’t wanna go on living like this but I just don’t know what to do anymore.",1
238,I just lost my job this morning and i'm very ready to end it all. Life is just going to get worse until the day i die. I need to vent out my emotions so please hear me out. There is still a small part of me that wants to live.I'm not sure what I should expect from this subreddit but just wanted to vent anyways. I've had issues with depression and suicidal thoughts for most of my life. Seriously thinking about drowning myself in the ocean so that my body will never be found. My former manager expressed concern several times over the last year or so that my interactions with my colleagues were concerning. Most people thought i was disrespectful towards them and wondered that I should be less negative towards them. I barely tried to turn things around unfortunately because I'm so stubborn. But maybe it was a bandaid to a lifelong problem with depression. I have many issues to sort out if I'm not going to eventually kill myself. I'm feeling very overwhelmed by it all and it's all my fault and no one will care if I just disappear. Sorry if my post breaks any of the rules on this subreddit I'm just trying to keep it together.,1

I really didn’t think I’d make it to that day. A year ago, all I could imagine was my family either celebrating or grieving a year without me. Exactly a year ago on the 9th, my then 18th birthday, my then partner and I messed up in the worst of ways that eventually led to our breakup on the 23rd of December. I don’t hate them despite what they did to me and I did to them. Because of them, I am still alive to this day. They are the reason I didn’t end it last year, even if I do believe they manipulated me into not ending my life as they’ve admitted to manipulating me before. Exactly a week ago today, I felt loved and appreciated in a way I haven’t felt since I was just a little girl. I cried at 3am on my birthday not because I hate myself and I don’t want to live anymore. I cried at 3am on my birthday because, finally, for the first time in nine years, I was happy to be alive. I’m still lost, I think I messed up my life and there’s no way I can get it back, but I’m happy to be alive still. I’m glad I didn’t end my life a year ago. I still don’t believe it’ll get better for me, but honestly I couldn’t care less. I’m okay despite all that happened and what let me to where I am now. I don’t care if there isn’t any hope for me anymore, that’s fine as I have accepted I won’t be anything great. As long as I have my amazing friends and family, I’m fine.

244,"My [20M] boyfriend [22M] is going to be hospitalized for suicidal thoughts later today. I was planning on breaking up with him this week, but he doesn't know. What do I do? .We have been together for 3 years in a wonderful, loving relationship but after much trying I do not wish to continue. As title says I was going to break up with him this week, and he had no idea. He has a history of depression (was previously hospitalized) and texted me today that he wrote a note yesterday and was planning to attempt today, but that he is instead going to check himself into a psych hospital after he gets off work, and that he needs my support again. I have always been his rock and he has been mine. Many times I have been the reason he hasn't killed himself, according to him My central issue is that I don't know if I should break up with him while in the hospital so I know he's 100% safe and can receive care; or if I should not upset him during this time and wait until he's out. If he wanted, I would still provide support and visitation because I'm still his best friend. But I don't want to drop the bomb like that while he's already having a terrible time . But I'm not going to be in a relationship i don't want, for however many months it takes for him to recover. However, if I were to break up with him when he got out, I'd afraid he'd attempt or get worse. So i'm not sure what to do. Please don't think of this as me being an asshole, please do not come to bully me. I love and care for the safety and wellbeing of this man more than anything in the world. He's my best friend. I want to make sure that he's safe but I don't know what to do. Please help me. I need advice. Thank you for reading.",0

I thought it would be super low key because casual conversation lmao. I can’t say enough thank yous for the kindness. ALSO just thought I’d clarify what occupational therapy is and what we do! OT is a health profession and we work with people of all ages, with all sorts of physical and mental disabilities, to be able to engage in the activities that they want to do, need to do, or are expected to do. For example, a school-based OT might help a child with autism to participate successfully in classroom activities, and an OT in physical rehabilitation might help someone with paralysis to learn how to get dressed without the function of their legs (etc). OP: Since then, I finished high school, undergrad, grad school, and my boards. Also I found some new passions, adopted a dog, and fell in love NBD. I’m usually not sappy but I’m allowing this of myself today LOL What’s something you’ve achieved that you never in a million years thought you could do?",0

258,"I (33M) asked wife (35F) for divorce and she turned suicidalI (33M) asked me wife (35F) for a divorce. A lot of build up to that the prior few weeks. She lost it emotionally and turned suicidal. I really need advice on what to do. (BTW, this is a throwaway acct since I have a lot of family on Reddit.) To make a long story as short as possible; I live with my in-laws w/ my wife and two pre-teen girls. It's been this way for a three years now. I drive to work an hour and fifteen minutes each way, for a total of 2.5 hours of driving each day... 4 days a week. My job lets me work from home (the in-laws house) on Friday's. We had an opportunity a few months back to move into a new house. My Uncle / Owner of the place I work bought it for rental property, but decided to offer it to us as a rent to own deal. He offered it to me with a bonus of $1000 per month towards the mortgage, so we literally could be living in a new home for like $400 per month not including utilities. Also, it was only 15 minutes away from work. Sounded like an amazing offer to me, but not to my wife. She refused to move since it was an hour away from her family, and didn't want to move the kids from their school. My Uncle gave me a deadline on when he needed to know by, and I couldn't pull the trigger on it, so I lost out. My wife and my mother-in-law were completely against it and I didn't know what to do. Fast forward to now; we've been fighting a lot and it literally feels like I'm living with a roommate. I told her last weekend I wanted a divorce. She lost it. She bawled and screamed at me. She grabbed her keys took off while crying. Over the next hour she texted me suicidal texts on how I ""better give the girls a great life because she's not going to be around anymore"". She said she ""wouldn't go through a divorce again"".(she was previously divorced). I told her to stop talking like that and that we should focus on the girls now and co-parenting the best we can... and that it would damage the girls so badly if she went through with it. She then texts me ""goodbye, you'll never see me again"". I called her, but her phone is off. I leave the house and call the suicide hotline while driving around looking for her. Wow, were they so kind! I actually was crying on the phone telling her the situation. The woman on the phone (suicide hotline) told me to call the police if I couldn't find her soon. I go to a place I think she might be and they tell me she just left the house and is going shopping with her grandparents. WTF, why is she acting like she's going to commit suicide when she's out with her grandparents. She comes back home and later that night she's begging me to stay. My mind was so made up before all this but now I'm so unsure, because I fear for her safety. The next day the texts are rolling in while I was at work saying she will do ANYTHING if I stay. At this point, I don't want to stay but my heart breaks that someone cares so deeply for someone and that individual is going to abandon them. Also, this isn't the first time I've tried to leave over the past 10 years of marriage. She always went down the whole ""nobody loves me, and everyone wants to hurt me"". (Her previous husband was physically and mentally abusive). I've asked her to get help, but she refuses. So I would stay and our relationship would improve, but be back to terrible within a couple months at most. Please Reddit fam, help me out. TL;DR: Long time coming, asked wife for divorce and she left the house crying and saying she'll commit suicide. Now, is begging me to stay and claims willing to do anything for me. I was set on leaving, but now I'm torn on where to go from here.",0

263,"Thoughts on the finale, from a formerly suicidal person [Possible Triggers]I've seen a lot of people these past few days upset and concerned that the Door, and the Good Place, is advocating suicide. I thought I'd throw my two cents in as someone who has actually attempted to kill myself and still struggles with suicidal thoughts from time to time. (I'm in therapy now and well-medicated, don't worry.) **Suicide is a violent act. There is no such thing as a peaceful suicide**. Suicide is far, far more than ""Person kills themself"". To reduce it to those terms is a disservice. All suicides leave a corpse. Most suicides in the United States either involve guns or drugs, so there is not only a corpse but blood and guts and vomit. It traumatizes those left behind. Suicide is horrible. I cannot say I disagree with attempted suicide being considered a crime, because I saw my wife and family's faces when I woke at the hospital. I hurt them, far more than if I had done a traditional crime in their presence. Suicide makes victims out of individuals and those that love them. It is a gut-wrenching, *entirely preventable* conclusion. **The Good Place Door, on the other hand, is a beacon of peace.** Everyone we saw pass through went through when it was their time. The Door is a passive thing, not active: it's just there. The choice to stay or go doesn't change. Chidi went through and didn't hesitate. Tahani didn't go at all and actively rejected it. **No one was forced and it was not violent.** Those who were left behind weren't blindsided by the passing. Saddened, yes--but not traumatized. It simply was the individual's time, after a life and afterlife well spent. I would argue that the Door is actually anti-suicidal, because no one passes through unwillingly before their time. Eleanor tried, but stopped herself, much like a healthy, un-depressed person would do before killing themselves. A person with depression who is actively considering suicide is often dissociative, meaning they aren't fully attached to their actions and may not be thinking of the consequences of actually dying--I certainly wasn’t. I didn't truly want to die, but rather wanted an existence that didn't feel meaningless and didn't cause me pain. ""You can sit on that bench as long as you like,"" is probably Janet's way of giving people the option to change their mind--as so often happens too late with real-life suicide. Suicidal thoughts don't ever tell you that you can change your mind. Never. It's just a constant stream of self-hate. The Door is entirely within a person's control to stay or go. We see this with Jason--he was ready, and then wasn't, so he didn't. When he did finally pass, he went with peace in his heart and joy on his face. TL;DR: The Door is a choice that reflects peace. Suicide is not. In addition, for anyone that needs it. Never be scared to ask for help. Edit: to whoever gave me gold, I appreciate it. But any further awards should go to your local charities. They need it far more than Reddit does.",0
264,"Job hunting is pushing me to the brink of being suicidal.I was recently let go of a long term job, i thought i held quite well. due the recent discovery of having epilepsy and the apparent risk of having a seizure at work.

274,"My (24F) boyfriend (24M) had been degrading me for dropping out of medical school due to my suicidal thoughts. He thinks i'll be a housewife and leech off of him while he becomes a workaholic. Should I continue with the relationship?Hello everyone. I just completed my first semester of medical school and while I expected it to be extremely hard and stressful, I did not expect that it would make me suicidal and depressed. I've already been on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications since I was 17 and I've been managing pretty well. I'm currently on winter break and I realized that I cannot move forward for the sake of my mental health and it's also crushed any interest I had in medicine. I told my boyfriend over the break. He's a 4th year medical student so he understands the stress factors but not the suicidal/depressive tendencies. Although he hugged me and let me cry it out, he seemed to go silent. After I asked again and again, he went into this whole discussion about how I studied so hard for the MCAT and I invested so much time, money, and energy into this entire process including one semester for over 1.5 years. He said he worries that if I'm capable of dropping medical school like this, he's not sure if one day I will also give up easily on ""our relationship"" or our decision to have a child in the future. I was honestly shocked. I did not see any kind of correlation but he's adamant that what he says makes sense. He's not sure if I'm gonna give up on the relationship and ask for a divorce in the future. I do not believe in divorce at all UNLESS it's a 100% necessity so i don't know where he's getting this idea from. When I began dating him, I was hesitant on having kids but that was because I was 22 years old and unsure if I wanted a baby because I've never been in love nor had a reason to think about having a baby. After being with him, i was 100% sure I wanted to have a child with him. It wasn't for him only, I wanted to raise a child myself. I talked to him about kids often and even named our future daughter and we make jokes about it all the time. &#x200B; After that conversation, I was just crushed and went home the next day. Over the last two days, he's been talking about how he's doesn't want to work 70 hours till he's 70 years old to provide for his family. I dropped out of med school, I never said I'm done with my life. He made remarks about how he doesn't want me to be housewife and watching TV all day. And when I called him out on it, he said I mentioned wanting that once. I did, but it was a joke. Obviously I rather watch TV than study for 10 hours straight. He said he didn't want me working a job and wanted a career and when I asked what he meant by ""job"" and he said stuff like ""cashier"" cause it's temp. I used to be a cashier so I was offended that he would even think that I'm going to be a cashier for the rest of my life. His entire vibe about this is how he's screwed over and how his finance would be screwed. I'm not sitting here thinking I have a doctor boyfriend so I can just chill. I want to pave my own path and make a life for myself. &#x200B; I was already so stressed about medical school and I felt immensely better once I decided to drop out. I knew that my even my own amazing parents would support me. I took about 25K loan thats a complete waste but even then that is still the least of my worries. Being unsure of my future career is also another main worry but not as bad as what my boyfriend said. We talked on the phone last night and I told him that i did want him to be honest with me but he could have been honest without being so vile about it. I mentioned that I needed support and care right now because I am at the lowest. I need him to be by my side. Though, he did agree throughout the entire process that even though he didn't support my decision, he supported me because he knew the degree would be worthless if i wasn't alive to use it. After a-lot of crying and explaining and repeating the fact that I need him to be empathic towards me right now, he finally apologized. It wasn't fake. It was genuine. I knew by the tone of his voice and he said he was sorry for throwing in his fears right now when all I needed was for him to support me and for putting me through hell on top of my initial stress. &#x200B; My problem is I don't know if I can move forward in this relationship. We have been together for almost 2 years but after these past three days, I feel like the love was sucked out of me. We shared the same dreams about everything in our future. We did everything together. But now i feel like I'm in fear that he's going to belittle me at the next failure I experience. It feels like he's my enemy rather than my friend. I don't know why I have to scream and yell and cry to ask for some compassion. It feels like tough love but I'm just not even feeling the ""love"" portion. I just feel broken. I deserve more than this because I didn't something horrible. I made a decision to make myself happy in the long run and to have him talk about me ruining his financial future makes me feel like i'm not good enough. I have this urge to break up with him. I feel like he showed me who he is at my lowest. I just don't know how to live a life without him. I'm not sure if I should give him another chance. Should I cut ties or give him another chance? Please give me some advice. Thank you!!",1

276,"Less Suicidal NPCs?It always strikes me as a little weird that level 5 bandits will charge, heedless of his own safety, at a terrifyingly well armed + armored dragonborn (whom everybody else in Skyrim seems to recognize) and at whatever entourage of companions is accompanying the dragonborn. And they'll keep charging until they die. Once in a blue moon, someone will yell ""Victory is your, I submit!"" And then they start hitting you again. Same thing with suicidal wolves and mudcrabs. Back in the oldrim days, kuertee's {Fight or Fly} was a staple in my load order; it made enemies flee on a pretty regular basis, depending on how the fight was going, level differentials, and other factors I'm less certain about. Some enemies would run on sight, others would give up or run as soon as you put up a fight. You know. Immersive. At least one other mod, {Mercy} also made it so human npcs would flee and then sandbox after surrendering. (Arguably less immersive? Must feel awkward in enclosed spaces. Like trying to go about your daily routine while a repairman is over, except with a repairman whom you just unsuccessfully tried to kill.) I'm curious if anyone has had success porting Fight or Fly over to SSE. I'm even more curious to know if someone has made something similar, with improvements or with the benefit of lessons learned from Fight or Fly. I recall that FoF had some bugs and weird behavior; kuertee had posted that he was planning on rebuilding it, but I don't think he ever did. And it left some room for expansion (imagine a battle cry power that would influence the flight odds, or involve an intimidation check).",0
277,"Mother makes her daughter suicidal because daughter is sick of being a parent to her sistersSo I've known this Karen (obv not her real name) my whole life. She's the type of person that complains about maxing out her credit cards and 3 days later books a holiday. She is also always bragging about how perfect her children are, even though her eldist raised them almost by herself. People involved in this are Karen (em), her oldest daughter (d), Karen's brother (u) and her daughter's boyfriend (bf). From the age of about 6, em made d look after her little sisters because em was always too busy with charity work. Me and all of the other friends d had, have always told her that she shouldn't put up with it but she knew that if she didn't cook for her sisters, they'd eat cereal for dinner. I also suspect that she didn't think she deserved a social life because she'd been raised just to be a free babysitter (even when em was home). She got her bf about 4 months before things started kicking off. D started to stand up for herself. She didn't want to have to mother her siblings anymore. Em started flipping out. D constantly had her phone taken off her and was never allowed out of the house. That was when em looked through the messages on d's phone. There was a conversation between her and a friend, where the friend offered her drugs but she refused. She also installed a tracker on d's phone so she always knew her location. D was in mcdonalds, when she had lessons scheduled, but instead of talking to about it, she screamed and shouted about how both were bf's fault. U spoke to her teachers and they said that they'd let her leave because she finished her work early. After that, everytime d left the house, em sent her threatening and berating messages about how ""useless"" she is. Em refused to even look at her when she was in the house. D became very depressed. She was actively planning her suicide while refusing to leave her room or even talk to anyone. U found out about this. He spent a whole day just getting her out of the house and into his car. She took only the essentials with her. U gave her a room in his house but it still took over a month to get her to open up about everything. Em still insists that bf is one of the worst people on the planet. He's probably the sweetest guy in the world. D wasn't going to have an 18th party (because u couldn't afford it) so he told his parents to use the money for his party on her instead. I think the worst part is that em turned up at u's house on d's 18th birthday to give d a car and hope that she'd just forgotten what had happened. D just took the keys, mumbled a ""thanks"" and went back to her room. D and bf have been together for over a year now and are saving to buy an apartment together. She has nothing to do with em anymore and still texts her sisters regularly. TL;DR: Mother makes her daughter suicidal because she's too lazy to actually be a parent. Then she thinks a car will fix everything. Edit: thank you kind stranger, for the silver! Edit 2: omg a gold too! Guys I'm actually going to cry. Thank you!!!",0

279,"Mass importing immigrants is culturally suicidal, morally bankrupt, and should be resisted.Cultures exist because of similarity between people, who then develop tribal traditions and customs. They dress the same, speak with the same accents, develop the same games and pass times. Multiculturalism seeks to improve the pool of genetics in a given state by maximising variety of mates, but increasing that variety is done at the expense of culture, which is destroyed entirely by the introduction of alien beliefs and customs. Suddenly you have to accomodate more beliefs and requirements, which doesn't create a stronger community, it stretches its cohesion to breaking point. This is why big cities develop ghettos - because different cultures can't blend properly, and often don't want to. They resist blending, antagonistically, refusing to share a common language, religion or even clothing. Every conquering nation has acted in the, same manner, and it should not be tolerated. The British did it in America before killing off the locals, the South African colonies, the Spanish in South America, and the colonies in Australia all acted the same way, as feeble immigrants who needed help and tolerance from the locals to survive, but later grew strong enough to take over. No country should let such an insideous thing happen to it. Its flawed morality which makes us do this to ourselves. Nietzsche foresaw it when he pointed out ""Christian slave morality"" - and how we seem to believe that allowing the weak to overcome us and take our place is somehow virtuous and righteous, when any rational thinker can see that its bloody suicidal. Race is not a consideration in this argument, but one can certainly look to protect one's own racial autonomy without hatred or a sense of superiority over another race. I love all the races and celebrate the differences between them. But I wouldn't want them all to be blended into one beige soup. Thats not how we evolved. We are all specialised and should overlap sparingly but without prejudice.",0
280,"After 10 years of ineffective self-improvement, 3 years of being suicidal, and only days before I was planning on killing myself, I have finally managed to get a girl to go on a second date with me.From a very young age, I could always tell that I had an unattractive face, but kept myself sane and hopeful by listening to all the platitudes society shoved down my throat, like I'm sure many of you have. For others, the most important thing in life is family, or friends, or money, or status; for me, it is romantic love. So for 13-year old me, those two facts led to a decade of attempting to improve myself to one day become attractive to someone. I forced myself to become more social, worked on my style, hygiene, started playing basketball seriously, working out, picking up guitar and other hobbies, buying status symbols in clothes, accessories, electronics, cars. I even managed to join a fraternity in college. It was only in my 2nd year of college, after seeing all my friends, fraternity brothers, and classmates hooking up & dating while I was as much of a romantic failure as ever, did I realize all that was bullshit. I realized that no matter how good of a partner you may be on the inside, it all was for nought if you had an unattractive face, even if you have a good body like I do. Cue a very long 3-4 years of being suicidally depressed, intimately deprived, and hopeless. I had a few first dates, maybe once per year, but I was always rejected when asking for a second date. Each rejection weighed on me more and more, and eventually I lost what tiny sliver of hope I had. A few months ago began probably my worst depressive episode. I had planned to kill myself sometime mid-January, and had gathered all the supplies I needed to do it. Literally days before I planned to kill myself, I matched with a really cute girl on Tinder and we hit it off. Two weeks later, we went on our first date and it was easily the best date I've ever been on. I've learned a lot about her and I genuinely really like her. At the end of the date, I kissed her goodbye and asked her out for a 2nd date this weekend, which she enthusiastically agreed to. She even came up with an idea and a plan, which pleasantly shocked me. It feels as if a miracle has happened to me. For the first time in a long while, I have feelings of hope and excitement for the future. I'm still wary because I've gotten my hopes up only to be sorely disappointed in the past, and if this doesn't work out I will certainly end my life. But nonetheless, I can see a light at the end of the tunnel. I hope all of you find similar miracles in your lives. EDIT: Thank you all for the kind words. The second date went even better than the first and I am in the happiest mood I have been in years. I think this might finally be it.",0

283,"CMV: If ""My body, my choice"" applies to abortion, then it applies to physician-assisted suicide as well The whole idea supporting abortion is that it's the women's right to choose what happens to/with her body. If you're able to kill another living thing with a heartbeat via a medical procedure for whatever reason, then that should apply to assisted suicide as well. I can also argue that it fits the ""My body, my choice"" mantra even more than abortion because there is no other (potential) person/life involved. The other argument is: if abortion is illegal, they'll do it under the table anyway and potentially risk infection or even their lives in a ""back alley"" abortion. Why doesn't the same apply for suicide? If someone wants to end his/her life and it's not allowed in a controlled medical procedure, they're going to do it under the table. As you may know, a lot of suicides end in failure, resulting in permanent brain damage, disability, and/or disfigurement.

292,"Did I really watch someone just get shadow banned from the discord for...being suicidal?I'm confused, I was talking to this user for a while and she was pretty on the edge about being suicidal. She was talking to one of the admins in support 3, then ends up banned? She's told me she didn't get a warning, didn't get a message from the bot, and the friends she had in staff have removed her from their friends list. I'm a bit confused like...Did this chick seriously just get banned from your community / server for utilizing services that YOU provide? EDIT: So now that I've got an understanding... 1 ) She wasn't ""shadow banned"" she was banned for being deemed ""colorful"" and to much to handle. I will elaborate more in point 3, but essentially her discussion in the Support channel was deemed as ""attention seeking"" and ""guilt tripping"". 2 ) Her past in two servers where she was sexually harassed and bullied / stalked was somehow bought into question despite upon her first day of joining and being recognized by a stalked she was told by ""zorro"" that they were NOT aware of this nor keeping ""intel"" like this. They basically lied and admitted to her they do have information on her that they refused to disclose. This is illegal. 3 ) A User, by the name Kippy or Klippy? Something like that, she described his profile picture to me and I remember seeing his name around. Had DM'd her, asked for a specific picture, then sent it to staff complaining about her DM'ing him a ""concerning image"" (A gun she had referenced owning) and attempting to guilt trip and ""seek attention"" from him. This was not the case, for whatever reason this user decided to completely bait her into posting an image in DM then using it against her. This same user also was present when she was kicked for 24 hours by responding to a comment made by him. She now believes this user is part of the Two servers / small circle of people who have previously harassed her online. 4 ) This is absolutely horrible, the response from staff basically circle jerking with ""We aren't professionals."" and ""We gave her links."" isn't relevant at all. You market yourselves proudly as a mental health server that fights depression, but when someone on the verge of losing their battle comes to you on their knees you openly go out of your ways to just toss them aside and label them as ""colorful"" and ""problematic"" based off an issue in which they (the user in question here) had to get the police involved due to potential doxxing. When she came to GFD and was told / discovered one of these people was IN the server, she was muted, belittled, and told by Zorro and other staff that they ""couldn't do anything"" and that ""no one had given them information about her."" This was a flat out lie. I'm without a doubt leaving this community and going to attempt to get whoever hands out Discord Partnerships to look into this...this is absolutely NOT how a discord partnered server should be operating. EDIT #2 I'd like to add a Point #5 5 ) You are taking someone who you KNOW / KNEW works with children and twisting them into being some violent behavioral concern for people. This is extremely dangerous knowing that someone on your server is part of a group of people in mental health servers who have doxxed her before. You have literally just given these people material that could absolutely impact her ability to work and find work. This is just another point about how dangerously careless you've handled this situation...allowing people who she warned you about to manipulate her post and intentions into this weird sociopolitical violent personality is insane, like legitimately dangerous and I hope you realize this and make some sort of statement to how fucking reckless you handled this. Last Edit : You people are fucking psychopaths...This entire situation contradicts the purpose of your server...suicidal woman talking to zorro (admin) for help, you claim she was guilt tripping people in DM when from the screenshots I was shown by her, the guy DM'd her first ASKING bait tier questions? All of this happens AFTER She warns you someone in the server is part of a group of people who used to doxx her and she had previously filed a police report again? You just compromised someone's physical and mental safety in favor of putting your meaningless fucking server rules first. You had her Discord disabled, her email made public to her abusers, and her access to mental health support groups revoked. You're like...actually shitty people, every single one of you mods who sat on their high horse telling her ""Oh the Rules though! The Rules, the Rules, the rules!"" I legitimately don't know what to say other than you're actually psychopaths who are playing dangerous games with actually mental ill people who you claim to be here for when you're not.",0

294,“Suicidal” PlayerSo I made a DnD club (with the help of some friends) and we have about 20 members. I decided to split everyone up into groups of about 5 each since there were semi-experienced DMs. I was in a group with 2 friends 1 of which was the DM. Now the “suicidal” player (SP) was fine the first 2 weeks and his friend (F) was basically carrying the whole party. The problems started with him disagreeing with a few things the DM was doing. He argued about allowing the dragonborn use breathweapon multiple times a day without rest and said he was going easy on us.(Our dragonborn was my friend who has never played before) And in our discord SP was insulting everyone and complaining about breaking the rules. Instead of having SP leave I gave him another chance. He was fine for another 2 sessions and then he started becoming a problem. In 1 session he refused to speak at all ( No explanation was given as to why) At the next session he would make actions that would make things harder for the party and make a few comments here and there. In discord SP would make talk by saying things like how he was suicidal and depressed( I have been there so i tried to help) but a week later SP starts going off saying F didnt care about child abuse. I learn from F that he was saying his parents abused him and that he had taken her advice as “So youre siding with my parents!?” and screaming rude comments ( trust me when i say F said nothing of the sort) And here is where the “suicidal” part comes. SP sent a video to F of him drinking “Bleach” saying “ It’s your fault” but ofc it was a fake video and a friend of F reported it to the office and SP got suspended for 2-1 weeks. Surprisingly SP just got super sulky and quit the club. The gameplay was fine when he didn’t act out but the overall experience was ruined for everyone.,0

It was the right decision and neither of us regret it. A few days ago he gets a text from GMIL saying that MIL is back in the hospital. She does not provide any details so we assume it is related to the recent routine medical procedure she had preformed. MIL likes attention and complaining about her health stuff so it's not that surprising she found a reason to go back to the hospital. I probably sound uncaring here but that is her M.O. We are not going to break NC just because she is trying to lay on a guilt trip. MIL has already sent him a text which he ignored and also a card which he returned. A day or so after getting the text he gets a voicemail from another family member who says that it's been a while since she has seen us and wants to see how we are doing etc. He doesn't get around to calling her back for a few days. For the record this family member has always been a JY so we weren't sure if she was being a FM or what. We have not told anyone in his family why we went NC with inlaws because obviously it's not their business and we don't want to be put in the position of having to defend our decision. When SO calls this family member back she tells us that MIL is in hospital because she is suicidal and it's because we aren't talking to her and are not letting her see her grandkids. So yeah...that was unexpected. I have read other people's posts about JN family members doing this but didn't think that it would happen to I us I guess? Honestly I'm really mad at MIL for pulling this crap. Call me heartless if you want to idc at this particular moment in time. Like seriously after everything that SO has dealt with she decides that instead of trying to change her behavior she just ups the ante? Go fuck yourself MIL. I actually have depression, anxiety, and ptsd so I'm not unsympathetic to mental health struggles. But you want to know what I am unsympathetic to? I am very unsympathetic to bullshit. I am also unsympathetic to people crying wolf because they didn't get their way. Sorry I know I'm raging right now but I am just so mad. Ok back to the phone call, I can tell that SO's family member is trying to be kind and probably just wants everyone in the family to be happy and get along and all that. She makes sure to tell him that she isn't trying to tell him what to do, that she knows he has his own reasons for not talking to inlaws, that everyone loves us and isn't upset with us. That she knows MIL can be dramatic and often wants attention. But then she goes on to say that this has been really hard on MIL and faaaaaamily is so important and his parents love him and could he see it in his heart to get in touch with MIL? MIL is just ever so heartbroken at the idea of not getting to see us or the grandkids any more. She was so depressed before the grandkids came along and they gave her something to look forward to. Could we maybe just bring them over to see inlaws sometimes? Like not for a whole weekend or anything but maybe an hour or so? Maybe SO and I could let them watch the kids when we go out on a date? She says that she loves us and just wants to help however she can. SO listens to her whole thing, says that we miss her too and that he is not trying to distance himself from her then politely ends the phone call. I have such mixed feeling about the call. I really do like this family member and I want to believe in my heart that she is only trying to be helpful. I don't want to be mad at her. I keep thinking that maybe if I were in her shoes I would try to mend the rift in my family too? I guess you could say I'm disappointed though. She never mentioned MIL taking responsibility for her actions or behavior, or saying that she was sorry about anything. It doesn't sound like MIL is sorry for anyone but herself. Like what the hell are we supposed to do here? SO is adamant (thank god) that he doesn't want to break NC. I guess it just bothers me that we are looking like the bad guys in this situation. Idk why I care about what his family thinks. I still like many of them and want them to be a part of our lives. It would mean the world to SO to maintain those relationships. I know he worries about having to cut off his entire family. I'm sure MIL is making us sound horrible, oh boohoo poor me I'm in the hospital for being suicidal and my own son won't even talk to me. What if people hate us? It probably shouldn't matter but I guess it does because I'm sitting here worrying about it. I have no idea how I'm going to get any sleep tonight. Thank to anyone who reads this. Edited to add: Family member who SO called back said that she hoped our children did not one day resent us for keeping them from their grandparents. Whether or not she felt this was helpful to say I think it was very uncalled for. My first thought was don't you dare try and tell me who our children should be around. MIL is emotionally abusive, manipulative, lies constantly, disrespects boundaries and rules that SO puts in place, and tries to pretend she is their parent. FIL also lies, disrespects boundaries, and has been creepy and inappropriate towards me and other women. At one point he asked me if I wanted to go on a monthly date with him. They are not people who should be around ANY children especially my own.",0
296,"The AI is suicidal So I was on one of those flashpoint missions where you have to provide support to an allied lance and help them escape the field. Apparently there is a trigger that will cause them to ""make their escape"" when they think the OpFor is weak enough. Anyway, I am in Martian terrain that is mostly flat with a few dust storms here and there. The mission is going very well; we are turning the OpFor (two full lances of heavies) into a smoldering junkpile, but have only finished off about half of the mechs. The allied lance says they are going to begin their extraction, so they make a dead sprint for the extraction point...right on the other side of the remaining 3-4 enemy mechs. They just sprint right through them, not even caring about exposing their backs or taking gift shots. Fortunately the remaining mechs had already been softened up by my artillery and ballistics, and I was able to charge in my Battlemaster to pull their attention away. But that definitely could have gone worse. Had another one once on an urban map, where they charged right at an opposing Atlas. I was able to take it out, but the Atlas got a lucky AC headshot on my King Crab and sent the pilot to the memorial wall. I know this comes as a shock to all of you, but escort missions (of all varieties) have some issues. LOL",0

301,"The First Time They Tried to Kill Me I originally posted this is justnomil but they recommended I put this one here. So I decided to create a new account because I’ve heard that my mothers FM are thinking about using Reddit. While I don’t know for sure if that’s true I just need to be careful because my son and mines position is so precarious right now. I’ve posted some on here before with my other account but now I need to start working on purging all this from my head. Also, I apologize every time because I’m always on mobil. Also I’ve not had it anywhere close to as bad as most people here, I just need somewhere that someone will understand without the “you’re crazy” looks or immediately defending that it couldn’t/can’t be that bad. I’m not a witty writer as much as I wish I was, and there’s not a lot of stories that aren’t just depressing I spent so much time the last few days reading so many different people’s experiences that I finally have the strength to take some of the things that are locked inside me so hard and finally talk about them. I’m gonna borrow a comment from u/Libida that I came across, “gods I’m surrounded by justno’s.” I have an Nmom, Nbrother, Nsister-in-law, Nniece 1, Nnephew 1, Ndaughter and two Nex’s. But by Danu did I have a blingy Yes daddy, MGF (maternal grandfather), and MGM (maternal grandmother). All the things I need to get out has all these people at some point in time staring right along with my mother because she couldn’t be a justno to me all by herself.. I have a couple that o need to get off my chest tonight or I’ll never get any sleep. So we’re gonna start aaaaaaalllllllllllllll the way back in that era of ghastly clothes but some damn good music known as the first part of the 80’s when I was born. As the story I’ve been told all my life that for the first time in 200 years I was the only person in my entire family that wasn’t born in Alabama, Mississippi or Tennessee. Can we say I was the SG black sheep of 98% of my family??? So my parents and brother were living in a smaaaaaalllllllllllll town in the northern part of Arizona, but the closest hospital was across the border in California. Now mother goes into labor and they rush off to the next state for me to be born. Now this is the only time i know of that daddy didn’t have that titanium shine with mother. Instead of leaving bro with someone from daddy’s church that they had made arrangements with he was in the room when I was born because mother just HAD to have her baby boy with her. Now he was 7 when I was born. Well I’m born and we’re discharged the next day. Well I should note that bro also had the flu, daddy told him point blank not to get close till he was better. Weeeeelllllllllll a day or two later daddy had to go to the church to take care of something and bro decided he wanted to hold me. My mother, the RN, let my flu ridden bro hold me and I wasn’t even 5 days old. Can anyone guess what happened???? Late that night they were in the emergency room with me because I was running a 103 fever. I ended up in the NICU where it was also discovered I’m allergic to iodine. (Because of course I am). I spent two weeks in the NICU, mother left after they had me admitted and didn’t come back till I was discharged. That was the first time my bro tried to kill me, and I’ve spent the last 30 plus years getting to hear how it’s just sooooooooo funny from mother and bro, who were of course only saying that part when daddy wasn’t around. Here’s a little bonus that I enjoy getting to point out to people when I can. I mentioned where my family was from, well I don’t know if it’s my “backwards thinking” or because I was raised in the deserts of Arizona, but I don’t hold the same beliefs as my family. Now mother and bro pride themselves on being good Christian southern Baptist and they accept everyone for who they are (my eyes can’t go back any further). But wait what happens when some one whose not “gods people” comes close to them????? I love watching that CBF going on because they don’t wanna give up their (good Christian image.”",0

303,"Season's 2 editingLove the show but the editing this season has really bothered me. I loved Andrea Arnold's work on Transparent, so this isn't a dig on the director, but this season has rather been strange to watch. First few episodes were fine, but the editing got so choppy recently and last episode's ending montage was the epitome of it. Tonally it came out of nowhere, there was no momentum to that big Corey reveal, it was quick cutaways between huge, suspenseful scenes and other fluffy moments but it had no weight emotionally for me. The confusion about ""do we know that character?"" didn't help either. Look, the flashbacks and visions scenes are pretty uninspired, but I was fine with that because Jean-Marc Vallée is just that good and not easy to recreate, and having a montage practically at the end of each episode is .... whatever, but Kill Me ending montage just ruined what should have been a huge moment, and given how there are only 2 episodes left, the show just can't afford it. Another weird thing is the fact there are like 10 people credited for editing and it's a little strange. I don't know whether it's BTS drama but it feels like one of those Fox reedited movies, I don't know. I'm just really frustrated and bummed out. This show was so fun to watch, but this season I found myself just going through the motions. Now I do believe the script isn't helping either, but the editing (with the cast and acting) is what made this show more than a soapy drama, and losing that level of quality in editing is having more repercussions than I expected. EDIT: Typo on the title, apologies. New phone and still getting used to the keyboard.",0

308,"Travis Gafford doesn't know how to interview (don't kill me)Travis Gafford has done a lot for the scene; nobody would deny that. He has immense presence in the LCS, LES, and any league necessary for him to conduct an interview. Everything he does sheds light on the scene and gives us outsiders insight we could never dream of getting, if not for him. I respect that. I respect him. I am grateful for everything he does. With that said...I watched the interview with him and Parth shedding light on TSM's current situation. I encourage you to watch it too if you don't like my title. What does he contribute to the interview? He asks a question, (preprepared, scripted, no doubt) and then he sits there for several minutes until the question is answered. He doesn't move. He doesn't react. Worst of all, he doesn't even acknowledge anything Parth says as he moves into the next question. ""Your team didn't do so well last year compared to TSM standards. What do you think about next year's team?' ""Well, I think we've built a stronger team and am confident in next year's results."" ""That's great you have confidence in next year's lineup. What do you think about how this team can transition into ""xyz"" compared to last year?"" That's just an example. How hard is it to say one sentence relating what your interviewee had answered you and tie it into your next question? It's not. In this interview Travis looked checked out and didn't offer any thought into the interview. It was as if he was on autopilot and just reading off a script until he ran out of bullet points. He just asks the next thing as if Parth hadn't spoken at all. This is interviewing 101. This is speaking 101. If you want your audience, or cospeaker, to feel engaged you need to acknowledge that you are at least listening to what they say. This is not prevalent in his interviews. He asks his, no doubt scripted, question and then when they finally stop talking he asks the next question. Then he sits there and waits for them to shut up again so he can ask the next question. This is not an ""interview."" This is an info dump. You might as well let Parth (or whomever) monologue about whatever talking points they want to cover for however long and then stop it and throw it on your channel. This isn't journalism. This isn't ""reporting."" This is a priveleged person who gets to know things nobody else could know, revealing it to the public. Fine. Reveal it. Let them say whatever they want. Throw it on your channel. Monotize it. I don't care. Just don't pretend it's an interview. You're sitting there, waiting for them to stop talking, not even acknowledging their responses, and then blitzing out another question. Don't pretend that's an interview. Or journalism.

311,"A guy from a party tried to kill me and I thought it was a teachable moment.I'll try to make a long story short, I was doing a guy I barely know a favor, but when I told him I was giving his car keys to his parents because I didnt trust him with them, he snapped. He grabbed a fire extinguisher from his car and said ""I didnt want to have to do this, you made me"" He had already said he would ""slit my throat"" ""make sure you're going to die tonight"" multiple times prior, so when he grabbed a fire extinguisher I started to take him seriously. Guy was being quite the jerk all night and there was a girl I just met and another drunken friend who was very scared looking on. I grappled him, he tried to bite off my ear and my chest through my jacket, he tried to gouge my eyes leaving scratches and bleeding on my face. I held him in a pin and told him ""I'm your friend and I'm going to do everything I can to keep you safe tonight"" Eventually he was arrested for a DUI after escaping his parents house where I had left him, but I felt I did everything I could to help. Now my one friend stayed quiet but the girl was angry with me. She wanted me to hurt him, she didnt talk to me again after that and she was completely sober. I tried to explain that I didnt believe in fighting but it was an awkward ride home (she elected to drive me home so I could drive the guy home in his car, we are nice people). Quick flex I'm 240 pounds, at one time the best highschool wrestler in the country, I do MMA and in the top 1% for fitness. I heard a quote today ""those who have weapons and keep them sheathed shall inherit the earth"" That really resonated with me. Maybe I'm wrong. Everyone has their own opinions. *edit* While the quick flex was definitely a brag, It is an important detail. If I was an average guy, I don't know who I'd be or how I'd react. But I've always been bigger and athletic. Psychologically speaking I might be a very different person if I grew up otherwise. I never thought about it until recently someone pointed out that it was the reason I'm never scared in situations like that. Maybe that's true, but I dont know.",0
312,"Made the discovery that breakfast absolutely KILLS ME.I’ve only been back on the wagon for about a week, but have been determined that this time it’s going to stick. I’m 32 years old, enough is enough, I don’t have the luxury of deciding to fall off the wagon haha So, in an effort to really do things right, for the last week I’ve been starting the day with a serving of oatmeal, about 110 calories plus a splash of milk. I figured this is a nice healthy grain that would stick to my ribs. Unrelated (or so I thought), I’ve been MISERABLE since day 1- just constantly thinking, dreaming, craving more food. I’ve come in at or under my calories every day, but it was rough. Day before yesterday, I decided to double my oatmeal consumption (2 servings at 220 calories total) in hopes that it would help with my insane hunger. It was a huge bowl and super satisfying in the moment, but the rest of that day was the absolute worst one of the whole run. I was at work and wasn’t able to DO anything because my mind was so hyper focused on needing more food. I was starving and miserable and going insane. I figured, this is weight loss in your 30’s, deal with it. Yesterday, I was running late so brought my packet of oatmeal with me to work with the intent of scarfing it down upon arrival. Of course, I got busy and just...forgot. And then lunch time rolls around, so I eat my lunch. And the rest of the day was SO PLEASANT. I wasn’t thinking about food at all. I wasn’t hungry at all. I just...was. By the end of the day, I came in under my goal by about 200 calories. And when I went into the freezer to get ice for my ice water, and saw the thin mints sitting there, I considered having a couple because I had the calories...but then went “meh, I’m not really in the mood for them. I’d rather just have my ice water”. And then I closed the freezer and didn’t think about those thin mints again- which never happens with me. Today, I skipped breakfast again just to make sure yesterday wasn’t a weird fluke. And so far, so good. Everyone always says breakfast is the most important meal of the day. I bought into that hard. Screw breakfast.",0

315,"My JNML hates me and would kill me if she had her wayEdit: TW- DEATH THREATS/PHYSICAL AND MENTAL ABUSE First, this is an obvious throwaway and I'm on mobile so forgive the formatting. You may have even read this story if you've browsed r/borrow (Note: I'm not posting here for any help, just to vent to people who understand crazy JNMILs.) Heads up, it's gonna be a long one. Due to financial difficulties and my FILs death, my family of four had to move in with MIL a few months ago. If there had been an alternative, I damn sure would have taken it. She had hated me since the day I married her baby boy and only son sixteen years ago. She said that was the single worst day of her life. The day we got married she got so mad at my months over centerpieces that she shoved her into a grandfather clock and broke three of my mother's ribs. Since we've been here, it's not stop fighting. Like, she hits and shoves me and tells me I'm a liar, thief, whore, bitch, gutter trash, etc. The four of is share one small room and she takes half of my husband's small check each payday (week) for rent, amounting to $600 a month. I have a promising full time job hopefully that I'll have an answer on this week. Right now I'm a substitute preschool teacher and rarely do they need to call me in. Most of my husband's check goes to health insurance for the four of us. She won't allow lights on and my son does his homework by the light of his tv monitor. I do all the cleaning, all the dishes, and decluttered her house because it was nasty when we moved in. I've pressure washed the house, privacy fence, walk way, and do the landscaping. I wash all the towels. I keep every room except the bedrooms we aren't in clean without ever having been asked to do so. I'm always doing nice little things for her trying to win a tiny bit of affection and see least avoid her absolutely crazy screaming at me for that day. There's truly something mentally wrong with her but she's never honest with her doctor. She's been ten times worse since the beginning of the year. She tells me she hates he and now knows why my mother didn't want me. My husband says if I stop responding to her and let her just get it out of her system, then it wouldn't get so bad. But I feel like I need to defend myself when she says these awful things. Thursday, she got mad at me for something or another and started shoving me and hitting me. Then she told me she'd kill me (not the first time), and this time actually went to the knife drawer but thankfully it was empty. Until then, I haven't reported her to law enforcement because she tells me she'll just put on an ""I'm just a 74 year old elderly woman, how could I possibly be strong enough to hurt anyone, I'm so feeble and sugary sweet!"" My husband, when he's not working full time and is home to witness this, says to keep my mouth shut so it'll deescalate tells us both to stop. I wish he'd stand to to her more but it would cause her to kick us all out in the street and he is just trying to make it to our tax return so we can move the hell out and never come back. The next day, she shoved me into a counter and i hit it at the small of my back, where I already have pain due to medical issues. Then she stressed threatening to kill me again, and hitting me. I'd had it. I had recorded audio of some arguments and threats and was going to use them if ever needed. Yesterday in finally called the police and they took statements from us all. I went to get my phone to let them listen to the recordings but she'd b his it under the stairs and it was hours before I finally found it. The police in our area are a joke. They just gave me victim's rights brochures, listened to her little old lady act, didn't arrest her due to ""conflicting statements"", and said they're file a report. Ohhhh.... Now she's pissed. She filed anb eviction notice for just me, not my family. I have thirty days and no money, no where to go. She won't allow me to wash or dry even my kids school clothes. She told me I better not take one bite of any food she had or makes. This was a jab because I'm anorexic. She made dinner last night and told me to tell the kids they had food in the kitchen. I don't have any friends around so I don't have anyone to ask about staying with and my family isn't nearby. With no extra money, no way to get a loan, all the public assistance on backlog, I'm screwed. She's the just awful hateful person I've ever met. She told me I finally crossed the line by calling the police. We usually get out refund around March so at least then we can all get a place together away from her. my kids are being mentally affected because they can hear the screaming through the walls. My little girl is heartbroken because Mommy won't be here to keep MIL from picking on her (she doesn't like my daughter and does plenty for my son), and she can't go to sleep without me. I didn't tell hey I'm just as sad, too. And MIL tells me God is going to strike me down for being so awful to HER. So, that's my JNMIL contribution.

316,"My Ndad May Be Planning to Kill Me TomorrowI don't know if this sounds paranoid, but I think that my Ndad may try to murder me some time soon - possibly as early as tomorrow. My mother died in a ""mysterious house fire of unknown cause"" just months after she was granted with the majority of custody of my brothers and I. Until last year no one had done anything else to hinder my father's control. He cheated my grandfather out of money by telling him that he needed it for rent or for his kids when he already had a well paying job, and stole tens of thousands of dollars from my brother's and my inheritance from my mother. Last year he tried to do it a second time, I didn't allow him too. Instead I told the executor of the account what happened, and now my father has no trust from that side of the family, or any way of taking the money. I didn't talk to him for almost a year, and when I did, I was met with manipulation and threats. The first threat was on the phone. He told me that he had blocked my messages to him ""for my own safety."" I originally rolled my eyes at that, but he's only gotten worse. When I asked him if we could discuss having some sort of an amiable relationship over Christmas, originally he sent me a text basically disowning me and how he was disgusted after my ""episode from last year"" ... of which I replied to him not to gaslight me and that the only ""episode"" was him trying steal from me again. Then suddenly out of no where he became almost sickly sweet in response and wanted to meet me in the new year. We had a video chat with the family over Christmas and he acted like nothing had ever happened and that everything was all right --- which was really out of character after the texts a week before. That was until he mentioned in an off moment when my brother's computer glitched that he has a rifle. I've never known him to have a gun in the house, and why the heck would he mention it when I was talking about how my dog is scared of nerf guns? (We were talking about animals - not guns in particular.) I decided to meet him tomorrow at a public restaurant, but something about his wording is really screwing with me. He texted me about making a ""final choice"" about our relationship. I'm only 31, so there should be nothing ""final"" about it. It's a long life, right? I'm really worried that if I don't submit to his controlling tactics that he's going to kill me and his unborn grandchild. Maybe my house will be burnt mysteriously too - or even worse, he may shoot me. Am I paranoid? My fiance told me that he's going to wait for me in the restaurant parking lot for safety... I'm worried that my dad may be waiting there too with a rifle and has not intention of talking to me at all. Update: Thank you everyone for your comments and concern. I haven't replied to them because I'm having a moral dilemma about whether to go or not (the meeting is at 4:30pm pst). So many of you don't want me to go, but for the sake of fixing a huge rift in my family, I still feel like I should. It's not only for me. It's for my brothers, my aunt, and my grandfather so we can all go about life as usual again without 'an elephant in the room'. I really do think that I'm just being paranoid and that my father is just being a manipulative narcissist as usual. He uses threats and intimidation with everyone. It's just who he is. I'm not going to back down or let him gaslight when we do talk... and I think it's long past due that I stop being so scared. He's an old cripple with an inflated ego. That's all that I'm going to let him be to me. Note that I've also created a plan to stay safe - and making this reddit post was part of it, along with calling people and telling them the plan, as well as the precautions I'm taking in the plan itself. Again, I thank you all for your concern and I'll keep you updated with what happens. Update 2: The meeting is over and I'm safe. I got to the restaurant parking lot half an hour early in my fiance's work vehicle and made sure that my father entered the restaurant before I did. The meeting basically consisted of him denying that he stole anything, telling me that I don't need to know where any money went because ""his past with money is tragic,"" and then gaslighting that legal paperwork is meaningless (looool)... I tried to focus on feelings because getting him to tell the truth is like getting water to flow uphill. He told me that he was hurt because I called him names like ""thief"" when I first confronted him. Poor guy thinks that he's a victim. In the end we decided to be amiable, but I don't think that I'll be visiting him any time soon. He's still a narcissistic weirdo. In conclusion, we're going to set up a security system with motion censor cameras for the house. My father's demeanor was still far from friendly whenever small-talk wasn't being said. I don't want to take any chances with house fires. Thanks again for your concerns guys! It truly touches me that people really do care, even over the internet.",0
317,"My dad is going to kill meI’m 21 years old, and over the years I’ve had many boyfriends and have experienced a lot. Of course, my dad doesn’t even know any of it. I recently started dating someone good and worthy, he’s everything I’ve ever wanted in a man and this guy is really important to me. I really want to introduce him to my dad (I’ve never introduced any of my boyfriends to my dad) but idk how to tell my dad about the fact that I’m dating someone without him going crazy protective on me, let alone introducing him to my boyfriend. I’m scared that once he finds out he’s going to get so much stricter and will stop me from seeing him etc. I literally want to do this in the best way possible and I don’t know which way is the best way",0

319,I want to fucking die My room is a fucking disaster. I’m seeing my boyfriend at the end of this week but that doesn’t even matter. I love him but we have to be long distance now. He is 9 hours ahead. I don’t know when I’ll see him after this and I don’t know how long I can handle this. I don’t want anyone else I love this man and only him. But who cares. My rooms a mess I’m a mess and I want to die. This is a new account but about a year ago I posted here and got help. Now I’m back again. I relapsed with self harm and bulimia. I don’t care. I just want to die. I don’t make sense I know and that’s because my brain is fuzz. I can’t make it till Friday to see him. I can’t even make it through the fucking day. Someone kill me please.,1

She said it’s normal to feel that way now but it’s “not normal” and one thing led to another and I’m starting conversion therapy next week which even if it could I won’t let change me because her biggest reason for me to change is that I’m “Muslim”, good thing I’m an atheist then.

325,"Has it ever occurred to you that you might just fucking die?!That's something I think you need to ask yourself, there are more important and healthier things out there other than pornography. And sitting in your room alone at night, with your cell phone beating your meat to some banging hot chick, does that really make you happy? Honestly, there are skills, talents, jobs that you were created for. Do you really want to die being a bloody wanker? We never know when our time is up, so ask yourself. If you had a death counter above your head and it was a predetermined time, would you still be the same? Fuck no, you'd work your fucking ass off trying to make an impression because at the end of the day you know you won't be here one day. What I'm trying to tell you is you have the potential to change your fucking life, you are far stronger than any fucking addiction and your greatest fear should be never reaching your greatest potential.

326,"Seeing men objectively less attractive than me with partners makes me want to fucking die.I originally made this post by accident on a different account but deleted it. (I'm a fucking dipshit retard, I know). I’ve been trying for the last year to lose weight and have been somewhat successful (50+lbs). Still, obviously, I get no attention from women whatsoever. As the title suggests, seeing beautiful women with guys that are waaaayy fucking fatter than me is perhaps the most potent suicide fuel there is. I had to watch my adorable, petite brunette coworker talk to her fucking ogre-looking SO yesterday. It was fucking hideous. This is what I get for fighting a food addiction? This is what I get for toiling for all this time? To have to still be ignored and alienated and then be mocked by the sight of fat lumbering dipshits with gorgeous women on their arms? What the fuck? Not having a relationship has destroyed my life, and I have to deal with seeing people who treat their bodies with nothing but indifference and poor lifestyles get rewarded. I fucking want to die.

327,"If Olaf just wants to fucking die, why doesn't he actually go fight those dudes that are nearly impossible to kill?Lore-wise, Olaf is like, this dude who wants an honorable death, similar to Saurfang in WoW but less Orcish, he is getting kinda old for a Warrior as he is nearly 50 and he still hasn't yet been bested in battle by anyone, and that's kind of his thing. He is also on Sejuani's faction which is warlike and shit but I doubt Olaf would want to go against his own tribe. However, most other ""competitors"" are out of reach. He probably wouldn't be able to fight Darius or Garen on head-to-head combat, because, he'd probably have to run down an entire army just to be able look at then. Tryndamere would be an obvious ""partner"" he could try to fight, but although he is brave and ""borderline immortal"", Olaf would just run into the same problem as before. He'd probably not be able to get even close to the fucker because Tryndamere just wouldn't bother dealing with that shit. He'd just let the Avarosan footmen deal with the Barbarian the same way he lets the Avarosan sentries deal with his wife. And then you have those other puny fighters like Riven or Yasuo who'd just fucking die?? Like, not only are they hidden somewhere in Ionia, they'd wouldn't even put up a fair fight if they were to fight this absolutely battle-hardened barbarian (not ingame though cuz they sell a lot of skins and Riot needs to make them $$$) So this leaves those guys that roam around the map that everyone knows where they are because, well, they just kill everything, yet they work alone like all the time. Shit like Sion would probably be easier than Darius to get to because, well, not only is he fucking huge, he is also extremely strong and he doesn't give a fuck about no army. He ""accidentally"" kills some Trifarian soldiers during battles because those Trifarian dudes don't bother looking at the minimap and noticing the absolute fucking mammoth coming their way. Another potential target would be Aatrox. Not only is he also fucking huge, but he is kinda easy to spot (if you hear about a bunch of people dying somewhere in the deserts of Shurima on Fox News or something, he is probably there doing his thing). Aatrox doesn't hide, Aatrox doesn't have an entire army behind him to back him up, Aatrox just wants to fucking die too and to take the entire world with him along the way, idk, it seems like a win-win scenario. You either die to someone who bests you in battle or you kill a dude that commits at least 3 massacres every week and people go like ""hey that's cool Olaf, now can you go back to herding sheep and shit?"" He could also go for Mordekaiser but he'd probably have to fight a million shitty ghouls just to get to him so what even is the point. Also, he doesn't even live in our own world anymore so he'd need to die himself to even find the dude in the first place. And there's like other fighters which are like ""too big to handle"". Like, yeah, he'd probably die against Malphite but that's because he is literally a fucking mountain. Not even honorable at that point tbh, just a fancy suicide. Cho'gath isn't as tall but still probably too tall to beat. --- Also, kinda off-topic but I always felt it was kinda weird people refer to Malphite as a dude. He legit walks around naked yet I see no mountain cock.",0

336,"I'm a dumbass and I'm going to fucking die. I hate crushes.So obviously there's this guy I like. Sadly he's from my work. Sadly he knows my family. Ugh. But I've been seriously crushing on him for like the last 4 months (I thought he was cute as fuck the moment I met him tho ha), when he started like truly interacting with me. Like he teases me and shit. Anyway, He told me something about liking me like a month and a half ago but... not like... like like but also that's what he could have been going for because I fucked up and completely couldnt word correctly and somehow he got this idea I liked someone else and not him and just. Ugh. I fucked up. He had this really annoyed/upset look on his face if you know what I mean. but I couldnt think and I left without fixing it. Then I tried texting him? asking what he meant. No reply. And the next day I saw him he kinda avoided me and was like super tense when he teased me and I. Like I knew what I needed to do but it's hard for me to say what I need to say when other people are around you know. So like the dick I am I didnt say anything. Month goes by, very little amount of teasing and he's around someone ALL THE TIME. And everytime there is an opportunity I either dont even think about it as an opportunity or you know, I coward out. The other day I somehow got the courage to do it and even go way out of my way too and he acted like he had no idea what I was saying. That's the last time I saw him and omfg. IM SO FUCKING AWKWARD AND CRINGEY. UUUUGH SAVE ME IM TOTALLY FUCKED. But I've also been thinking he might piece it together and might figure it out himself and if he doesnt well obviously he wouldnt be as smart as I think he is. But also maybe he doesnt actually like me. good god. IM SO EMBARRASSING. But anyway the reason I'm here, the week that first thing happened, like before it happened I had this dream where I kissed him after he explained to me how he didnt understand how I wasnt getting he liked me. Like hello dream thanks for that messaging. But like, I've had crushes before but I could never picture being with them let alone have a dream about passionately kissing them. Like again thanks brain for that messaging. So now after this fucked catastrophe I brought on myself, Last night I just had the SOFTEST dreams. DREAMS! THERE WERE TWO OF THEM. I dont remember one of them very greatly but we were being really silly and dancing and laughing and JUST HOLY FUCK. That was the second dream. The one before it was SO SOFT TOO. All I remember about it was we were standing next to each other and I think I was worrying about him liking me or something. I think it was very much a ""if he figured it out and he really did like me"" scenario. But he like took my hand in his so gently and locked our fingers together before he smiled and leaned down and kissed me. At a much different pace then the other dream. Anyway I'm dead and my mind is just. Why mind. Why. Why now. (obviously because I'm a dumbass) Hopefully this all is somewhat understandable.",0

It’s just when she ignores me all night after standing me up on dates that trigger me. She has cheated on me many times and developed relationships with people behind my back. I cannot trust this person whatsoever ever. She just knows my trauma because it happened to her and she is mentally ill as well. She is really selfish though or at least I feel like because she will respond with maybe a “hey” after I give like a wall of text explaining how she made me feel and how it hurts. She even said she doesn’t care. She is the only one I’ve been this intimate with and if she doesn’t stop I know I will kill myself. The reason being is that my parents are no different than her and I feel so much of a failure. My family is full of geniuses and I dropped out. I’m changing but I really fucking hate being betrayed.

351,"Hi. I'm a mom and wanted to say something I'm a browser, not a poster. I come here to read because of my own doubts, but that's not my point today. I have been reading a lot of desperate posts on here from young people expressing the wish to die or run away. I want you to know your life is worth living and you are worthy of enjoying your time on this planet. Hang in there and don't give up. My son ""came out"" to me as an atheist quite a few years ago and although I was upset, I accepted it because really what choice do I have? He is my baby. My own family rejected me for leaving our catholic faith to become a muslim, so I know that pain and would never do that to my baby. He grew up without grandparents because of me and I feel guilty enough about that. I hate the idea of my baby being in hell, because him being hurt is my worst fear. I would set myself on fire if I knew it would keep my son from being hurt, so I could never hurt him intentionally by disowning him, you get me? His happiness and safety are my #1 priority in life. I guess that's difficult to understand if you aren't a parent, but if you ever happen to become a parent, you might understand where I'm coming from. My life means nothing to me if my child is not happy and taken care of. He is near 40 years old and I would still drop everything to go help him if I knew he was struggling even a little bit. As a parent, I seriously I cannot fathom how parents can abuse, abandon and honor kill their own children. 40 years later, I still can't understand how my own family just left me behind like our lifelong relationship meant nothing to them. How can you look at this innocent little creature you created and not feel intense love for them? How can you watch them grow up and wish anything but happiness and safety on them? If you really want them to be muslim/christian/etc, doesn't it make sense to keep them alive, loved and safe so they have a chance and desire to reconvert? What purpose does disowning them do, except tear apart a family? Yes, I want my son to go to jannah. But he's able to make his own choices. I am here for him no matter what he does with his life, good or bad. I don't have to agree with his choices to be a mother to him. He is worthy of enjoying his life, the only worldly life he gets, and so is every other human being on this planet. Sorry for the long rant. I don't know why I wanted to say this here or if it will help anyone. But you are worthy of love. If your family refuses to love you, know that the world is filled with people who will love you for what you are. My family removed their love, but I found love in a kind man who gave me an equally kind son. The loneliness of being abandoned is unbearable, but I am glad I didn't commit suicide when I was going to, because then I wouldn't have my wonderful son or grandchildren. You deserve the same happiness no matter what you choose to believe in, and no matter what your family says.",0
352,"No emotion So I have come to a point after many years of depression and a self-depricating mindset that the only emotions I feel anymore are annoyance and frustration. These emotions are triggered, so it's not like an anxious constant frustration, only about 2 hours of each per week I would say. Any other times it's only neutrality. Anger, pleasure, joy, stress, all gone. Except for a brief 3 month period over a decade ago, for the first time since I can remember I don't feel depressed and lonely. I have made a certain lifestyle decision that I think is against the rules to elaborate upon, but I don't know whether to be worried. I mean, isn't an almost complete lack of emotion a sign of some sociopathic killer type of thing? I have never had murderous impulses and condemn human suffering, but from what I understand no emotion is a very bad type of thing. Or maybe it is peacefulness and I'm not sure that I know how to process this. I don't want to be crazy, but that type of thing isn't something one has control over, is it? Then again my suicidal tendencies are stronger than ever. Without a filter of emotion with which to process my thoights and motivations, I don't know where my thoughts and actions amy take me.",1
353,"WOW everyone here is my life savior!! Hi everyone, I've been reading the forum for a few hours and I can't believe how alone I'm NOT!!! I've cried, I've even yelled at the computer at some peoples posts and responses...out of love of course not anger...but who am I to judge, right? I'm on the fence of of suicide once again in my life...I've convinced myself that my presense is a bother to the small amount off people in my so-called life. That's including my daughter and my cheating husband in Iraq returning home in 2 days.... my suicide attempts in the past have been weak and just cries for help...yet I'm seriously considering it now...no holds bar...not talking to anyone about it...waiting for the right amount of meds to take, decided if I was really going to do it...why go to work, why pay my bills this month...why tell anyone? Honestly I don't want to die, I don't want to leave my daughter but she's 13 right now and naturally selfish by age...so I've convinced myself she's better off, she has her father who will give her a better life than I can. I love my job, yet that is ending in 6 weeks...off to umemployment I go...which won't cover my bills or rent, so I'm forced to have my daughter move in with her dad 4 hours away....I did have everything till the day I found out my husband cheated on me 3 days before he left for Iraq. I tried to stay strong...and didn't even tell him I knew because of where he was and didn't want to cause him more stress ""over there""...yet after 4 months of verbal abuse from him accusing me of cheating and doing whatever I want because he's not around I had it and told him....he changed his tune after that....then I found out about a girl online he was starting a internet relationship with...that's when I decided to leave...and I did being strong and standing up for myself and not teaching my daughter that it's okay to let people shit on you.... So I hear I sit on a pathetic sunday afternoon writing to you guys...cause someone hear may understand or relate...no one in my life understands...everyone thinks i'm idiot for leaving my husband casue atleast with him i was financially okay....sometime i think they were all right cause atleast back then...i didn't want to die...i just felt like i was dying a slow death....o yeah..I drink all the time too..another habit i started in the past 6 months....I'm even considering cutting now...I did it back when I was a teenager....I liked back then thought maybe doing that would give me a few more days.....I'm messed up and alone....and I'm really just looking for some friends...that can relate and I do the same....I really don't want to die alone....",1
354,"""Hope"" I have a ""see what happens"" approach to suicide. I guess for some people that's just hope. I don't like calling it that because it doesn't come off as being like a grounded solution. I like painting what could happen as a possibility that's almost pointless not to observe, because that's something my thinking brain can understand. That keeps me alive without really keeping my ""hopes"" up. Sometimes even that feels pointless, though. Sometimes I'm just suffering because whatever, fuck me I guess. Like there's no reason for it, and no reason to endure it. Better to post that here than to crave sympathy from actually nobody.",1
355,"Dealing with the demons I could probably write for hours about why I feel the way I do but the gist of it is that I don't feel like life has anything for me. I'm going through a lot of crap recently, and while I understand a good portion of it is self inflicted I can't escape the dark thoughts in my head....I've never tried to harm myself previously but life has been feeding me relentless shit for almost two months solid (and obviously before that, it's just that previously there were bits of happiness to break up the funk). It terrifies me that one day I'll be all alone (like always) and just decide I've had enough. It would be over in seconds. There would be no more pain, hurt, betrayal, lies, nothing but the perfection that can only exist in nothingness. I know there's good in the world. I'm sure there is. But I don't make friends well and my own family doesn't even seem to really care all that much. I so desperately want to just find a friend I can talk to about this shit. I've been told I need to see a counselor. I don't. I don't need just an hour of help per week. I need somebody I can text and talk to at 3AM when I'm at work all by myself with no distractions and I know the girl I love is laying down to sleep with someone else. I need to step back from the edge, and I guess I need to be convinced that the edge isn't all that great to begin with. Is there a term for any of this? Not necessarily wanting to kill yourself but feeling like one horrible thought or realization would push you over the edge? It's literally driving me crazy and I just don't know what to do anymore. Thanks for reading I guess. Hopefully this works. I'm running out of ideas.",1
356,"another close call today i was sitting in my room, writing down some thoughts in a notebook, and i suddenly had a really strong urge to commit suicide i thought about it pretty hard... two of my roommates were home, but they were in the other room, and my other roommate was out of the apartment. i knew my other two roommates wouldnt notice anything, if anything they would think i was sleeping but probably wouldnt question it. i didnt even think of how my roommate would react when she came home... i didnt really care. the only thing that stopped me was the fact that i was pretty sure i'd heard that committing suicide that way is a really painful/slow process and i wouldnt want to put myself through all that. it was terrifying though... i mean, ive stopped myself twice now, but what about next time? will anything stop me then? its especially scary that the fact that people were right in the next room didnt really stop me or anything.... im just really scared, and i dont want to talk to anyone, not even my therapist... i feel like ive gone backwards, like i cant talk to my roommate anymore, i cant talk to my therapist, i cant talk to my friends... i feel like my roommate is tired of me talking to her and i know its stressing her out and she hasnt asked me how i am in a while so im assuming she doesnt want me to talk to her anymore... so im not... but thats also causing me to close up to everyone else as well...",1

359,"Lost my sister .. and perhaps myself .. Honestly .. I happened upon this site in searching for an answer as to why I have been so depressed and thinking ... . Sept 12th was the date my older sister killed herself. Every year since, but especially the last 3 years, has been a struggle. I've been in public service for many years and for the past three years have been in Iraq. All of my kids are gone and into their own lives over these last three years ... and for their success and enjoyment of/in life I am thankful. But all too often my dreams now are haunted by the death of my sister -- and I dont know why its been so consuming of all my thoughts as of late? Until now I have never spoken to anyone about it. My parents divorced soon after .. and I was alone throughout the years before I left home and went my own way. I guess since then until now I compartmentalized it all .. but for some reason its flooding back now. I feel alone again .. and in trying to understand the reasons for what she did I cant say that I havent had like thoughts. I kept thinking of what the best situation would be that would have the least impact on my kids. If that is even possible? Nothing I've read nor thru my own experiences in life have really helped me. I think I see on one hand that somehow I must never ever consider doing what she did. But I just cant find a reason that my life has anymore real purpose. Perhaps I never really accepted or dealt with, nor struggled with, what my sister left behind. I guess now I find myself asking questions I should have asked a long time ago? -- How could I have not known since we were so close? Why didn't she tell me; why didnt I notice? Why did she do this too me? I find myself longing desparately to connect with someone, but equally I desire to be alone and away from everyone. I think this tug of war is starting to spill over into my work here ... . I sometimes reason that this is due to me having been here in Iraq for so long, and that I just need to go - home? Only, there is no one .. to go too. The last time I was state side it all just seemed so ... unreal. I don't know if I'm a going to make it or not. ........",1
360,"Does it ever get better? I feel like it is all getting too much again. In May I was raped, I went to the Police but they basically in ways not so obvious but in little hints put it down to me being trans* and gay. I thought that would be the hardest bit going through the forensics and the interview (where I had to explain about my gender, my sexuality and my childhood abuse because of what the forensics showed) but whilst waiting to hear if the perp was going to be charged they offered me no support because it could effect the case if it did go to court. I got bounced between mental health services and SARC neither took responsibility to help me. I then as a transman found out I was pregnant, I felt I had no-one to talk to and tried to take my life. I ended up being arrested for my own safety and took to hospital under section, where I deteriorated end up intensive care and only just survived. After the attempt I had to beg a psychiatrist to put me in hospital on my 20th July. They wanted to send me home but after much pleading and discussing many of the ideation thoughts and impulses in my head he agreed to admit me to psychiatric ward. I was released on Thursday after 3 and half months in patient treatment. I am still just as suicidal as when I went in I still want to die. Now not only do I have to deal with the rape, whilst I was in hospital I found out the police NFAed the case, I lost the fetus due to my actions so I effectively killed my child. I just feel like no one gets me, if I tell mental health workers how I feel, they say it is attention seeking if I was serious I would just do it, but when I do just do it they ask why I never asked for help. So now I feel silenced and like I am walking the tightrope alone and at any moment I could fall.",1

362,"son overdosed says it was not suiside attemp Hi I am new here and just looking to see if anyone has any advise.My 14 1/2 year old son overdosed the other night. He said it was a mistake he just took to many pills. I found out from him over a 24 hour period he took 20 perks, 7 viks, 13 xanex and drank tequila. We have a large house and he was treating me like crap so he was in the basement playing video games and I was upstairs and did not really pay attention to what he was up to. I had no idea he had gone around the house and found all the meds we had from previous surgeries for pain and the xanex for my anxiety. I cant believe he almost died and i was mad at him so I was not paying attention. I am trying to digest the whole situation, was he just trying to get really messed up or was he trying to end it. He had been wearing a belt around his neck also said he likes it there it makes him feel comfortable. Anyone have thoughts on this or suggestions how to help him. He is already seeing a psychologist and had just gotten out of a 30 day wilderness RTC.",0
363,"Sick of life and people. So im at a crossroads right now, im 18 male i have a great job , good pay, benifits, the whole deal. I also just moved out on my own 2 months ago. Ive been depressed for a few years, highschool was horrible, i was expelled for drug possesion about half way through my senior year. Finished up at another school though and graduated, but thats not the reason it was horrible, I wasnt bullied or anything, i was just a total loner, completly antisocial. I had 1 friend but he got sick of my pessimistic attitude towards everything and eventually drifted away. My childhood was good, until my parents got divorced, some 5 years ago. And since then shit has gone downhill. Empty, lonely, tired, i know people notice becasue my face looks like death, heavy dark circles under my eyes, i have no emotion when i speak, i have no interests. When I wake up on my days off, i just wallow around my empty apartment all day. Its hard to explain how i feel, it truely is the worst kind of suffering, being isolated. Knowing there are others living, loving, socializing, Its hard to just stand up and go meet people, i wish it was that easy. I know this post wont do anything either, i guess the minor satisfaction of others knowing what im going through is somewhat comforting. Not to be smug, but i envy ""stupid people"" who just look at things the way they want to see them, living blindly in there own little happy world. And they just roll with it. As much as i despise ""sheep"" i sometimes want to be one. I have an addiction, not to drugs, a different type of addiction, a guilty, nasty, pathetic, addiction. One i love and crave, but also despise Im not going to explain though (Yeah its that low and vile). I sometimes wonder if this ""addiction"" is a reflection of my OCD. But what do i know im no psychiatrist. The mysteries of life and death have always facinated me, im not religious (go figure right? He hates the government and is an athiest) Im no liberal either if thats what your all leaning towards right now. But thats beside the point. I was raised catholic, accept god, fear god, love god and you will go to heaven and lead a happy life. Obviously that didnt work out in my favor so therefore i start to denie god. I dont like being looked at as a stupid teenage kid who is a complete ignoramus about the world, when the person making that accusation knows nothing about me or what they are talking about. Why would it matter if im 18 and there 40, knowledge is not obtained by years. Anyways im getting off topic, Why should I keep living like I do? Whats the point of living when you dont FEEL anything? When you dont care if you live or die, will it ever end? The sadness the dark feeling that lurks inside of you day and night? It sounds like a cliche but its painfully true. Im very close to ending it, and frankly I dont see why I shouldnt. Replies would be greatly appreciated",1
364,"A Puzzle I went through my notebook and took the best line or two of each poem I've written, then I put them together to create this letter. This is basicly a puzzle fully assembled. As I read over it my eyes filled with tears and my heart ached so bad, it's just a puzzle but I couldn't say it better . . . I'm fighting a war that I can't fight much more. My eyes can't hold the tears, my mind can't control the fears, and my arms ache for one more hug. You'll never know how broken I am, or why my tears have fallen for so many years. One day soon I will give in. Most will never understand why I chose to die. I try to keep everyone from seeing this broken heart of mine, or the deep emptiness in my once bright eyes. Still time continues to pass, the earth continues to rotate, life and death, good and evil, love and hate as well as peace and war continue. People still laugh and cry, live and die and wonder why. I find myself pacing the floor looking for something I've done before. Looking for something I don't have to think to do. The fog in my mind thickens while the darkness grows darker and I find myself living by the light of the moon. The nights shadows hide my tears. The pain that fills my soul and makes me cry when I'm alone. You'll never find all the pieces of my broken heart, I gave them to God hoping he could fix them while my broken body bleeds itself dry. I can hear the whisper of death calling and I see the dark angels that want to take me away. Please hold me close, hold me tight, hold me all through the night. Hold me so I finally feel what love is. Save me from this place where I'm just waiting to die. Have you ever been lost in some of the most familiar places while the salty tears stain your face? You may see the smiles I show on the outside, but you'll never know how I'm dieing on the inside. What happened to the innocent child, the little one so very meek and mild? If you took the bricks from your wall and climbed back up from that painful fall, if you were able to reach beyond your fears, would that child of innocence still be? Would he be building castles in the sand? Would he still smile back at me? Tis' just a dream, this I know, back in time we can never go. I've had these deep dark dreams buried in my mind but living in my heart. One day nothing will be as it seems and the long awaited silence will start. I'll simply fade into a peaceful sleep and nobody will have the slightest clue why, silently, I begin to weep. My pain relief is so long overdue. Is your world always shadowed by a deep sadness? Do you long for some type of human touch? I wish I knew how to ask for what I need, the natural human touch we all need. Would you hold my hand and teach me how to hug? I wish I could hold back the tears just long enough to expose the broken hearted child in me. Do you hear the soft whispers that haunt the silence of the night or the music nobody else seems to hear? Do you know how to ease the pain of a broken heart? I know my death is coming soon. I'm falling into a dark hole that does not exist. All of my sand castles have blown away in the wind. There's an emptiness in the air, an emptiness that I can feel. Somebody is missing here, somebody has gone away. Their dieing of a broken heart, their dieing scared and alone. Nobody knows the pain they try to hide, and nobody knows this Somebody is me. The days are too long and the nights are too short, I'm caught in a life I wish I could abort. Nobody has realized that it's my tears . . . not the rain. Nobody knows of the nightmares that haunt my mind, nobody could possibly know such fears of this kind. Nobody knows that I'm broken and dieing inside. Take this life of mine, take it far away. Take the air from my lungs, take the blood from my heart. Take the pain inside of me, take it all away. Save me from this place where I'm just waiting to die. I can't stop the loneliness that drives me insane or ease the never ending pain. My heart beats hard, fear and panic fills my trembling body. The fear and emptiness that is so indefinably real. My broken heart is flooded with tears, can a person forget how to cry? I'm carrying an ache I need somebody else to feel, to help me understand. Nightmares are stuck in my head. I can't stop thinking, reliving these things, the things that hurt so much. The only way to stop these memories is to stop my brain. I'm sorry that I could not spend more time with you. But the day has come, the oxygen no longer flows, my heart no longer beats, my body no longer grows, my tongue no longer speaks. I'm ready to simply let go. My tears have never really dried but death will dry them, I know . . . Now my heart is forever still and I'm at peace - that can't be wrong.",1

367,"It can always get worse A little while ago I struggled with severe depression and thoughts of suicide. Had planned out a fool proof way so I wouldn't fail and end up severely crippled. Came close many times. Dad had died, dog I had since I was a teen who was one of my two best friends in the whole world passed away, wife who was my other best friend divorced me unexpectantly and a series of other things went seriously wrong. My best friend drifted away and I had no other close friends left. Only thing that stopped me each time was I still had a very good although stressful job that paid extremely. Thought at least that's something which I could also use to get some help and try again to make a last attempt to turn my life around. Then I got laid off unexpectantly (never lost a job in my life before) with a deep recession and no other jobs available in my area. Now I am also unemployed, have no money and might lose my house on top of everything else that I was depressed about. Prior to the job loss I would have been positive that this would have pushed me over. Some how I'm still here. I came to an important realization though. No matter how bad things seem they can always get much worse. Best to enjoy what you have now. For about 5 years things in my life kept getting worse and I always kept looking back thinking how good I had it five years ago, two years ago, one year and even six months in the past. Thinking what I wouldn't give to go back to where I was back then when at the time I was also depressed and also thinking what I wouldn't give to go back to better times. For some reason now and recently whether it be that I am in the eye of the storm or that thought that I had better savour today because it can always get much worse tommorow I feel calm and ok. Part of me thinks so what if everything I cared about is now gone. Life is a journey and the past was just one part of the experience with the future being another chapter in the journey of life to get to experience. I really hope that this is not just the eye of the storm.",1
368,"Done and Dusted - ready to go I am truly done and dusted now. Let me start with a short history of myself. I have been diagnosed with manic depression since 18 , I m 38 now , been on all sorts of medicine, only helps temporarily. Seen countless psychiatrists to no avail. I was brought up in a well to do family, my dad died of a heart attack when i was a kid, I grew up being a spoiled brat as my dad has left a fair amount of money behind. I trained as a lawyer and at the height of my professional career, I made quite a bit of money. I started partying to no end and became an alcoholic and was dismissed from my job last year. i am tied in a very unhappy marriage , though my wife is very supportive , I never feel connected to her.

370,Depression or suicide???? I haven't decided where the best place is to place this post. I know not to make it too long otherwise people won't read it. But I'm feeling low and not good tonight and I'm not sure if i'm at risk or not. So hence the title of the message.

373,"Descending I'm a 20 year old male. Over the past 9 years I've struggled with consistent severe depression and suicidal feelings. There has always been and always is within me a strong feeling that something is bubbling under, that I'm on the brink of getting too sick of it all and doing away with myself. Most of the time, I conceal these feelings and behave relatively normally, except for the occassional glance into nothingness as I drift off into dark thoughts without checking myself. Sometimes the sadness grows so overwhelming that every moment becomes an agonising struggle in which I feel I must decide whether to ""do it"" or ""not do it"". Many times I've been on the brink of suicide for days, weeks, months. I've destroyed everything I own with a hammer countless times, including expensive valuables, and even when I've done it before and regretted it I've done it all over again. I've lay catatonic in bed for weeks, not washing, barely eating, leaving my teeth to rot, not even looking out of my bedroom window. In my depression I've shattered the few friendships I've had, and those I did not shatter withered away out of my lack of enthusiasm for other human beings. I've had educational opportunities but I quickly lose enthusiasm for them and ultimately fail despite having ability. I do not live a hopeless existence. I was just recently given an unconditional offer to attend one of the world's best universities purely on the basis of my talent despite having next to no qualifications. I am in good overall physical health. I'm OK looking, and have been told many times that I have ""swagger"" and ""charisma"", though I know full well that it's a pretense, the only way I know of to hide my misery from other people. A few times I've dropped all pretenses and been frank about who I am and what I feel - that hasn't worked out so well. I've come to learn that people prefer the charade, even those who claim to love me. Anyway, my point is, I know full well that I am priveleged, compared to many. What disturbs me is that I simply don't care, because I have no enthusiasm for life. I have interests and hobbies, but they are hardly worth living for. I know people, but they, too, are not worth living for. If I could, I would forget about forming attachments, forget about enthusiasm for anything and just drift along through life in my indifference, but alas, I cannot do that. I feel too heavily burdened, for I am always weighed down by guilt, regret and doubt. I can never recover from the past. For example, I lost my only real friend over two years ago after an argument and it still torments me every day. Nor can I ever look forward to the future, because it is my natural tendency to expect history to repeat itself and for the same misfortunes to recur in my life. I feel that I am destined to be unhappy regardless of what fortunes befall me. Ultimately I see no reason to continue. I am not mentally ill and have no personality disorder, so I have no interest in seeking medical ""treatment"" and no delusion that said ""treatment"" will lead to any kind of improvement. I recognise that my unhappiness is directly connected to my core personality traits. Truth be told, I don't know why I'm posting this... I guess I just want to see what people have to say.

I can't have a real relationship with a guy because I'm too scared after being raped last year. My job prospects aren't good because my grades are mediocre. Nothing is fun to me anymore... Fear of possible consequences is the only thing holding me back from killing myself right now. I want to be absolutely sure that this is the right course of action before I finalize my plans. Is there any reason at all that I should live? What hope is there? I'm having a hard time finding any.,1
375,"My Introductory Post I'm in my early 20s. Since my mid-teens I've suffered depression, general anxiety, and social anxiety. I find it very difficult to function on a daily basis, and so pursuing a career in anything I'm really interesting in seems like a far-off dream. As such, I work part time doing factory work, dreaming of what I would really like to be doing. My childhood has been full of neglect and emotional and physical abuse. I speak to both parents (who are divorced), but feel a lot of hurt from the past, and don't feel I can talk to them about any real issues. I am quite intelligent in a lot of ways, but emotionally I feel like I'm still a child, as though I was never taught how to adjust to adult responsibilities. I've been on Zoloft in the past and now take Effexor. Neither have been much help. I have substance abuse issues and am probably an alcoholic. Last week I was drinking with a friend. He had no money and I spent the last of mine at the pub with him. The last thing I recall was dancing with an elderly woman to some blues music, then I blacked out. When I sobered up I was walking the streets with a dollar in my pocket, and my bag from college lost somewhere. It was freezing cold, one of the coldest nights in some time here. I spotted a garage door that was slightly open, so I let myself in and slept in a stranger's laundry. I woke up in the morning and left before they found me. There's been many times when I've woken up on footpaths or gutters. My mother was recently diagnosed with lung cancer, which is quite serious. Her chances are relatively slim. I had sex at a very early age, and have had many sexual encounters since, but have never had a proper relationship. My best friend is twice my age, and in many ways he's more like my father than my real dad. His kids have become like my own brothers and sisters and I love them very much. However, my friend has a family to look after, so the support he can offer me is limited. He is also very religious and I'm not. Often when I discuss my problems with him, he tells me that he was very similar at my age, and the only thing that got him through such problems was God. That sort of thing only makes me feel worse, like there is little hope for me. I see a psychologist sometimes, but I don't feel like I am making much progress beyond just being able to have someone else to talk to. I feel a great deal of distress and anguish on a daily basis. I often feel like no one really understands the extend of what I'm dealing with, and that it would take something drastic like a suicide attempt to make them understand. I don't really want to die, but I often fantasise about attempting suicide, and maybe finally being able to get the help I need as a consequence. I realise this seems selfish and attention-seeking, but I really feel like no one takes me seriously. Often the only thing that stops me is the idea of living with organ damage, and the thought of how my family would cope if I were to actually die. I also have problems with self-harm (cutting). My mother often tells me I should move in with her, that the change of scene will do me good, as if it were that simple. (In actuality, moving in with her would probably be a terrible move, due to her levels of stress and emotional instability.) That's pretty much it, where I'm at right now. These are just some of my problems, other things I can only discuss with my friend and counsellor due to their nature.",1
376,"Cant take this any more... been a while since iv posted here..... any ways.. i just cant take life any more i just cant, christmas time is always hard for me because in 1996 on christmas eve my dad comitited suicide, he hung him self in the bath room. i think about suicide every day, i am in pain every day, at work one of my managers is being a real dick and i am dreading working the rush hour because i have high anxiety. my anxiety is so bad i stopped going to school last year and im only 14 i cant deal with things i was getting picked on, no one would listen to me i was a lone. i still am alone i just dont see the point in living when every day i am in pain every day i dread what the world will bring me every day i cry i think about how i will end my life. i get so close to cutting my veins in my wrist then i remember my mum saying she loves me and i just cry..... i just cant take this any more! i am a failure why should i continue living when i am in pain i am dreading every thing in life. i dont know why i posted here i just wanted to know im not alone i guess.......",1
377,"One Girl Could Ruin It All I feel awful. On the 10th, this girl in my emotional support classroom tried to hit me. And ever since then, things have been spiraling out of control. I was doing so well not thinking about suicide for the past couples months and was almost 2 months clean from self-harm. And then after that... well that weekend, my friend's sister was so rude and mean to me... and then on this past Tuesday I self-harmed, twice. And then Wednesday morning, I self-harmed again. I'm such a failure. And I haven't been able to stop thinking about killing myself since that Friday. The cruel jerks rule this world, why would I want to stay? It's been 4 years since this all began and here I am, still wanting to die. When will it get better? Never. It will never change for me.",1

379,"The Dark Place Well Ive been in a pretty dark place lately, been testing the waters on the couple people I have left that I think might still give a shit and they both failed. Some people call this this a cry for help, but I'm way beyond that. The only reason i haven't killed myself to date is because I thought my two friends gave a shit, that literally has been keeping me alive the last ten years. I have grown spiteful at them, almost as if it's their fault I'm here suffering. So not knowingly at first, I started pushing them away, which was surprisingly easy. Recently I have been getting worse, more depressed, drinking more, thinking about killing myself a lot more frequently, now multiple times a day, sometimes all day until I pass out. I was hoping my last couple friends would pony up and make my being here worth it, but they still believe i'm being weak or acting like a cry baby. On top of all the other crap it makes me want to kill myself just to show them Ive been serious all this time, which i know is a crazy thing to say but I suppose I'm a little tapped at this point. Pretty much close to the end of my rope, not much fight left, in fact i don't care to try anymore.",1
380,"Guys I'm too depressed Overburdened with stuff and I can't do it. I just can't do it. I was doing so well too. I have not had such a bad day in a while. ""It'll go away.."" NO IT WONT. I have to go get several root canals. I ahve to go to school don't I? I have do study for finals and I woke up depressed and I still am. I have 0 confidence and faith in myself. I hate this. I CANT DO IT. Life is so dark and depressing. How did this happen? I was perfectly fine yesterday and then BAM. I didn't even follow my plan today. Fck. Plus I think I'm being taken over by paranoia along with depression. I feel like my teeth are falling out. They are not but i feel like they are. what do i do? what is somethings wrong. I cannot live with no teeth. or my front teeth missing. idont even want to go thru the shame of having to get 3 root canals at 16. who the hell needs root canals that young? i feel like my teeth are falling out. i can feel it happening.... i just want to lie down and cry. and let it all out. but i cant. b/c i fcking share a room with my dad. i HATe my life. no one loves me and that thing is happening a gain.",1
381,"struggling, anyone want to help? If I happen to pass away soon whether it is a natural death or a suicidal death, I want people, especially my family, to know a few things. First this wasn’t caused by any single person. This is not because I’m getting bullied or because of other people. This is because I am not happy with the world or the thought of life. I just can’t stand people and their changes. I wish people could just stay the same way all the time, but that’s life and they can’t and that is why I’m not happy with a lot lately. Sure people say that I have a lot going for me, but I’m not thinking into the future and that’s my problem, how can I look into the future when I’m never happy with the current times? That’s just a calling for a problem to occur. For the past few months now, no matter what help I get, I just can’t and won’t be happy anymore. I’ve dug myself a deep hole and I realize that but I just can’t get out of it. It’s not on my list of priories right now and I would love to find a way to change things, but I can’t find the right help. I’m getting sick of the everyday depression I get, and I thought it was normal at first, but after time went on I can just see that it’s not normal at all and that I have a problem. Anyone with help I would love to hear it, Thanks a lot world. Talk to you later.",1
382,"On My Mind... Everyday I wake up, every night before I go to bed, leaving this planet is always on my mind. It's a hard thought to deal with. Very overwhelming. It's easy for me to picture my deaths in many ways. Sometimes I get lost in the visions and the thoughts, and it gives me a sense of security (oddly enough). The thing that bothers me the most about it, is how taboo it is. We are always told we have choices in life. But if someone chooses suicide, they are thought of as selfish, coward, weak. Not to mention the implications on family and close friends. That is the only thing that stops me. The thing is, I am not afraid of death. I believe everyone has a soul that moves on (maybe reincarnation?) to another place, like a different dimension or something. Everyone tells me I am so young (in my 20's) and I shouldn't be feeling this way. This pisses me off even more. They are trying to put a label as to what I ""should"" be, but I am not. I always feel like I want to run away from something. My fight/flight instincts are always in gear, and it's very tiring. I know life is what you make it, but sometimes life has different plans than what you thought... and life loves throwing out surprises. I just don't know if I want to continue dealing with this. It's not normal. I have a yearning to ""go back"". Back where? Off this planet... but I dunno. This place is dirty and filthy. I don't see the point to it anymore. I'll stop rambling. Thanks for reading.",1

384,"lost today I'm trying not to get swallowed back into full blown depression, but its hard. I was trying to avoid thinking, my thought process was if I didn't think at all, than the thoughts wouldn't be negative and I would somehow fight off the depression thats always waiting to pounce. I don't know why I'm posting, nothing changes and everything needs to change to get any better. This seems so difficult for me, sometimes I feel like it will never happen. I'm trying to not let my head lead more than my heart, my heart feels as though its trapped and there's no way out for someone like me. No way to find light and happiness, no possible way to make things better. I know there's no logic in life, no reason for something good or bad to happen...and it tires me out a bit. Anyway I know the whole thing, think positive etc and things will get better. Of course it has to, just continually trying will eventually turn something good, something in your favour. I always promised myself that I would kill myself at 32 and I haven't and that's kind of depressing. Now I'm promising myself I'll kill myself in a year, give my all and if nothing changes for the better, kill myself. I know these aren't happy thoughts but I think its the right thoughts for me. I've been having a hard time lately and it looks like it will only get worse. Will I ride out the bad times? yeah for another year at least. My brother is beautiful, very flawed by such a great guy but I won't talk to him anymore about my feelings. They are so repetitious and exhausting, how could they not be exhausting for him too? Don't get me wrong I am going to try to fight but I won't fight forever, I refuse too.",1

I always make shit decisions in life & I end up getting hurt so badly. There must be something wrong with me. I'm so pathetic it's actually embarrassing. I've been planning to move abroad to make a new start but now I think it would be easier for a lot of people if I was dead. I'd have to pack all my stuff up first though as it wouldn't be fair for someone to have to gather all my belongings. I wish I had the guts to do this tonight. I'm too pathetic to try. My only hesitation is my mum as I don't want to hurt her but I can't go on like this. My life is so shit & no one knows how much I am struggling, people think I should just cheer up & go out more. I can't. I can't eat properly either, I've lost nearly 2 stone as I have no appetite. I can't sleep so I went to the drs & the gave me 3 weeks of zopiclone which helped, but I've just taken my last one, so tomorrow I'll be screwed as they said they won't give me anymore.

390,"Passive Suicidal Ideation haunts me Constant thoughts of suicide follow me thru every day --even when things seem to be going ok. Nothing is permanent or long lasting for me. I've learned not to expect much -of life or myself. I don't deserve anything better. All I deserve is to be gone from this life. I have felt this way for so many years and I can only hope that one day I will be brave enough to carry through. I'm tired. Tired of the thoughts of suicide telling me that I have long overstayed my welcome on earth...that things for me will never improve...I will never see true and long lasting happiness....will always be an outsider....screw up everything I touch. I want this to end, but unfortunately the haunting is only passive and continues to taunt me every morning I wake up. Sleeping is my best friend -it provides an escape from myself and my existence. Oh, how I wish this was over and I was gone from this earth. I want the pain and the thoughts to stop. Drink a caustic fluid? possibly...Walk the railroad tracks into a passing train? possibly....Purchase a gun? possibly....Razor blades? possibly....These are thoughts that haunt me every day.

Anxiety has caused me to suffer from severe insomnia. The only good thing that has ever happened to me is my girlfriend. She's the only reason I haven't killed myself already.

401,"It gets scariest... ...when I stop crying. ...when I stop feeling anything exaggerated ...when I stop feeling ...when I stop clinging ...when I'm perfectly calm. It's those times when I'm completely out of the strength to keep on holding on to the last rung of the ladder that I'm the most afraid for my life. I don't really want to let go, but I *cannot* try any more. Life hasn't worked so far and I'm out of the gas required to keep on going to see what's over the next hill. I've tried twice. I'm not there tonight - my tank of denial has some fumes and I've got my rose colored glasses on - but they're wearing on me and I can see the long road past them anyway. *taps at fuel gauge* Nothing is terrible. I have a fantastic job. Romance has had the normal ups and downs. Family & Friends are awesome people. But I can't make myself function as part of society; I genuinely don't know how without faking it and it takes *so* much energy and only works for a few hours at a time. Everyone who knows me knows a character I made up and make up every day so that I don't stumble out into the world like an alien. The character forgets its lines sometimes, though. Or smiles when there should be tears. Most people smell something off about it and just don't accept it at all - no matter what it looks like or what it says. I'll always be peering in the window from the cold outside looking in. And if I'm always going to be on the outside - and I'm old enough and experienced enough to strongly believe I will - then I just don't know what to do. I only get joy from friendships, family, and loves. The rest is just passing the time. I'm very, very tired and the spinning panic comes more and more frequently. My life will end with a shrug, I think, after the panic is done and I can't...anything...any more. I'm terrified of the stillness. Hi, I'm new here. :/",1

Is it similar to suicide? My life has ""felt"" different ever since September of last year. I guess the catalyst for the change was a relapse in CFS/ME. This chronic condition has taken away some more ""living"" for me. Less energy, less focus, less ambition; more pain, more fatigue, more brain fog. It has impacted my work, my social life (not that I was a big social butterfly before), and my marriage. So now it's been 6 1/2 months of living a less engaged or active life ... and I find myself thinking about death and dying a lot. At least every day. I am not making any plans, I am not acquiring any means/methods, I am not finishing up any loose ends, and I am not actively working through any bucket list. But I have this strong sense of apathy - you know that inner ""meh"" you feel whenever you think, I should do the laundry/call a friend/start a new painting/ or anything that speaks of vitality or interest or meaning. And today that apathy or pointlessness is really strong. It's as if I don't really care about being alive anymore. I feel bored and unmotivated ... I go through the paces, go to work, keep the house liveably clean, wash the dirty underwear, take out the trash - you know all those menial boring daily duties that right now seem so stupid and ridiculous. As if any of it really matters! (Well, I guess having clean underwear matters to those near me.) I guess it's the depression - combined with the illness/being unwell. Yeah it is. I'm feeling depressed about being in pain, tired, and foggy. It's making me feel less connected to aliveness. Maybe I should've posted this in ""Venting"". I'm okay - I'm not at the edge or anything. Just a really really flat mood that makes me think death is not such a bad thing. What stops me though is my spiritual beliefs - and I want to stress spiritual, not religious. Somewhere deep down inside me, there is this stubborn voice that keeps telling me that I was given this sacred gift of Life and to throw it away would be very disrespectful to what I call Kitchi Manitou, or Great Spirit. And it would violate this inner value of cherishing the sacredness of life. I do - I value all of life. Especially the children. These little people also keep me wanting to stay alive, even if it's to give them one more hug or one more word of encouragement. That's really what is keeping me going right now. But I'm merely existing, not living. I guess that's okay, isn't it? Coasting for a while? But I really really miss moving myself - ""swimming"" if you want to look at it metaphorically. As in, propelling myself with intent and purpose and hope and courage. So maybe I should've posted this in ""Grieving"". Sorry everyone for my meandering! But this is therapeutic ... so thank you if you read this, and if you have something to say about this TTL topic. I hope you all keep safe and stay alive tonight. Cuz there's be an empty space in the world without you, and that would be really sad.",1

406,"I just don't know. I've been reading about for over an hour and I feel a bit strange. Most of what I've stumbled upon speaks of childhood, so far a way. And yet I'm sitting here, just turned 14. I know that many of you would say, you're just 14, how could you know true pain? But this is only getting worse. And I urge you to remember that pain is relative. I've taken ten arrows, and you've taken 100, but what only hurts you a little brings me to my knees. Until recently self-harm has seemed like a sort of thing we talk about in health class, but the other day that changed. Two weeks ago life hit me like a train, and out of distress I took a near by letter opener and slashed me wrist. It wasn't much and I thought of it as a fluke. Then the next day at school, just as the pain had subsided, I realized I wasn't bothered by the pain. In fact it felt... strangely comforting. By that Wednesday I found myself hungry for that feeling, more so than for food. That Thursday I came home in tears and found a blade a blade I used to use to carve wood, now I use to carve into my arm. Suddenly this far off story, was my truth. The problem is, I don't want it to be that way. When I was little I used to think of offing myself, I had nerve back then. But now I've realized I don't have the nerve for that. That said I still have moments like this : Some random person : ""Years from now you'll look onto this moment and spend the rest of your life treasuring this."" My mind : ` not hard to believe if my life is almost over. ` But the truth is there are a few people in my life I know I'd hurt, and somehow, that makes me unable to even think further than that empty wish. What I'm scared of is that this is only the beginning. But I'm to scared to look for the end.",1
407,"I think about ending my life... ...but then there would be nothing left. It's not like I'd become an angel and go up to heaven. It's not like I'd reincarnate and live a better life. We have only one life and that's it. Also it's good to remember that things change. People change. I might be destined to be severely depressed this year, but next year I might be destined to come out of it. The point is that we never know when and how things will improve. Life is like that.",0
408,"I rationally believe that ending my life is my only option. Excuse me for posting this so soon. I have been reading through the forum, but find no words of my own to offer to others yet. I have been wanting to kill myself daily for over two years, and I have many good reasons to do so. It's is a long story, and ultimately all my fault and proof that I am a lowly human being who is not worth being in anyone's life. From age 18 to 28, I was involved in building a fantastic arts scene in my community. By the age of 28 I had it all, I was ecstatic and on top of the world. I had the best friends anyone could ever want and the opportunity to be an artist. Of course the art scene is heavy into drinking, as was I at the time. We were all functional alcoholics. My husband of less than two years had been going through a year-long training session through work. We worked opposite schedules and would only see each other for an hour here or there throughout the week, usually at 2am when he'd meet me at the bar. I became close with a much older veteran artist. We'd been friends for 7 years. He fell in love with me and pursued me like mad. I did something I never dreamed I would do. I was black out drunk, common for me sadly, and slept with him. I felt so confused by the whole ordeal I told myself that must have been my choice and what I wanted, and I did it once more intentionally. Then I called it off. Then everyone found out. My husband reignited his own affair that I thought had ended once we were married. Then he left me. He left me in a house I couldn't afford, and on the day I moved into a guest house he said he'd changed his mind. I was hated by most of the arts community. Very hated. Banned from theaters. This older man was not. Life was hard for a year, but I still had some of my closest friends. Then my husband left me again. I decided I needed to leave the state. I sold everything I owned and moved in with a friend who said she had a great house she'd just bought. We drove for three days to a house with no AC or heat, no hot water, and an illegal addition that electrocuted us if we touched the window sills. It was also in a horrifying neighborhood. We both drank as soon as we woke up daily and talked openly about suicide. I knew that situation was going to kill me, so I went back home after three weeks, and she never spoke to me again. She was one of my closest friends. I moved in with my best friend. I was drinking like crazy, talking openly about depression. I had been seeing my therapist and psychiatrist regularly. One night I was so sick of feeling homeless, and so ashamed of binge drinking that I checked into a hotel. All I had with me was what I'd purchased at the grocery store. Alcohol. I'd only intended to drink. I was given a room at random, however it happened to be the room that my friend's stepfather killed himself in five years earlier. I texted him this and drunkenly asked if it was a sign. He called the cops. The cops came, I was fine, though drunk. My friend who I'd been staying with and his girlfriend came. She had me involuntarily hospitalized and said i was trying to kill myself. In order to have the petition go through there were also several false accusations. The petition said I had an illegal amount of a controlled substance and that I was refusing any professional help. It painted me to be a homeless drug addict, so I was put into a holding room for 27 hours with 80 - 100 unrestrained homeless drug addicts. Many were violent. I was attacked three times, twice sexually. I was then transfered to a state run facility and met with a lawyer. I was able to read the petition for the first time and point out the falsities. They were easy to prove. They just talked to my doctors. This happened on a friday of course, so i stayed until late monday, but the whole thing was dropped due to, ""filing a false petition."" So the county didn't pay for it. I owe $15,000. None of those friends have ever spoken to me again. It has been 12 months. That was a lot. Honestly it sounds absurd and made up. There are so many other things that have happened in the year since the hospital as well, but ultimately the affair and the petition are the reasons I have lost everything. Well not everything, my husband took me back, again. Though I believe he will only leave me. This year I quit drinking. I was devastated to find it had no affect on my mood, though I am quite surprised at how much money I saved. I have a great job. I simply lost everything I'd worked ten years for and all of my friendships. I know it sounds selfish compared to horrible lives some people lead, but it was my life, and i can't handle it being gone. This city is too small to try and rebuild anything. All I do is wake up and wish I was dead. Every day. I am exhausted by this. I have seen therapists. I have been on and off medications. Nothing even makes a dent. I feel like I have already died. I am not the artist I once was, I have no opportunity to be again, as I have been ostracized by what seems like the whole city. I have no friends. I have nothing worth continuing for. All I have is the constant proof that I am not someone that people consider worthy to be in their lives. I am a whore. A worthless whore. Thank you for reading. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to continue.",1

413,"I see a lot of people here... seem to be getting some sort of help from doctors etc. but telling anybody else how I feel truly feel terrifies me. It was hard enough to tell one person how I was feeling and even then I couldn't tell them everything. Have doctors etc. really helped you? I've read some things on some other forums that makes me scared of telling anybody I can't truly trust. To be honest I don't want to tell anybody how I'm feeling but I've been told that I should. I suppose that why I'm here posting this now. I will try to explain how I've been feeling: I feel like there's no point any more, due to feeling the way I do I've screwed up everything and that's just made me feel even worse. I've actually cut myself on two separate occasions; the first time was pretty bad tbh I won't go into detail, the second time wasn't as bad because I managed to stop myself. I sometimes get the feeling that no one really cares about me and the fact that nobody picked up and how low I was/am feeling just seems to backup that claim. I seem to sleep a lot nowadays and when I wake up I often feel like there's no point in geeting up and just stay in bed. For example On Tuesday night\ Wednesday morning I went to bed around 1am and didn't get up to 4:30pm. I then went down had something to eat and just seemed really tired so I went back bed around 5:30pm. I then got back up at 7pm and stayed up until 11:30pm I the slept until around 2pm the next day. I have been for some walks recently but they seem to be getting harder and harder. Today for example I walked for 20 minutes before sitting down on a park bench and I just sat there for about a hour, I just didn't want to get up. My whole body seems to get very heavy especially my legs. I know it may sound clichéd but i just feel very numb a lot of the time. Also I'm becoming very intolerant of people going on about stupid pointless things. I've managed to to keep my anger under control by just walking away, but I know if they keep on at me I'm just going to lose it one of these days. I also cry everyday, I just can't help it. Last Saturday is closest that I've come to truly committing suicide I even wrote a letter and everything, but instead I ended up telling somebody how I was feeling. I still don't see any point in carrying on with this life though. It just seems pointless and I don't see anything getting better.",1

I can't help people anymore, the harder I try the more I fail. I get too emotionally involved and how the hell does that explain me feeling numb? Emotionally involved=no emotion? I'm so numb and want so badly to shed a tear but I can't. And it hurts, it hurts on the inside so much and I just can't handle it anymore. I get myself through each day and think the next one's going to be better but IT'S NOT ANY BETTER it's always WORSE! I can't handle the emptiness inside, I'm going downhill and I've been saying this to people but it doesn't help to bring me back up again. I'm starting to think I'll never feel better. I try to take my mind off things by helping others but I don't help them, I make it worse for them. I go to great lengths to help and get kicked in the face and I can't handle that. There's no way out of this. I don't even know who I am anymore, I can't find myself or my place in life and this really sucks!! I go from feeling fine, getting things doen, to nothing but a complete emotionally numb mess and each time it gets worse and worse and how much worse is it going to get.

My only hesitation is my mum as I don't want to hurt her but I can't go on like this. My life is so shit & no one knows how much I am struggling, people think I should just cheer up & go out more. I can't. I can't eat properly either, I've lost nearly 2 stone as I have no appetite. I can't sleep so I went to the drs & the gave me 3 weeks of zopiclone which helped, but I've just taken my last one, so tomorrow I'll be screwed as they said they won't give me anymore.

420,"Don't understand how people can be like this Hi all. First time posting here. I think the only thing stopping me from throwing in the towel are my niece and nephews. I don't want them to suffer from me not being around. I help a lot with the kids, both physically and emotionally and we love being around each other, so that seems to be the only thing holding me back. On the other hand, I'm so tired of thinking. I can't do this anymore. I wish there was a pill one could take to stop thinking altogether. There's only one way I can think of to stop thinking, and I'm well on my way to taking the leap. I've been thinking about all the different ways I can do it so that it has the less possible impact on my family. I can't live with the fact that people are fake and say things just for the sake of saying it. Recently I met this woman and got very interested in her. We started getting to know each other and eventually we were telling each other things and saying things to each other that people in relationships would say. Things like I miss you, you are special to me, we have a special bond, I love how you make me feel. Then out of the blue it stops. Now we are reduced down to 1 message a day if I'm lucky. I believe she said all of those things to get me to like her and when she realised I did like her and she was liking me just as much back, she cut it off. So I don't understand. Why say things to another human being and then stop saying them? It makes me feel like I've been played and I hate that because I don't do that. How can someone do that? I've lost all hope in humanity. The only way I can think of to not trust anyone again is to just not be around for it to happen. So for now I'll keep thinking of ways to do it.

From this place of inner peace, I have a vision that affirms peace in the world. I envision a world in which spiritual seekers are nourished with divine strength. Conflicted souls learn to forgive through God's compassionate presence. Hurting hearts are healed through God's love. I envision a world in which those who once despaired have hope and where love enfolds us all. All human beings are experiencing and expressing inner peace. From deep within, I claim an indescribable inner peace that is mine to bask in and to share. As I send my peaceful thoughts out into the world, I envision peace reflected back to me from people near and far God means different things to different people I consider myself a spiritual being having a human experience.

He texted me and said he was too busy doing laundry and definitely couldn't be bothered to drive 10 minutes to my house. Then he started ignoring my texts/calls. This made me feel so much worse. Is there even any reason to stay alive if you're miserable, in physical pain all the time, and there's no one who would grieve for you? I would leave all my money to charity so wouldn't it be better for everyone if I just ended it? The money I left behind might be used to save lives that are more valuable than mine.

Im about to end my life... i had been thinking several times for more than a week now and i guess ill do it. i grew up in a broken family, my mom abandoned me when i was born since she wanted fo fullfil her dreams. my paternal grandparents too care of me. at the age of 3 my mom went back and stole me from them, she went to singapore but she left with her aunt, with her promised to give a monthly allowance, after my mom left, she never called nor contacted my grandma. my grandma is good to me sometimes, but her daughters are not, at age of 7 i used to clean the house, wash the dishes and i became thier running errand. when i was in 6th grade my grandma cant no longer take care of me since she already lost her job, she turned me over to my uncle ( mom's brother ) . that was the time that i had a chance to met my mom ( over the phone ) she already lived in Canada. i stayed at my uncle's house while my mom sends money for my allowance, my uncle is nice but her wife is not, i never felt i was part of the family, even my mom sends money, she still makes me feel that im just an additional mouth to feed. i graduated high school, it was also the time that my grandfather died. my mom went back to show her last respect, it was my first time to see her. i was so excited, so happy and all. but she made me feel that i am not her daughter anymore. she told me to look for my father and asked assistance so i can go to college, she told me that she never declared me as her daugher in Canada so it is impossible for her to bring me there, plus her new husband doesnt know everything about me. My uncle and his wife told me to look for my father since my mom cant no longer send money for me. i was able to find my father's family, but he already has his own family and his mother in law doesnt know anything about me , so i cant stay with them. i have no place to live, been sleeping in church, streets , waiting shed. ive done so many things so i would be able to afford to eat and have shelter. i worked and study at the same time, finished college. i met a guy whom i thought will be the answer to my prayers so i can have a family of my own. i got pregnant, he is jobless so i work for us and for his family. after 5 years i found out he is having an affair with our neighbor. i left and bring my child with me. i struggled a lot, working , being a mom, i have to leave my 5 year old kid alone so i can work, my salary is not enough for all our expenses. i recently met a guy, he made me feel so special, so happy, he asked me to stop working because he promised he will come here in my country to see me. i resigned, i depend on him, i always try to tell him let me work because he keeps on saying he is coming next month but its been almost a year but he never been here. he disappeared . my life seems fall down, i depend on him too much, i loved him so much, he disappeared without saying a word. been trying to contact him but he never answered. im getting tired of being temporarily being happy, everything i hoped for, just a simple love i cant have it. yes i am now struggling with financial issuses and emotional issues. what makes me more weak is because of my child, school year is about to start but i cant do anything. if i die.. im sure his father will start to do somethibg for him.",1
431,"I am a horrible person for doing what I really didn't want to do!!! Don't read this if you supported Trump, but ever since this troll, bully, and criminal of a candidate got elected, I just lost all faith in humanity in the most extreme and permanent of ways. Not even a scientist finding a cure for cancer would restore my faith in humanity. I had more faith in DIRT than humanity. My biggest fear with Trump would be that he would turn America into the Western Hemisphere's North Korea, a terrible dictatorship where you couldn't do anything you want, and you had to do what you're told to do or else you would risk death. But here's the biggest thing: What my parents told me I was doing was pulling a Trump myself! They said the biggest reason people voted for Trump was that they were scared and angry. And I completely fit the criteria, despite me not voting for him in the first place! I was scared for what Trump would do to our country, and I was so angry to blame the entire human race for being so stupid to elect a troll! They even said that Trump would go to prison if he attempted to turn America into a dictatorship! I am such a horrible person for becoming a Donald Trump myself and I deserve to die!",0
432,"Disaster After Disaster I'm unmedicated bipolar. I've been without insurance or funds for 8 months now. I was ok for awhile, and I had hoped I'd swing to the other end of the spectrum but no such luck. I've been depressed for months. It just gets worse and worse. In the last week my husband became totally fed up with my depression and the fact that I can barely get out of bed, and he packed up his car and left. Of course he left us with little food in the house and cut off notices on all the utilities, but that's apparently of no concern to him as he's gone back to live with his mother. He's 48. When he stays there they pay all his bills and provide his shelter and food. I had to send my 17 year old son to live with his father. He's bipolar as well. He refused to be medicated and proceeded to punch holes in the walls and terrorize his siblings. We have had him hospitalized on several occasions, he's been in rehab 4 times and juvie countless times. We moved half way across the country to get him away from his friends so he could have a fresh start. Nothing works. I originally went off my meds so I could afford his. I didn't realize he'd been flushing them or I wouldn't have discontinued mine. Now I can't find any programs in this area to help me get back on my meds. and I feel like I've abandoned him, but there are 3 other kids in the house and he was hiding knives in his room. His father has promised he would be taken care of. My 22 year old daughter that is in school in a different part of the country called me over the weekend and told me she had been referred to an oncologist. They found another lump in her breast, this time very near her lymph node. My kids started school yesterday with no school clothes and no supplies. Right now I just feel lucky that I can still feed them. I spent the morning researching rescues for my dogs. I should have sent the kids with their dad. I can't take care of them. I have neither the financial nor emotional resources to handle the kids. This depression is different than most I've had, and I've had many. This time I'm not crying or sad. I'm flat. Cold. I know I love my kids, but I can't feel it. I can't feel anything but the desperate need to escape. I'm backed into a corner with no way out. There is absolutely no way I can catch up the bills. Within two weeks I'll have lost everything. I have grown daughters and grandkids in the area but they think I'm only good for babysitting. My kids would be better off with their dad at least the grandparents will see that they get what they need. I'm exhausted with anxiety. The only emotion left is fear. I haven't had friends for years. If you ignore people long enough they go away, so I've isolated myself completely. I've always been a loner, but now it's killing me. I can't do this.",1

435,"come clean There is, to my knowledge, genuinely only one person who knows how I feel about leaving. Everyday is a fight, and that fight is always a losing one when the folk around you cannot understand what you deal with, what you feel. My problem/problems are not something that can be fixed with kind words, inspiration, proper diet and exercise, etc... I fight horrifying anxiety on a daily basis, sometimes to the point of serious physical damage. It can get so bad that I feel like I'm not actually in the same world as the people around me, and see colors incorrectly. This, and a chronic depression I've had since a young childhood have been eating at me for years and are constantly increasing in intensity. I'm reaching a stage where I contemplate my own end on a nightly basis because the idea of waking up again is so terrifying I shake and I cry. It is not just these two conditions I've stated.. it's just, well heck it's everything at this point. I can no longer handle a full time job, I live on my friend's couch, my vehicle is constantly dying and a slew of other things that I won't bore anyone already bored enough to be reading this bit of business. Now, as previously mentioned there is one person who knows exactly how I feel about all of this and, in a time of need she was there for me and, I stand firm that she and her actions of just coming, comforting, and offering a general understanding are the reason I am alive today. Unfortunately this individual is also an unreliable drug addict who I don't share much else in common with. I don't know what I'm trying say here, I feel that I am all over the place.. on here and mentally lol. Essentially I have been internet researching suicide for the past 4-5 hours alone in a dark room listening to some none so cheery music and I happened upon this forum. Healthy, no?

I'm never the one picked first and when it comes down to it I'm not important enough. So what if I helped them, didn't stop them from hurting me over and over again. To not bother calling or showing up. Don't think anyone could ever like me. Wonder if it's all just a huge, cruel joke. I don't think I WANT to live in this cruel world, humanity is a fukcing joke. They say they want to farm and slaughter animals in a ""humane"" way - well, humans are the only animal killing others JUST FOR FUN. Is that HUMANE?

440,"I want to let myself sink.. I am tired. ( Im sorry for my english, it's not my mother tongue. ) Today I decided for the first time to open up on my toughts of suicide/depression, on the internet. Pathetic right ? I know. I feel like my life is a joke, an entire joke from the begenning and soon to the end. My life cant be put on a couple few lines, pathethics lines which represent my ''life'' . When I was 7, my dad died From a lung cancer and let me tell you it hit like a truck to know what death is at that age, especially when it's your dad. My mom got re-married to his best friend (The most nice guy she could ever met after my father, he ended up me loving him as a father, he is really nice my mom got lucky to get an other man like him) I was doing really poorly at school after that (And I had ADHD already so it didn'T help..). And I was getting fat, so of course I was getting bully pretty much my entire time in school. And of course , it got way worse in high-school and this is when my depression/suicidal toughts started. I felt like I dont deserve to live, seeing everybody able to do what they what they whant, breathe, but I couldn't because I was sinking further and further. ''But'' One day a girl 'enlightened' my life for the first time in my life, the first hope that something was going to change in my life (That's what I tought, I never had a girlfriend before, I just wanted to love someone who loves me back, just for once..) but she broke up with me after 2 week because she was going to move away for her college and she didn't believe in ''long-distance'' relationship but I was willing to do anything for her but at the end she just decided that it was over. After that I was begenning to cut myself because I didn't want to hear my toughts of sadness of how pathetic my life is. I lost literraly all motivation from life and the motivation to go at highschool to get my diploma. I ended up doing a year laying down in my bed and being in front of my computer listening to streams to people who can put an artificial glow in me for a sec. Beside that I hear/do nothing else , just the silence or I should say the loud sound of depression (This was this year) . Yesterday my step-dad was peeing red, my mom was freaking out and told him to do some test at the hospital the next morning. When I woke up (10pm) I went downstair to see my mom drunk (what a surprise she always is) but this time my jaw dropped, I couldn't believe what she just told me something, I wanted to woke up again,not again.... please god....please...please not again....please, im begging you. My mom just said ; - Your stepdad has lung cancer. I feel like I want to move in an other country which isn't oblivion with these toughts. Or maybe go to go into a new/''real'' contry and pretend to have a new life and starting over, but the pressure of depression doesn't want my body to move because my spirit have to much weight and I have no energy to fight, not anymore. I dont deserve to be happy, I dont know what curse I have but when you have the feeling that your life is worthless and seeing death as your best-friend as long as I am breathing. This is the worst feeling, and I want it to stop... But it wont as long as I breathe in this darkness which seems impossible to swim back,and at this point I dont even want to try anymore when there's no glow/light in me anymore, only the dark and a moment or an other, i will embrace it... A moment or an other because I fought so many years, but when it doesn't pay off a single time, you just want to let youself sink. I dont know what to do anymore..",1

I've been trying not to screen calls. I've been open with my family. I even spoke to my psychiatrist about it today, knowing that I was risking going back into hospital (I'm only out seven weeks now). I'm not breaking any rules.

I feel like I should be apart of an AI rather than a human body. My memory is getting very bad too which is very scary. I thought it might be from taking some shrooms a while back and just hppd, but then I realised I've been experiencing minor symptoms of whatever this is my whole life. I told my parents I need help and all they did was call another stupid ass doctor that put me on a wait list of another 3 months to talk in a room with other depressed people. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY FUCKING TIMES I HAVE TO SAY IT'S MORE THAN JUST DEPRESSION. I think it might be depersonilzation disorder or something which could have been triggered from shrooms and all the weed I used to smoke, but would that account for memory loss? Or not really memory loss...but like its harder to remember things. I also get confused really easy. All I know about this whole thing for sure is that I can't keep living like this. If i dont get help by the end of next month I'm killing myself, end of story. Also, being diagnosed with whatevers wrong with me isn't just going to make it go away, ts pointless.

447,"suicide: it is the way it is. i am an expert at self motivating, at self entertainment. i was abused as a child and survived, so my survival techniques are top notch. but i am now middle aged, and life has beaten me down a lot. the fibromyalgia i've had now for about 5 years and that is taking a lot out of me. i had been avoiding feeling this loneliness, this dejection, by moving things around in my mind, by hiding facts in my mind. therapy has taken away a lot of the ways i used to cope, so i now i get to see all the bad things that've happened to me, i get to see just how badly i have been treated, how alone i am, how i have no money and really no voice in this society, as a person of color, as person with severe illness, as a person with no money. i have no way to protect myself really. and so i am depressed. anorexia was something i had used as a teenager to cope, and i find myself pulling that old one out. voices, basically snapping shut, by protecting my mind, is also an old way to cope. i had been trying to tell myself you are not alone, but now that i see is not true. i spend my days and nights upset and alone. afraid to call anybody, because my story is always so sad and nobody wants to hear that really. it is sad to see that though i 've fought the fight, and though i maintain a sunny attitude given all thats happnened to me, the people around me still do not want to have anything real to do with me. now, they won't say that, and that's how i was able to delude myself into thinking i had real friends. society has no place for me. no treatment for fibromyalgia. no one who remembers my pain about that. no treatment for sexual abuse, so my reactions and actions go unrealized. society really has no place for me. to be satisfied with the poriforery, so that's what i must do. to complain about my human self, to complain what about me, is pointless. to be satisfied with the voices, with the anorexia, with being the science project, with being the zoo animal all oogle at. okay. since i am the survivor that i am, i have learned that this is it. and so i sit here, cold, not okay with being alone but also okay with it, because i have snapped my mind shut, the soft parts are protected. no matter what happnes, the soft parts are protected. i can't be everything. i am just one. on another side, this man once told me he knew this black guy who everybody liked, the life of the party. and one night he went home and killed himself. this was a white guy. and as he told me this story, he looked like the devil. and i knew then that that would be my fate. this world does not respond to a black depression. they just don't respond. so i am left pretending i am fine. to act not fine brings me nobody and nothing. so i am to act like i'm fine. and all the while my mind is sinking lower and lower, and then i too, after throwing a huge party, the life of the party, Ms. Positive, Ms. Look at her, Look how she is making the best out of her Unfortunate Circumstances, and then i go home, alone, and kill myself. i do not reach out. i tell no one.

Why couldn't I have just passed out of existence while I slept rather than face another day of nothinginess, of existence not living? I have been living with depression, and anxiety for 40 years. I am 60-years old. I have no joy, no interest in doing anything I used to. Suicide ideation just pops into my head at the strangest times. I went out to my car to take out the CD's so I could listen to my music in my house and the thought just popped into my head. Where did that come from? I wasn't thinking about dying or even wanting to die the idea was suddenly in my mind. I like to be in control and depression and anxiety have taken my ability to control my emotions and thoughts away from me. For years I did control my life, I wore a mask and just told everybody I was ""just fine."" They were awestruck to find out I suffered from major depressive disorder. I agree with those who say that the more intelligent or more educated tend to suffer more from depression yet I don't know if that statement is supported by research or not. Those of us who think a lot, we do the whole existential thing tend to question the value of life more than those who don't spend time mulling over such weighty issues. My therapist tells me to get out of my head and ""think"" with my heart. The problem is my heart died years ago. I have no positive emotions, no feelings of love. I had hoped that when my grandson was born I would be able to hold a newborn baby and feel the love. I felt nothing. How sad is that to not feel love for a child? I also agree with those who say you should not have children if you suffer from depression. Unfortunately I didn't know about the devastation and utter despair of depression before I had my kids otherwise I never would have passed on my genetic structure to my kids. Both have suffered bouts of depression already and it kills me to see them suffer knowing I passed on the vulnerability to become depressed. You know the really ironic part of all this? I have also inherited longevity. My parents are both 92 years old and their folks lived to be 95, 96, and 98. So I have the likelihood of living a very long life - and for what? I don't contribute to society I just use up valuable natural resources that could be better used by other, more productive people. Oh joy. It is almost 5am and i have been unable to sleep most of the night so the rest of the day I will be worthless, fatigued and unable to function - not that I do anything of value anyway.

I'm 19 and I've recently got my BAC diploma (equivelant to SAT in US) I had it a year late because I had to redo a whole year due to constant skipping and very poor grades, however this wasn't always the case, and neither is it the whole story, I've grown up an excellent student, I had prizes and did exceptionally well, I never had friends tho, everyone thought less of me and kept bullying me, at home there's loud arguments everyday, so I became angry and depressed and just gave up on school and became even more of a loner, starting 2006 I've always been at home most of the time on the internet, skipping school and playing games or watching stuff or reading articles, I was decent looking and got interest from a few girls but I never had the guts to ask them out, because beyond my looks there's an insecure unexperienced guy they wouldn't like hanging out with for long, I did have a few relationships when I knew girls were really interested, but I keep being disappointing in matter of personality, and even that had to go one day, I became a hideous pizza face monster starting 2007 and now it has left quite a few big scars on my face and acne is still present; I don't exaggerate at all when I say i'm hideous as hell, and to top it off now I don't even have enough money to continue studies properly, I can't afford rent, bills and school, and when it comes down to it, I live in a Third world country where unemployment rate is insane, unemployed PhD carriers protest in front of the parlement everyday just to be beaten out by authorities, they even do suicide and famine protests, even tho this country is pretty well off compared to other 3rd world countries, you can only live and get a job if you have a lot of connections and money, EVERYTHING from public service to getting a job is handled by bribes, nobody gives a shit if you've got a PhD if you don't have enough cash to BUY your way to a job. I speak 4 languages, quite well educated in scientific matters such as biology, astronomy, anthropology but all my knowledge and talent is just going to waste in this rotten land, when it comes down to it, no matter how much you know, your human needs of fulfillment and achievement will prevail, and if you're failing to meet your needs, your existence seems quite worthless. I still live with my parents, I feel as if I'm crashing against a giant wall and doing it over and over again, I recently knew a girl in europe and we clicked, we spent a lot of time online, she called on the phone, we expressed emotions of love and she was excited about visiting me and even talked about marriage, I envisioned a life with a girl that I love and loves me back, a job with a decent income (anything there beats 5Euros a day min wage here) but it seemed too good to be true, I had my skepticism because I'm not used to a happy world and it turned out quite right, after a while she lost interest, I believed her because I was desperate. Now there goes me, poor, futureless and too hideous to have a romantic life not to mention in a country where most girls are only looking for a rich 1st world husband, I don't exaggerate nor judge, it's their right to seek a better life. I've been quite suicidal for the past few years, I see an very grimm future and if I keep going it's bound to turn me into something evil, twisted, and insane. so I rather skip all of that straight to the grave before it gets any worse because I'm not sure I can handle it. Take this life, I posted this to vent I doubt anyone would have any practical solution.",1

455,"I need serious help Hey... I didn't know how to go about this but I thought I'd give this forum a try I'm a troubled young man (at 24 almost 25) I have been giving plenty of opportunities with my family and friends. I have worn out my resources for places to live and people to be around. My father yesterday told me he doesn't love me anymore and we usually get through things but I feel like he's had it... simply has had it with my lack of trying it's not really anything I've done just simply he's fed up with me not moving forward in life. He said he doesn't really want me around anymore. I don't live in the house with him and the family (him, his mom, etc..) I live in a travel trailer on the family property and the property consists of 10 acres. It hasn't been that bad for me but now that everything is going away I now realize just how good I had it. I've been through the court system and he's tried to get me to do the right thing for so long and I feel like shit about not doing the right things for not just me but everyone who believes in me. Long story short... I need advice on how I'm going to move past this. And the immediate problems are I'm facing potential homelessness or even getting locked up again. And I really don't want any of that I don't even want to be in this shitty trailer anymore. I feel like I should move out but I have limited funds and am living off SSI (social security) for like 700$... and I know I've been a worker most my life but there's some mental issues with me too that doesn't allow me to do well with people - I do however like being around people. My mom doesn't want me around and none of my family is even an option to live with right now. Usually my father is more than good to me - i mean after all he gave me a place to live and tried getting me out of the legal system. But now he's beyond mad and it's almost like he's possessed I know it sounds weird. But, it's just not like him and I'm positive it's my fault. I have been feeling somewhat imaginary suicidal lately and I don't know if I should use that to get into an institution or to just lay down and accept whatever trouble comes my way. I just really need some advice on the whole thing.",1

Where is the suicide part to all this, since i posted this in the suicide forum?

459,"The New Stuff these are the things that i've only very recently accepted --my dad incested me; my memories are my own, are real. my body is telling me the truth, and i can trust it. i have schizophrenia. i have a serious mental illness, that seriously impairs my functioning. that i have no control over. that severely limits my abilities. that prevents me from working, that traps me in poverty. i have a severe mental illness that will not disappear, and will never improve. i am stuck with a mental illness that makes my senses lie to me, that will always keep me guessing what's real. i am a sex addict, obessessed with sex. it is directly related to being raped by my daddy. i am broken beyond repair because my daddy did what he did. my daddy took almost everything when he chose to ravage my body. i love my daddy. always have and always will. he made me feel good, and i love to feel good. i can say out loud, ""I love my daddy,"" even though it sounds kinda creepy, kinda weird. I know i am mad at him AND i love him. (AND i am forever his.) my mom is unavailable to me. she is incapable of supporting me in the way that i need. she will never make me feel safe or loved. i accept the fact that she is my mother in name only. my siblings are also limited. they reject me because they've had the same mother i did; they are lost and child-like, too. i pity them and i pray for them. drugs and alcohol are only going to delay the inevitable. i chose not to do them because it will not fix my brain. it will not help me. i want my apartment. i want my computer. i like having my blankets and teddy bear. if i start with the drugs, i will lose it all. and i don't have much as it is. i've fought too fucking hard for too fucking long and i'm not letting them take my teddy bear again. no fucking way. i don't want to die. i am not a quitter. i have pride. i am a fighter, period. it's just what i do. there is no solution for me. i must be okay with a lot of wrong things. i must be okay with a lot of misunderstanding, a lot of cold shoulders, a lot of angry whispers, a lot of rejection, a lot of jealousy, a lot of inaccurate judgments. i must be patient. i must remeber what's important at all times. i must follow my steps that i have written for myself, steps to appraise what's important, to help myself keep perspective. i know sometimes thing can blow up and get bigger only in my head, and it's up to me to deflate the monster and bring it down to size. i must forgive myself, for all my mistakes, for all my fear responses. i am trying, afterall, making huge effort in the face of overwhelming odds and impossible, lose-lose situations. i give myself mad credit, even when no one else does. i give myself tons of praise. i know that breaking everything up is not going to fix it. i know that a fantastic display of fear, anxiety, and anger will not fix it. i hold on instead. i hold on and do nothing, nothing but try to think and plan and strategize how i want to go about getting a version of what i need, how i can become satisfied with getting much less than what i need, how i can make only a tiny bit of help work for me. These are all things my old therapist taught me. He is responsible for showing me how to intergrate adult behavior into my schizophrenic, frightened, shattered, immature, limited mind. I needed someone to go slow, to explain to me slowly how to function, how people function out there in the real world. He did this. He talked slowly, and answered my questions without incredulousness at my stupidity. He told me jokes that i could understand when I was sad and needed to laugh. He let me cry when I felt sad. He let me stop when I needed to rest. He let me go when I needed to keep going. I don't know why he ""saw"" me, when no one else could ever seem to. I want to ask him why he is different. Maybe I am a bit obessessed with him, but I don't want to hurt him. I am just in a lot of pain, and he's helped me when I was in so much pain before. I keep thinking that maybe he can help me again. That's all.",1

I even made a few promises and kept them until today when I broke them and gave into my urges and I feel like complete shit. I've been building courage to get through the day and keep on keeping on. I'm wondering now for what? Why can't I just build enough courage to end the pain and never have to deal with any of this anymore.

Made me see I have a future, well, I signed for Infantry, my plan for the future is to die in combat. I just don't know if I can last that long. I just hate everything. I'm not fat, or ugly, or anything. I'm from a middle class divorced family with a dad who hates me and a mom trying to make up for all the shit she did to my siblings and I. But I just keep thinking about how the Marine Corps is going to take to long to die, I don't even know if it will make me happier. I might end up on fucking suicide watch during boot camp. My theory is that the average American Male, Goes to college for a degree that they hope will get them a job, gets a job they'll end up hating, buy a middle class house with a mortgage lasting till retirement, get divorced after having a few kids, kids will end up hating them, or they will hate their kids, turn to alcohol to ease the pain, get some form of cancer, and die an old fuck that can't wipe his ass. That is the American Dream. That is all we have to look forward to. How is that a happy ending? Why should I stay alive to experience this?

480,life beyond our control We can't control others only ourselves...how I wish this were completely true. If I could control myself instead of being controlled by others I would say F*ck off when someone took advantage of me instead of crying. If I had control of myself I would think of the perfect comeback when someone said something cruel instead of gaping at them like a idiot. I wouldn't hesitate to negotiate if I knew they wouldn't play fair. If I'd known that marriage was a slave contract for a woman then I would've reveled in my freedom to determine my life without the blackmail of love. If I'd known that working in retail meant rolling in humiliation for a tiny paycheck I would've prostituted myself for better wages elsewhere. In the end I lose.

485,"Coping with a suicide loss One learns to live with the loss, the tragedy, the waste, and the gaping hole in the fabric of one's life. There is no closure, nor would I want one. I want to remember him all my life, vividly: his laughter, the smell of his sneakers under his bed, his moments of joy, his humility, and his integrity. Some survivors struggle with what to tell other people. Although you should make whatever decision feels right to you, most survivors have found it best to simply acknowledge that their loved one died by suicide. You may find that it helps to reach out to family and friends. Because some people may not know what to say, you may need to take the initiative to talk about the suicide, share your feelings, and ask for their help. Even though it may seem difficult, maintaining contact with other people is especially important during the stress-filled months after a loved one's suicide. Keep in mind that each person grieves in his or her own way. Some people visit the cemetery weekly; others find it too painful to go at all. Each person also grieves at his or her own pace; there is no set rhythm or timeline for healing. Anniversaries, birthdays, and holidays may be especially difficult, so you might want to think about whether to continue old traditions or create some new ones. You may also experience unexpected waves of sadness; these are a normal part of the grieving process. Children experience many of the feelings of adult grief, and are particularly vulnerable to feeling abandoned and guilty. Reassure them that the death was not their fault. Listen to their questions, and try to offer honest, straightforward, age-appropriate answers. Some survivors find comfort in community, religious, or spiritual activities, including talking to a trusted member of the clergy. Be kind to yourself. When you feel ready, begin to go on with your life. Eventually starting to enjoy life again is not a betrayal of your loved one, but rather a sign that you've begun to heal. Why Did This Happen? Many survivors struggle to understand the reasons for the suicide, asking themselves over and over again: ""Why?"" Many replay their loved ones' last days, searching for clues, particularly if they didn't see any signs that suicide was imminent. Because suicide is often poorly understood, some survivors feel unfairly victimized by stigma. They may feel the suicide is somehow shameful, or that they or their family are somehow to blame them for this tragedy. But you should know that 90 percent of all people who die by suicide have a diagnosable psychiatric disorder at the time of their death (most often depression or bipolar disorder). Just as people can die of heart disease or cancer, people can die as a consequence of mental illness. Try to bear in mind that suicide is almost always complicated, resulting from a combination of painful suffering, desperate hopelessness and underlying psychiatric illness. Helping Children Cope Children are particularly vulnerable to feeling abandoned and guilty. Listen to their questions, and try to offer honest, straightforward, age-appropriate answers. Survivors frequently seek advice about how to explain suicide to children. Here are some suggestions: When you have a choice, tell them as soon as you have the news, in a place where both you and they will feel comfortable. Reassure them that the death was not their fault. Explain that their loved one died of an illness -- a brain illness. For example: ""Daddy had something like a heart attack except it was a 'brain attack."" Resist the urge to keep the suicide a secret out of fear that the child will copy the behavior of the deceased. Just as families with hypertension, diabetes or heart disease are educated about early warning signs and prevention, relatives of suicide victims need to understand the early warning signs of depression and other mental illnesses so they can obtain proper treatment. Reassure them that you, together with other appropriate adults will take care of them. Let them know they can approach you at any time if they want to talk about it. Children may express their feelings by crying, withdrawing, laughing, or expressing anger at you or others. Or, they may not. Simply let them know you are available for whatever they need -- now or at some later time. Resume and maintain the child's regular routine as much as possible. The greatest gift you can give children is your assurance of love and support. Allow them to express their feelings, answer their questions and provide them with affection.",0
486,"been a while hey there to all of you. i am sorry i haven't been on in so long to check on you all. my life has basically fallen apart - yes even worse than what it was doing before. basically we moved into the new house- i was in the hospital most of the of the first month of course and ""he"" decided he couldn't take it anymore. actually that was his cop-out. he had been dating someone else. so he kicked me out - of my own freaking house! nice. so i actually did it- i attempted - obviously failed which has been the hardest part to deal with. the failure. i can cope with the fact that i'm supposed to be here and it didn't work for a reason but the fact that i failed at something i was pretty sure about as far as knowing what i was doing really kicks me in the gut. i was in the hospital for a few weeks and then had to go through an intensive partial in-patient hospitalization - basically intense group therapy. anyway - had to move back in with my mom...which i hate. can't raise my son like i want and now the ex is fighting me for custody, i lost my job...AND i am leaving the state for a month again for another shot at the surgery that i had last year to see if i can get some relief. the drs don't know what to do with me and are as sick of me as i am of them. anyway...my son is in here wanting some attention so i better go. i just wanted to give an update as to what has been going on the past 3-4 months. i hope you are all okay and i promise to check in with you all more often now that i have so much free time. later - getitout",0
487,"Expressing it...finally. Yah I think I do need to talk about how I am feeling. I haven't been able to really tell anyone about it, or at least how I truly feel. I think about suicide every day. My mom killed her self when I was ten years old and my father left me right when I was born. Everyone that knows me and knows my life has said they don't know anyone else who has had a harder life than me. I am 24 now and lived a life of constant drug abuse for ten years following my moms death. So when I was 20 I got sober and for a while life seemed to get better but this past year has just been the worst. I mean even though I am doing positive things with my life I feel like the time I spend thinking about suicide just keeps increasing. Some days I estimate I spend 4 plus hours a day thinking about it. It has become almost a fantasy and I imagine all the ways I could do it and think about every detail in the process. Its like a movie playing in my head on low volume all the time and I even imagine my suicide while listening to people talk and laughing and going about my normal day. If I were to look at my life on a written paper I wouldn't even believe a person could go on living like this. But something deep down inside me keeps me alive somehow. No matter how much time I spend contemplating suicide I have always known that I couldn't do it. I think this is partly because my mom did it and I saw how bad it hurt everyone around her and that is what stops me. Its like a deep down subconscious knowing that just KNOWS I am not going to do it and I have had it my whole life. Lately though I have noticed myself distancing myself from my close loved ones and I am starting to wonder if this means I might actually do it. Anyway I have these blocks that don't allow me to appear weak to people so no one really knows this is going on. I thought I wasn't ever going to tell anyone but then it hit me that I could just do it anonymously on a forum and maybe it might help. So here is my attempt to to express myself and see if it helps. Thanks for listening.",1
488,"Ideas? Lately I have been having a lot of troubling thoughts of wanting to commit suicide. But, have made no steps or actions in carrying it out. However, I realize these feelings are not normal, and I am afraid of the potential downward spiral effect. When I was a kid, I had these feelings when my parents divorced and when my dad was remarried. I was a verbally and mentally abused child; where I was also molested by my brother from the time I was 6, until I was 14 (when he moved away). I have since beat the huge odds stacked against me and (from what I thought) over came these feelings I had once felt. I am a young one to say the least, just barely 20 years old. I own a few corporations, operate a budget of over 8.15 million dollars a year. I feel overwhelmed in making these business work, and make as much money as possible. Even though the company makes a lot of money, it also owes a lot of it too. To date the companys owe just about 6.8 million dollars, mostly because of equipment and buildings. And, you have to pay taxes, labor, insurance, yadda yadda yadda. It all adds up. The business' is ok, just barely paying everyone and making its loan payments. I feel like a failure, even though a lot of people look at me, and say wow, he is doing great. Have the car, house, dog, boat, etc. I just feel like giving up and quitting. I personally have no debt owed to anyone. Thats all fine, but... the business is another story. I know business owe money when they first start up, but... is this pressure normal? I feel like I am ready to crack, and I dont want to admit I am a quack. My head feels like its going to explode. I just recently bought another rental unit, bringing me to 6 duplexes and my house. Now another payment to deal with, two more tenats to deal with, etc.... To top it all off I have unexplained headaches and take muscle relaxers for it. Only makes me sleepy. Which makes more work for me, thus another headache...an on... an on...! I have had an MRI and besides the unusually large brain, I am fine. But... I dont think I am. I have been breaking into cold sweats, cant sleep, neck and back hurt, and a constant headache. And a slight pain in my chest. Maybe I'll get lucky and die in my sleep. That would be better than my fourtne cookie I got with lunch! Sometimes I just think for once in my life I would finially be able to take the easy way out. I came from nothing, to where I am today. Am I at least alotted a one time free pass? Or do I still owe it to those that want to see me fail (grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc). Do I still show them up, or... give up and give in. Any ideas?",1
489,"What to expect when telling a therpist you're suicidal? So, I've avoided posting in this part of the forumn for awhile, just 'cause it makes the idea of suicide feel more... real. But I'm curious and want some answers. I'm not currently in therapy but when I was, my therapist asked me if I was suicidal. I lied. I was under 18 and assumed they would have to tell my parents, and I couldn't have that. But lets say, hypothetically, I go back to therapy, now that I'm 18, but I am still living with my parents. And I tell them I am suicidal and self-harm. Would they still tell my parents? Would they tell anyone else? My school? And what if they thought it was pretty serious, like if I had a plan? Would they send me off to a psych hospital? Or could I just talk regularly with my therapist about my feelings?",1

I allmost came real close to doing it once and because i work in a chemical lab it is very easy for me to do it. I'm tring to stay positive but it's just not working.

491,"Worthless/want to die I am failing at everything in my life. Being a mother a wife a sister and a daughter and a nurse. I have major depressive disorder,PTSD, panic disorder, And showing signs of borderline personality disorder. I am 35 years old I'm mother of two daughters. My husband does not support me he thinks I'm crazy. When I was 17 I was raped. I kept it to myself and received no help. When my first child was born I had postpartum depression really bad... I now understand why some women killed their children. Luckily I had the strength enough to keep myself away from her when having thoughts of hurting her. I hated myself for having those thoughts, but am glad that God got me through each day. Besides an anti depressant I got through on my own. When my second child came it was opposite I wanted to kill myself. I attempted when she was 2 months. Since I have been hospitalized once more (she is almost 3). I slowly started having problems at work losing focus memory loss then breakdowns and panic attacks. We've tried multiple medication combinations therapy counseling etc., Nothing seems to be helping. I am afraid that I might accidentally hurt one of my patients, Make a medication error. I had noticed slowly that I've been losing vocabulary, which makes my job as a nurse that much harder. I have not been a very good decision-maker it's even worse now. I have no right actively working as a nurse. I don't qualify for FMLA, and don't have short term disability. I need to work, my family could not survive without me working. So I'm out of options. I'm hurting my girls with my behavior. They either see me sad or constantly angry frustrated all the time. My husband doesn't support me and he wants to leave. I have no right living and messing up so many lives. How dare I make my own child resent me because I can't get out of bed. Or my little one ask me multiple times in a day "" mommy are you sad"". I'm a pathetic piece of worthless crap. I see no hope. My faith is gone. Each day is so painful for me to bare, that I want to die. I will die!",1
492,"Weird I read something on someone's blog, and it kinda stuck with me. I don't want to commit suicide, I don't want to kill myself, but, I wish I could just be dead It's a terribly confusing feeling/thought, but somehow that's how it is. Of course I can't be dead without committing suicide, but I wish that somehow it would be possible. Realising this, I begun to feel stuck. Between wanting to die but not being able to kill myself, and going on and on and on and continue living like a zombie. What to do?!?! I wish I could just dissolve and be gone.",0
493,"Scared? Whenever I come to the point that I'm thinking suicide I always end up in this dilemma. I'm scared to do it, yet I want to. If that makes sence? I'm scared of leaving my family more devastated then they already are I'm scared of no one caring, except my family But I would finally relax... I'm not thinking of ever doing it. Mainly because I'm scared of ^^. I believe that I'll live a new life. How? I don't know. This is just my thoughts when I eventually think of it... Is it suppouse to be like this?",0
494,"Lost again When I was 14 I had severe depression because things aren't always easy in life and I guess I had bad luck. I had many thoughts about killing myself and ending all that inevitable pain, but the thought of leaving my mom behind, to leave her alone just made me stick around. Then I got better, I realised I had much to live for. Now, it's been 5 years and I'm starting to think a lot about that a lot, again. Whenever I get drunk, which never used to happen, I just... I feel it so intensely, I just don't want to live anymore. I had good things in my life, but everything goes to waste everytime. I'm not sure what to do, I just need peace",1

497,"No self worth left I first want to say I never knew how truly stupid I was, how lacking in self worth, self respect and values. I am quite simply nothing. I seriously don't know how to continue on just surviving after yesterday. I hit rock bottom again but it's lower than I have ever sunken before. Mum says that there is only up now. If she knew how much I threw my pride away yesterday, I'm sure she would denounce me once again as her daughter, claim her contempt for my lack of courage and any self pride. I didn't go to work yesterday was having another mental break down. It's all been too much, my mum is dying, my nephew is dying of cancer and I'm quite pathetically still in love with my ex boyfriend. 6 months later he still says he loves me but is not in love and that he wants to be friends. All I did yesterday was smoke, cry and sleep. I laid in bed in the darkness thinking of ways to end it all. I either rang or texted various members of my family crying out that I wanted to die. If that wasn't bad enough I ended up continually texting my ex, all of my self pride went down from there. I asked him if he was in love with me (how fucking stupid!!!) he said he didn't love me that way anymore. How I wish the stupidity ended there. I then asked him if he could grant me one last favour and hold me one more time. I said I didn't want to be alone that night. He said he didn't think that was healthy for either of us. Of course he said no...he doesn't fucking love me....how fucking brain dead am I?!?!!! I asked him just to leave me alone, that I was hurting beyong belief and just wanted to end it all. He wouldn't stop texting me back and said he would ring the police if I did anything to myself. He wanted me to swear I would not try anything. I told him no, that once I get the balls I'm going to do it. I cringe, here is this poor guy who's only mistake is that he dated me for a year. Who now only feels tringes of pity for a mentally fucked up girl that just wants to die. I still want to die. I am humiliated beyond belief. I am my own worse enemy and don't think I could ever look him in the eye again. Oh how I wished when he broke up with me, I just said okay and went into no contact and stuck it out. At least then I would of had some pride, that would of been of some solace. I am fucked but what hurts is that now he knows how much, and who was once a lover is now my enemy and I have let him see how weak I am, how worthless and how pathetic. He talks to me now like a mentally deranged person, soft tones, sad smile and sympathetic eyes. He once adored me, now I'm nothing. His little neice was born yesterday and the picture my mind paints of him holding her kills me. He will never hold our baby. He use to talk of marriage and children but he will share his future with someone else not me. Not me. Yes I want to die and figure if the people around me really loved me they would be happy to see me not fight any more with my darkness. Yesterday showed me that I am truly alone in my pain. I am surrounded by family but distant from everyone. I won't talk about my despair to them anymore...whats the point they can't do anything about it and it just upsets them. I don't believe in anything anymore. I have tried so many ways to stop loving someone who doesn't love me. Researched the internet, unsuccessfully tried no contact (but thats hard working with him), read books, tired to change my perception of the event, tried to hate him, tried to think of him as dead...I have tried in so many ways to go on. I'm not wanting to die for him. I want to die for me. Like I said to him you have 25 years of fighting depression than talk to me. I believe in God but don't believe he loves me. I have cried my tears to him, pleaded and begged, got angry and shouted but mostly just wept and asked him to help me accept and move on. I woke up this morning, once again. And all I want to do is die.",1

I always upset her when she see's how much I've mutilated my wrists. I'm an actual freak, the other day I got really frustrated because of my huge 'quagmire' chin, that I tried to cut it off.

Im finding myself thinking back to self harming too often. Thinking that I shouldn't bother trying anything anymore because something always seems to go wrong. Family is not the least bit supportive. I find myself wanting to go home less and less. And everytime I'm there, there is almost always something that they complain about me. I work, I help pay bills, buy food, keep things running as smoothly as posible. But one slip, one moment of getting angry and suddenly nothing I do matters. I try to reason, try to explain but they just keep throwing excuse after excuse at me. I confront them and they lie, I help them and they abuse. I want to get out but can't, I try to remain calm but the feelings of desperation, of wanting to give up grow. Why should I keep trying? Why do everything I can to help if they're always going to put me down? Always going to find some flaw in me, something to complain about? What more do I have to do? Do I have to resort to more extreme measures? Do I have to no longer be there for them to realize what their doing? I hate how hypothetical they all are. Everyone acts all concern when something extreme happens. Back in November, when I was in a car crash that should have killed me, everyone was all sobs and ""are you ok""? Yet here I am, lucky to be alive let alone standing on my feet, trying to make things work and they complain. Do I really have to die for them to see? Is that what it will take for them to snap out of their idiotic states of mind? Because everyone sure as hell seems to get over themselves when death comes knocking.",1

Last year I was diagnosed with severe depression and after being forced to go to a mental hospital because I was contemplating suicide, I had gotten better with time. Now the depression is resurfacing and I'm going to therapy and have just started going to a depression group, while also taking medication. The dogs don't let me or my family members sleep, and I already called animal control, and apparently they sent the neighbors a warning, but they continued to let their dogs bark. My mother also went to them to calmly ask them to do something about it, and it did work for one day, but afterwards the dogs were allowed to bark again and again. This situation has made me hate the system. Why must they make it so hard for me to solve this problem. I can log the barking times and such and send them the papers, and they will cite the neighbor, BUT the neighbor can challenge the citation and receive information about the log I filled out, including my NAME and ADDRESS. So if I go this route, I am assured to have bad relations with my neighbors, and the man who responded to my mother that day she went to them was extremely defensive and just an angry person. I fear for a strong retaliation from him. I've also called 311, and they said that they can't help. If I call the police, which I doubt would be effective for something like this, the neighbors will know because the officers would come to our home after talking to the neighbors. So now it's come to this. I don't want to stay up in the long hours of the night, thinking of my already worsening depressive thoughts, being FORCED to think about them as I hear the loud ringing of the barking... I'm weak, yes I know. Something like this shouldn't be worth taking my life for. BUT IM WEAK. I can't deal with it anymore. The despair I feel when I also think about how my parents are affected from this is unbearable. My father already has sleeping issues and has to go to work at five in the morning every day. The headaches throughout the day, the stress, the fact that I'm undecided about what I want to do, if I want to continue college or not... I'm sorry but I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I don't want to go to that mental ward again as well.. That was horrible. If I call the police talking about wanting to kill myself... ILL BE PUT THERE AGAIN... I hate it there... I'll be left behind again and delay myself from having a good future yet again.. I hate that noise. That demonic, brain-twisting chorus of Satan's own hounds makes me wish I were gone from this world. This post may be ignored, edited away, destroyed... Who knows. But if there's someone out there that can help, please... This is destroying my mind..",0

510,Depressed and bad thoughts Hi I am new here. I am hoping to get some help for my bad thoughts and maybe some better answers than ending my life. I know you all aren't professionals but sometimes just sharing my thoughts seems to help. This is my first time here. Never have been to a depression or suicide forum. So here it goes. I have not been diagnosed with depression. I have have bouts of feeling depressed since I was a kid (I am almost 23 now). I was picked on in grade school so my self esteem is low. My mother is an aloholic. I have been getting help through alanon (like AA but for family members). Which has helped tremendously. I started going to a counselor in September which helped my anxiety. I never told her about my suicidal thoughts though. I know I should but hiding it is so much easier. The first time I felt suicidal I was about 16. My mothers alcoholism was getting worse and her marriage was failing. I lost my childhood dog and grandpa in the same month. I also was dealing with problems with people at school. Things got better once I graduated high school and moved out of my moms with my now husband. Suicidal thoughts started back after I had started the birth control Nuvaring after having my first child. I think it may have been related. I was dealing with stress over being a new mother and we were buying a house. I started having vivid dreams of how I would do it. I would have hallucination of seeing myself or someone doing it. It was scary. I don't know what triggered me at that point in my life to be thinking that way. I was happily married and had a beautiful little girl so I shouldnt be thinking that way. I decided to get off the birth control and it helped. I talked to my husband about my thoughts and it was the first time i had opened up about that type of stuff. Things started getting better once we moved in to our new house and were more financially stable. My relationship with my mother is not so great. Two months ago I got into a big argument with her. I told her she had the choice between the alcohol and her daughter and if she didnt get some help she wouldnt be able to come around. I let her come to my daughters bday party last week and have been talking off and on with her. But I feel so lonely. Not just because of less contact with her. But also less contact with my entire family. My family doesn't get along. So I feel so pushed away from them and im sad. I have awesome inlaws but I feel so shy around them and like i have to be someone im not. I feel lonely because I don't have that many close female friends. I have been thinking about suicide more lately but I know I couldnt do it to my husband and kids. I know they would not make it without me. but this sadness is killing me inside. I want people to like and love me. I want to be appreciated and cared about. I just hope i can be happy again. I thought I would be happy not having my mom around as much but the truth is im not. I am very sad. Thanks for listening..,0

512,"how much more can i take? so i have dealt with depression all of my life, im 30. It got worse about 2 1/2 years ago. I was in a lawsuit against my former employer over the fact of what i was dealing with mentally that caused me to get fired. About 4 months ago my bride to be called it off, a week later had another man living with her and her 3 kids. And couple weeks ago received a letter of their marriage cert in the mail addressed to me. I spent a few days in mental ward back in march voluntarily. I have quit taking the meds they prescribed me. I can't function in life on these meds. And without the meds i feel even more lost mentally. I feel stuck in neutral with nowhere to go. I know there is alot i want to accomplish with what life i have left, but don't feel that any of it is necessary at the moment. I had so much and lost all of it so fast. which way is up?",1
513,"fibromyalgia makes me turn away from people. i am avoiding a friend. because i have fibromyalgia and i can not hear from one more person how they think i am lying about my symptoms. a friend is supposed to believe what i say and not question me. a friend is supposed to be supportive no matter what. i can not take that risk and call her because what if she says, ""i saw you running and seemed fine to me."" fibromyalgia is weird like that. one moment i can walk and the next i'm too tired or i'm in too much pain. it is the nature of fibromyalgia. and when my friends get angry and testy with me, i don't appreciate the hostility in tone. i am in agony most of the time with this damn fibromyalgia and to opne the door to a friend is dangerous, is risky to me because a friend can hurt you; they can hurt you with an ignorant comment that hits squarely your sore spots. a friend is someone you've shared your weaknesses with and so if that friend decides to turn on you, they can hold up your sore spot and really stick it to you. that is what i am afraid of. and i am too fragile right now to even try, to even take that chance. because she may turn out to be very understanding. but i can not take that chance because then i will be hurt and cry and be upset. no one understands how painful this fibromyalgia is for me. no one understands how angry i am that i feel so terrible all time. no one understands the grief and feelings of loss and sadness over this fibromyalgia, as the fibro has taken away my spontanaety. instead of my friends showing compassion for me and my suffering, the get angry at me and call me a liar instead. i do not need that. i don't understand fibromyalgia either; i don't know why i can walk sometimes and other times i can't. all i know is that i hurt and i feel crappy almost all of the time. i am definitely sensitive about this fibromyalgia. don't anyone question me, i want to yell. i tell you the truth: when i say it hurts, it hurts. i put this in the suicide form because i sincerely believe i will kill myself over this fibromyalgia one day.",1
514,"Tired I migrated from the depression forums, now to the suicide forum. I am just flat out tired. You know I've had many days like this, I've been to institutions, forums, & things got better for a second, just to crumble and fall back down which tells me that my life will never get better, so I'm think about just taking my life. The reason why I won't is because I don't want to go to the lower depths.. I might though...I've hit rock bottom today...So, we'll see.. People look at this as a problem, but it's just for people who feel like they can't take it anymore..I mean we were basically forced to live. We didn't ask to be born, selfish or not. It was selfish of a parent to want 6 kids & not think twice about what the kid might want in life, much less give it to them. Don't try to talk me out of it, I just needed to vent.

515,"Life's a burden I woke this morning wishing i was dead as i do most days because the emotional pain i feel is unbearable. I wish i had something to numb the pain just some relief from my problems that i cannot solve. I don't do drugs although i now understand why ones do, i drink to forget the pain but just feel worse after, and i don't have the guts to take my own life. I exist now only to die- i yearn for death and each day is a burden to me, a hindrance. I stay alive only to shield others from the pain of my suicide, although i do believe that life goes on for those left. Yes there's pain and sorry, but relief for those gone.

526,"Stressed beyond my limits A few years back I lost my job due to back problems, I have spinal stenosis coupled with 2 bulging disks. That combined with the fact that for the previous 10 years I had been a truck driver so my back was taking a beating while being seated and unmoving for such long periods of time cause the muscles in that area of my back to atrophy. It started slowly I found I was in pain when I had to stand or walk for more than few minutes, but instead of taking time off of work to get it checked I simply reduced how much i stood or walked in order to keep working. This facilitated a nasty cycle where the less I did the more weight I gained, the more weight I gained the more pain I was in so I did less. Eventually I could no longer perform the required tasks for the job and had to leave, I had disability insurance and that kicked in because the doctors stated I could no longer do the job. Doctors that I went to took the approach of pain management and instead focused on my weight, they were sure that i had heart problems, so sure that even when a stress test came back fine they still order a heart cath. The doctor that performed the procedure said that I had the heart of a teenager, nothing wrong. Doctors still could only see my weight when i went to them and ignored my back, they went so far as to order me physical therapy which was a miserable failure, it put me in so much pain that for every day I spent doing it i spent 2 days unable to do much more than sit in pain and not move. By this time i no longer had medical coverage but since i am a veteran the VA covers me for that but their care is more of the same, manage the pain (100mg of Tramadol 4 times per day, 1600mg methocarbamol 4 times per day 30mg meloxicam twice a day). This has gone on over the past 3 years, during this time I lost the relationship that I had been in for the last 10 years including the 2 kids of hers that I considered my own, I lost my license and vehicle because I didnt have the money to keep the vehicle nor the energy/inclination to renew the license, and was forced to move. Through it all I had been being supported by the small monthly check I get from the disability insurance, they also started my disability claim which has been turned down twice because they state that I can still work if I do so seated, they fail to take into account that with exception of a recliner at the house that I have cushions duct taped in the perfect places I can not sit in any other chairs for more than 15-20 min before the pain gets to be bad enough that I need to move. I dont sleep well either, 2-3 hours max at a time before the pain wakes me up and i have to go sit in the recliner, so my days are a constant cycle of sleep until pain is more than i can sleep through then sit up until the exhaustion out weighs the pain. The disability company retained a law firm that specializes in disability claims and they have gotten me a hearing for my appeal. This brings me to now, I live in a house with a roommate, he helps as he can with taking me places when he isnt working, the house is rural so no public transportation is available, I am about a month out from my hearing and stressing out over it cause I fear if it is denied then my source of income will go leaving me homeless and hopeless. Having spent the majority of the past 15 years on the road doing long haul trucking the only friends I have are online ones in far away places and family is not an option for help, all of this has me thinking about an exit strategy to end the pain, suffering and stress.",1

528,"empty I think about killing myself all the time; I lose time at work thinking about it. I know I need help, but I can't talk about it. I only have one friend, and she's great, but I don't want to tell her because I don't want her to blow the whistle. I hate phones - I'm not comfortable with them in any way, so calling a hotline is not something i'll do. I tried emailing the samaritans, but it didn't help; I don't have anything much to say, and I just didn't feel any kind of connection. Ultimately, I found it more frustrating and fake-feeling than anything else... which is not to disparage the people on the other end who are trying to help. They didn't do anything wrong, it's just the consequences of me knowing too much psychology and how to 'deal' with someone who's suicidal. I don't even have any real hope that posting here will help, but I can't seem to stop reaching out. As I said, I think about killing myself all the time. Nothing particularly bad or stressful is going on in my life. There is no trigger. I have clinical depression that goes in cycles, and has as far back as I can remember. I'm never really happy, but I sink into a deep depression about once a month. It's not uncommon for me to contemplate suicide during this time. I've had a plan of one kind or another since I was 16. I don't self-harm though -- i don't feel any relief through pain. The depression has been getting worse though, and this time, even though i'm not in my 'slump' anymore, I still want to die. I just don't see the point of me being alive. I don't contribute anything, I'm not a particularly nice person, I don't have the drive to do anything great. I spend a lot of time complaining and projecting my own inadequacies onto others. I used to enjoy reading, but now I mostly do it because I have nothing else to do. i tried looking for classes or clubs in my area, but there is nothing reachable in my time and budget. I'm extremely lonely; the one friend I mentioned is 2 hours away. I talk to my coworkers at the office, but not as much as most people, and I don't really get to know them. I'm 32, and most people at work are older or younger than me. The ones who are my age aren't interested in making friends because they're busy with their own lives/families. I've tried online dating, but I get either a) creepy people who obviously didn't read my profile and only want a one-night stand, or b) people who seem cool, but then seem too cool, so I can't bring myself to message/ meet them because they'll only be disappointed. i've lost my sex drive, but I really just want someone to hold and love. I haven't changed in all these years, despite knowing I need to and wanting to, so I've realized that at this point, it's clear I never will change. The thought of being alone and unchanging like this for another 30 years brings me to tears. I've started giving things away in preparation. I'm not in any rush, but I don't think I can go another year.",1

530,"My severe Depression Well, since this website is all about rambling on about one's problems, I guess I'll have my say. I'm a clinically depressed person who's phased in and out of sadness for as long as I can remember. I'm depressed and frustrated over my sexuality, appearance, and my future. I guess I can start with the first. when I was thirteen, I was very confused about my sexuality, but I never really cared and ignored the topic until I was fourteen. When I was fourteen, I discovered I was gay and was depressed for it ever since. I used to view it as a horrible thing that I should deserve to die for until around two weeks ago when it just became a bother to me, since it's harder to find a mate, let alone acceptance from people Secondly, my appearance. I was born from an eastern European mother and a UK islander father, although my dad grew up on Kansas city, which makes me the spawn of a redneck oaf. this means that I look subsequently horrid. Don't try to assure me that I'm not ugly, because all of my life I've been told that I'm unattractive, or ugly, that no one would ever sleep with me. The only people who told me that I was attractive were people on the internet who felt a bit sorry for me. My hair is also wretched too. Dead, wavy and curly. The only thing my mother could do to help it was take me to her hair lady, which helped a bit. But honestly, it isn't ever worth the pain that I had to go through for it. It's a waste of time, since I doesn't really even fix anything. I was also born with a bit of a hairy body, mostly on my legs, which I find as ugly as hell. Finally, I have to worry about my pitiful future. what does it hold? probably nothing valuable. I can't think of a future college that I would go to after high school, and I lack so much will that I probably won't even care for high school after a bit. I can't even find living a life of responsibility like that possible, since I'm so unorganized and dependent, I probably wouldn't be able to make it on my own. All of my life, especially now, suicide seems like the only option. all of my problems are either genetic or attached to life, and can't be changed. I've already tried self harm a few times, which were a bit unsuccessful, but sometimes I've been so willing to take my life. To know that if I had to kill myself, that I would totally and completely do it. I wouldn't even care if I died right now at the age of fifteen, at least it would be over with. At least I could be done with myself. I feel like real happiness is something I can't have. I hate myself, and I want to die.",1
531,"Undeserving... The last couple of months have been awful. I've been awful. I'm hurting the two people I love most in this world. Let's forget all sexual abuse for a moment.

I can't go back to college because I cut myself and they don't want my kind there. It's not as simple as just stopping. I've tried. Nothing's helped. I've been cutting since I was 10. I can't do it all anymore. I wake up and paint on a mask. Pretending that everything's ok. I try to make it through the day. The nights are the hardest. When I'm completely alone, I scrub off the mask, and the emotions hit me full force in the heart. It's already broken. How small can the pieces shatter? Can they be put back together?

My wife was really understanding ( and the day I lost my job she kicked my out of the house - it was only later I discovered she was having an affair with a guy he told her it was ok as long as she converted to his religion of islam !) I then spent every day for the next 5 years looking for jobs - to no joy. I rang Samaritans, and the woman there eventually said to me she would support my decision if I killed myself.

The doctors cannot find anything physical wrong with me. My children have both dis-owned me. So basically I am in constant pain, I have no friends, no family, no job, no hope. It is only cowardice that has prevented me from ending it. Even the psychologist I have seen has no answers to my problems. I say all this in the hope that it MIGHT help somebody out there. I pretty much have all the bases covered in terms of reasons to commit suicide. EVERYTHING has been taken away from me. If you feel suicidal - ask yourself this question - have you really hit rock bottom? Have you had as much crap in your life as me? I say I have not hit rock bottom NOT in a positive sense, I just know that I will end up dead in a ditch. ( either by my own hand or by my body giving up ). I haven't told you everything - I probably have completely bored you already. All I want to say is this Whoever you are - whatever you do - you are better than me. You have someone who cares about you (me at the very least for what its worth) I don't have anyone. I feel constant guilt for living when there are more worthy people out there who don't. I am a nothing more than a parasitic drain on the worlds resources. I'm sorry for taking up your time with my inane drivel. I wish you the joy and happiness that I will never receive.",1

535,"7 years later and this is how I feel (rough night)- angry rant-trigger? I never thought that suicide would be the easy way out and I don't think you can quite comprehend the bitter loneliness of that limbo between life and death until you have ""lived"" it. All I remember that day is the numbness. The pain I had been feeling for years had escalated to the point to where I just didn't feel it anymore. I got up, took a shower, drove to 3 different stores so it wouldn't be obvious. I maxed my credit card out buying what I thought would be the last purchases of my life. I don't think I believed that I would do it, until I was sitting there on my bed. I had decided that I really just couldn't take it anymore. I don't care who you talk to or what they say, but no one truly wants to die. I laid down on my pillow and closed my eyes waiting to fall asleep. And as I laid there I began to cry. The finality of what I was doing hit me so hard. I wasn't just ending my life, I was ending my very existence and I felt panic and I felt ashamed. I mean how weak am I that I couldn't even handle just living my life anymore. I had become so weak, I had just given up. Obviously I didn't die because I am sitting here at this very moment, all these years later, writing about something so taboo in my life and yet I still want to die. If god would take me, i would willingly go with him, and these are hard thoughts and feelings to have on a daily basis. So for anyone who wants to spout that people who commit suicide are selfish, I would like to say fuck you! How would you like to live in horrible pain and anguish everyday, feeling like you're a mistake of life, and that the world would be better off if you were dead? But I suppose we're suppose to endure it so loved ones won't be sad or hurt. Well okay, I'll suffer for the next 50 years, sinking deeper and deeper until I am actually one with the scum of the earth and you can go on and live your happy life and be content because you can still be in my company. How is that not fucking selfish?! *guess I am having a hard time tonight and these are just my thoughts for this moment, I hope I didn't offend anyone.",1
536,"The Hunter S. Thompson school of thought To quote Thompson's suicide letter: No More Games. No More Bombs. No More Walking. No More Fun. No More Swimming. 67. That is 17 years past 50. 17 more than I needed or wanted. Boring. I am always bitchy. No Fun — for anybody. 67. You are getting Greedy. Act your old age. Relax — This won't hurt. and as a friend of his said: He told me 25 years ago that he would feel real trapped if he didn't know that he could commit suicide at any moment. I don't know if that is brave or stupid or what, but it was inevitable. Unless I'm totally missing Thompson's point, this is pretty much how I feel about life. I don't plan on comitting suicide. Not right now, anyway. But I'm trapped in a life that has nothing to offer me. I don't enjoy anything. I have no hope to ever have real dreams, and even less hope to ever make an effort to achieve them. I just do what is necessary to get by, and enough to keep myself from looking like a total failure. But I've never really been happy with anything I've done. I supplement my dissatisfaction with life with cheap thrills. Not to give myself pleasure, but to feed compulsion. I do things so I don't have to think about how much I hate myself. Killing myself obviously wouldn't make me ""happy."" But, Hell, neither does living.",1

DONT say talk to someone! there is no one for me to talk to, i have no family. i live with my dad and hes an idiot. he doesnt care about me. my best friend moved away. too scared to call a helpline. tried to get therapy takes months with NHS and at my school they are very public about it and i cant have anyone see and find out i get therapy.dont question it cant happen. whats the fucking point. i should just die. i cant go on. i seem so happy to everyone around me. im two faced. i would just LOVE to know what theyd think if they found out i killed myself. theyd never ever expect it. theyd realise all that time i wasnt okay. i dont know what to do",0

They're probably gonna be surprised, but not sad, no. I've written hundreds of suicide notes. I've found papers from somewhere around age 8 that just further convince me I don't want to deal with this anymore. I'll just type it for you: I don't like being sad I don't know why I am. A lot of my friends are happy. Why can't I be? I don't like it. (Can't tell what it says right here). I think the world would be better if I was gone. If mom and dad never had me, I think the world would be better. I don't like this. It's sad and I'm scared. I wish I wasn't born because I think my whole family would be better if I wasn't. I'm bad, and I don't know why I'm here. Usually I'd burn the drafts to make sure no one found them. I tried to kill myself three times, but none worked (obviously). My parents never found out. I'm not happy. As much as I feel like a really should want to get better, I don't. As much as I want to go to my parents and say all of this, I don't.

You could've ignored me at first, but no, you were selfish, you wanted to make yourself feel better so you said you'd ""always care"". I'm sick of tired of people doing this to me.

545,"New here and email from a ""friend"" Hi all, I am new here. I tried to take my life 3 years ago on this very day. I got involved with someone I shouldn't have and he decided, after I destroyed my life to be with him, that he didnt want to be with me. Needless to say it was one of the hardest things I have ever had to deal with. Well this person is back in my life thru mutual club events that we belong to. He is back with his wife and all seems so perfect. These people wanted nothing to do with me and now they are back involving themselves in clubs that I belong to to stay away from them. Anyways, the email. I got this today in response to an email asking for some moral support from this person. I haven't been able to stop crying since I got it. I feel that I am slipping back into that dark hole again, the one where you know you wont feel anymore pain. I am currently on the highest dosage of Effexer that they will prescribe and it works most of the time, but sometimes life gets a bit overwhelming. She did apologize and said that she hoped that I wasn't hurt by this part of her response. But how can you not be? This person has helped me overcome alot of issues over the past 3 years and it seems that when I need her the most she decides that she is tired of it. How does she think that I feel? I'm the lucky one that gets to live it everyday. Anyways here it is... ""I only hope that you can, some day, put it behind you...you really do need to move forward, and find some peace , and, I hope this doesn't offend you, but I find it harder and harder to listen to the same stuff all the time.....I cherish your friendship, and Sunday was so much fun....but so often it seems we just talk about them all the time, and I'm so sorry, but I just get so tired of it....""

I don't want to leave a mess, my current landlord has been very generous towards me, and I would hate to leave him with a body in his home or even my stuff. There doesn't seem to be anyway to avoid a mess, though I could pack my things and kill myself in the park. My current options are xxxxx and xxxxx. The last time I did something mischievous I was making xxxxx in my bathroom, a man showed up at my door. He was drunk, claimed Jesus was Lord, and he wanted to give me a blowjob, I turned him away.

550,"Lost desire to live My depression first started back when I was about 11 years old, it began shortly after my mother and I became homeless and ended up moving in with a relative. During the time that I lived with my relative I ended up getting molested by an older cousin, I started to have thoughts of self-hatred and despise for myself. After living with my mom for a for awhile, I finally decided to try living with my father due to how unhappy I was at the time. That ended up being a bigger mistake, my father was never home and I ended up spending a lot of my time alone in my room. After my first year of living with my father I ended up having my first migraine due to stress and anxiety. The doctor at the time told me there was nothing that could be done to help me with the migraines, that I would just have to deal with them as they came. When I hit high school that's when my depression hit me with full force, towards the end of my freshman year my dad finally decided to take me in to see a doctor. The doctor prescribed me anti-depressant. After I ran out of the first prescription I never asked for it to be refilled because it didn't help and all I was doing was sleeping because of it. When I graduated out of High School I ended up reaching out to my mother for the possibility to move back in with her, which she accepted without hesitation. I was still dealing with depression but not on a major scale at the time. Things went extremely south when I hit 21, I had a good group of friends and was living alone in my own apartment. Two of my friends who were dating ended up seperating, and the girl asked me if I could house her boyfriend at my place for a little while till he could find someplace to live since she didn't want him living with her at her place. I agreed, and laid down the ground rules to him; 1. Don't eat my food without asking. 2. Don't bring people over without asking 3. He's here for 3 months and after that he can find someplace else to live. He ignored both rules almost instantly, brought over at least 3 different girls while staying with me then got them drunk and slept with them on my bed, along with eating food that was mine. Towards the end of the third month I was informed that while he was staying with me he was trying to get back together with his ex (the friend who asked if he could stay with me). I was angery with him, and ended up asking him to leave. After he left, I informed his ex that he was sleeping with other girls while staying with me. She got furious with both myself and him, and stated she never wanted to talk to either of us again. I kinda just shrugged at the time and figured that as long as she didn't get back together with him that's all that mattered. About a month later I received a threatening message from the guy who was staying with me, stating he knew what I did and I better watch my back. I didn't pay any mind to it cause I really wasn't afraid of him. Shortly after the message my truck got vandalized, all my windows were bashed in and 'Rapist' was spray-painted along side of my truck. I was extremely confused until I found out when I informed my friend that her ex was sleeping around with other people while trying to get back with her, she decided to spread a rumor saying that I raped her. I lost all hope over everything, I felt like I couldn't trust people anymore, it really felt like she should have just killed me because the accusation that she had made of me nearly did. I ended up hiding in my apartment not talking to anyone for 4-5 months, and throughout that time my thoughts for suicide kept getting stronger and stronger until I finally attempted it. It ended up failing but not without reprecussion. I ended up getting taken away by an ambulance due to the non-stop vomitting and pain I was in, and had a MRI done to ensure I wasn't having an aneurysm due to the amount of pain I was feeling along the back of my head and neck. I never informed any of the medical staff that tended to me that it was a suicide attempt, I had them believe it was a panic/anxiety attack. When I became hospitalized my mother came and picked me up and had me move-in with her til I recovered, which I never really did. After a year or two of living with my mother again, I found a prescription to help me sleep when I had a back injury at my old job. I ended up attempting again. My mother the next morning literally had to shake me awake, my head was completely blurry and I couldn't keep myself from swaying. When I finally tried to stand up I found I had no strength or balance at all and stumbled across the room into the wall. It became apparent that I had done something the night before and my mom carried me to her room where she cared for me throughout the day as I continuously vomitted and blacked out. I haven't attempted suicide again since though it is constantly on my mind, like a voice in the back of my head repeating non-stop from when I am awake till I sleep. Some days it is worse than other, as of recent the thought has gotten a lot stronger and consistant. I tell myself every day I can't do it, at least not yet due to the fact that it would break my mother. Beyond my mother, there is no one else in my life that I honestly care how my death would affect them. I haven't spoken to my father in years, and I don't really have any other relatives that I am in contact with. I've hear people state things like 'Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem', 'Suicide is the cowards way out', etc. and honestly neither of those things change how I feel about it because I have dealt with it so long without relief. I saw another psychiatrist a year back or so, was given two different prescriptions for my depression which neither worked and I ended up stopping my psychiatric sessions because the psychiatrist only seemed interested in giving me meds.",1

552,"College life makes me want to fucking kill myself... THe sad thing is I'm not taking any real hard classes at all. They're mostly physical fitness classes, and my online classes are a breeze. It's just the atmosphere and the fact that it's taking me ten years to get one degree. High school was easy for me in retrospect, but I never fit in the social atmosphere of any of the schools (I've been to three). I always eneded up hanging out with the stoners and skaters at every school I've been too...which was cool cause at that point I didn't really give two shits about anyone other than the people I was cool with and myself...but boy was I lonely most of the time. Now, here I am at 27 finishing up my bachelors. I'm just too old to be here and it's painfully obvious everytime I step through this joint. People look at me like I'm some kind of weirdo, whereas I'm the one looking at them like some kind of weirdo. I constantly have people staring at me whenever I'm walking through the campus and it just pisses me off. What the fuck are you staring at? Didn't your mother ever tell you not to stare? I just attribute it to the backwater and uncouth nature of this area. In fact I get obnoxious stares pretty much most of the time I go places. When I'm in a coffee shop blogging on tumblr, I've been getting stares from people cause they act like they've never seen a black dude blogging on his computer in a coffee shop before. I honestly don't get people staring at me in any other city I've been to except Pittsburgh and it's mind boggling. As well, I feel like I can't even relate to like 99.98% of people in this city anymore and the Pitt campus. I'm a rogue agent as far as it's concerned. I embrace my unique qualities, but it sucks being is such a stupid, cultureless and conformist city as this one. It drives me insane. I just want to graduate and get the hell out of this city before I end up harming myself something serious. I can't stand it anymore. The one thing I hate about it is being here always reminds me of how much I don't want to be here and how things worked out for my friends and never worked out for me. This is probably the reason I don't want to talk to any of my high school friends anymore. TI put myself in my own world where their constant bragging about buying about new houses, cars, new jobs, new significant others doesn't even matter to me anymore. Fuck them. They're dead to me. It frustrates me being in this stupid, pissant, redneck, uncultured, xenophobic city and college and I want to get the fuck out. It's sad. Yesterday, I was actually feeling good. But then again, it was sunny and I was on my medication. But today, I'm just fucking miserable. I didn't take my meds, it's grey and rainy, I just want to go to my apartment and play some music on my turntables but I don't even have a counterweight for one of them. Times like this, I think it would just be easier to kill myself and not have to care about anything else. Pittsburgh is really making me start to hate being alive in America. It's so repressive. I can't even be myself here without people taking it the wrong way, viewing me as some rabbelrouser, or just not even giving me a chance cause I'm not a carbon copy of every other person here.",1

559,"Suicide needs to end. Please read this. Mental imbalance is about as acceptable as herpes. It’s never going to be accepted. But really, it’s a disease just like cancer. It just happens, and eats away all the good parts of your brain, like judgment, and happiness, and perception, and memory, and life. And you can die from depression just like any other disease. And it’s not as if people choose it. So why is it still a joke of medicine. ‘She died of cancer’ is a lot more socially acceptable to people than ‘She committed suicide.’ Why? Why is that? Someone please, just this once, answer me. Why is it unacceptable for a person to hurt so badly on the inside that it becomes unbearable? Why is that not as serious as something physically wrong? In my opinion, something mentally and emotionally wrong is much more painful and acceptable than cancer or any other physical ailment. Cancer can be treated, depression stays with you. Yes, you can take medicine to help it, but does that really help it? No. It just clouds your mind from the reality of what's actually going on. It causes you to appear more stable and accepting of life. Newsflash people, we live in a fucked up world. If you didn't feel the slightest bit of depression, anger, pain, guilt, disappointment, then you wouldn't be human. And if people continue to judge others by not wanting to be here any longer, then it's never going to stop. Look around you, take a look in the mirror, anything. Just open your fucking eyes. Things are not okay right now, to say the least. And they seem to be getting worse day by day. Suicide is real. Suicide is here. And.. Suicide is preventable.",0

563,"Haven't been on here in over 2 years....but found myself needing it right now :( Hi, It's been ages since I found myself needing TTL and I hope that I can find some comfort and support even though I haven't been around to give it in return. Facebook is all the rage right now, and I like most people have an account. There is a guy that I have been in love with for over 10 years. It is a long and twisted story. It started as an affair, a very long distance affair. Then he moved to my city. Eventually she left him and he came running to me. I was thrilled. I had always been under the delusion that having him as a friend was better than having nothing. We picked up right away as we had left off as lovers and friends. He was spending 5-6 evenings a week at my house with my 3 year old DS. He was also spending the night on weekends. He suffers from SAD, and his wife leaving him and basically telling him he was worthless sent him spiraling into a deep depression. But as I had always been in the past, I was right there for him believing that my dreams were finally coming true. This went on for many months. Then he kind of withdrew from me, blaming long hours at work. We still were talking and texting, but I hadn't actually seen him in months. He never told me that anything had changed. Well today on Facebook I had a notification about him. I clicked it as I would with any of my friends. I see a post from another girl saying that she had posted on her BF's page...there it was...bigger than all get out...the post that she had mentioned on his wall. Needless to say I am finding myself devestated right now. I was to cry, but my DS is right here. I want to SI, but again, my DS is right here. We were just texting a few days ago and he was talking about coming over to visit. WTF!!! I need help! I know that the most common response is that I was just a rebound person, to let it go. But I feel like he was/is leading me on and it is killing me. I have loved him with all of my heart for so long that unless he flat out tells me....I continue to delude myself into believing that there is hope. All along my therapist and case manager have been afraid that I was going to get hurt....now months later, here I am hurt. I really hope that someone reads this, because I am falling apart on the inside right now. I need to talk. I need support. I need help. I feel bad for coming back here and asking for help after being away for so long. So, please forgive my absense and don't hold it against me. ~WoundedHeart",1
564,"My family would think it was great if I died So often I've read here ""I can't commit suicide because it would hurt my parents"" or my family so much. I really can't even imagine that. First of all, I am in the fifties and don't have a family of my own. So there is nobody who would even miss me or think it was there job to bury me. But the only family I do have, my family of origin, hate me and treat me like absolute garbage. Well, not my mom. She is elderly and lives with my sister. My sister went on vacation so my mom is alone. I called my mom and said I would go come down just for the day yesterday to visit her. My niece came over and found out and said I was not allowed under my sister's roof. My sister hates me. No reason given. She smiles in your face, sharpens a knife behind your back. My mom is lonely. I called both my nieces who were dropping in on my mom and neither one would return my phone calls. I called my mom again and said are they going to call the police if I visit you? Then my sister lied and said she never said it, but she did, and she just makes everything worse by lying about lying. A lot of stuff has happened between my sister and I that nobody knows about- she is abusive and manipulative. Anyway nobody knows my side of anythng and they are all afraid to offend her. So I am locked out of everything. And this weekend I could not even visit my mother. I honestly think if I killed myself they would be disgusted and not bother to even bury me. They hate me and don't even talk to me. I never did anything to deserve this. And right now I wish I were dead. I am so depressed I am in physical pain and exhausted. I hate my sister for being so cruel. I would like to never have to deal with her again. I would like my life to be over now. OO",1
565,Confused I've been concerned with how I've been feeling for years but I've never discussed my feelings with anyone because I'm scared. Just writing this post is making me anxious and uncomfortable but I think it's a good first step to help deal with what's going on. This past week I've been feeling really suicidal. I'm actually surprised that I haven't done anything yet. My thoughts are beginning to scare me and I'm scared that I'm just going to give up trying. I've felt this way before but I've managed to work through it but this time feels different somehow. I don't really know how to seek help for what's going on and I feel like things are not going to improve any time soon. There's only so many times one can say things will improve and actually believe that it's going to happen. I've been tempted to go to the emergency room but I'm scared. Just thinking about it I can feel my anxiety levels rise and my heart pounding in my chest. I also have so many things coming up and so many things to do that I can't imagine what would happen if I would have to stay in the hospital for any length of time. I also don't know if I can actually muster the courage to tell someone that I'm not fine and I need help. I don't want to kill myself but I do and it's beginning to feel like more and more of a good idea every day. I'm feeling awful and so confused that I'm not sure what to do anymore. I'm a 21 year old female and I live in Canada. I don't really have anyone to talk to about this in real life so any advice would be extremely appreciated. Thank you!,1
566,"Do you cry much? I think crying is of vital importance if you seriously do want to help yourself. It can be very difficult to let it all out and talking to professional people just seems too... official, emotionless and forced. But speaking as someone whose been standing on cliffs for the past 18 months and staying around simply because I didn't have the courage to jump, it's incredibly therapeutic and the best possible release to let it all out, either on your own or with someone who has genuinely been there.",1
567,Emptiness. I have no friends. Can't talk to girls. I don't even think i want to talk to people. I don't see any point in living. I'm just thinking about suicide and how comfortable it sounds but i'm definitely not going to do it.,1
568,"What is going on Things are good. I am drug and alcohol free and making plans for the future. I don't feel 'depressed' right now, which is a really good thing. I have a sense of purpose. BUT I consider suicide on a daily basis. Spontaneously. Rapidly. It is hard to not feel overwhelmed by these sudden urges. There are methods all around me every single day and it physically pains me to keep myself in check. I use to get similar feelings when I was younger but they were not self harm but outward harm where I would drift off into daydreams and see myself harming entire rooms full of people. It became so bad that a few times I actually thought I had gone through with it. There was literally no line between reality and fantasy. These episodes would usually be followed by shear panic and utmost distress. Sometimes I would pass out. What I feel now is almost exactly the same but I see myself committing suicide. It isn't as graphically detailed, or as distressing, nor have I passed out. I am fearful of what will happen if I open up to a counsellor, or mental health worker. Is this insanity? I feel even further isolated because I have never heard anyone expressing these kinds of thoughts/feelings. Does anyone else experience this? Can anyone offer advice? Thank you in advance.",0
569,"Perhaps I don't want to kill myself after all. . . I was thinking during another low point in my mental (vocabulary's shit, not even gonna try anymore) process of depression, and I sort of came to a realization that I might not want to die. I might just want to convince everyone else in the world that I do in fact deserve to die. I was going through the infinitely long (and steadily growing) list of reasons why I should kill myself, and I had an epiphany: All the depressed people out there feel sorry for themselves constantly. I don't really feel sorry for myself. I think that I deserve all of this, as I know exactly what my faults are and just won't fix them. I am a walking zombie (that covers laziness). I am stupid beyond the point of reason. Physically I am weak and unattractive. All of this stuff that is just getting worse points towards the obvious direction of suicide, but the thing is, I can't/won't do it. Any rational person would rid the world of their presence if they were the way I am. There are literally no redeemable qualities. I think that, without consciously realizing it, my entire purpose as a human being is to convince others that I should be dead. I don't know what the point of it is, but that's just how it is.",0
570,"What if... Hey friends.... First of all, sorry for all the spelling mistakes I might make... I'm from Denmark, but I'll try my best in english... Well, I think many of you maybe have thought about the queston ""what if I just was gone?"" and ""What would happen then?""... I do... year, I have thought about it a lot, for a while now... ""who will cry? and who will care? Who will honestly miss you"".... I have to say, that I'm not an unpopular girl, actually I have pretty many ""friends"".. or so the rest of the world think... the fact is, that I only think I have 1 real friend... He's name is Jakob... I think he might be the only one, who really gonna miss me, besides my family... Have you guys ever read or seen the story about Hazel Grace, ""The Fault in Our Stars""? There is a guy, in the book, who says something like: everybody will be forgotten at some time, and someday you'll be not on any mind anymore... you'll just end up like nothing.... And I think the author, John Green, is right.... at the end I maybe don't matter to anyone... Not even my family... they'll get over it at a time... I am crying myself into sleep, but still smiling to the world, maybe even more than all they other people, just to be sure, that they wont see through me.... I really don't think anyone will miss me that much... the few ones, who will miss me, like my family and Jakob, have a lot of other ""friends"".... year, I think they will cry, but they'll also get over it... Sorry for this depressing post, but I just have to come out with it somewhere.... it's late now... over midnight, but I'm not tired... but I have to make myself fall in sleep now, so I can wake up tomorrow, and make sure everything seems normal....",0
571,"feeling extremely low I am feeling so extremely low right now and am hating every single aspect about myself and feeling worthless. apparently I've been doing a good job and people have been thinking I'm doing much better. but that's cos I get tired of people continually asking how I am and me always having to say that I'm not doing too good so I say I'm ok now instead. No one sees how bad it really is. I plan things out in my mind ways to go. I feel like I'm trapped in limbo where I don't want to live but am not sure if I want to die either but most of my thoughts centre around death and not having to be here any more. I feel like there's nothing left for me to give and this world is too harsh and cruel. I'm just not coping with life right now and I'm not sure where to turn. I don't want to call a mental health line and find ways to ""be safe"" or get asked what do I usually do to make myself feel safe? The answer is nothing makes me feel safe. I'm trapped in my head with no way out. And the worst part is I don't want people to see me like this or have to deal with me. So my front that's cracking slightly is fixed in place. I suppose anyone reading this would think what a loser she's so self absorbed. Maybe I am but it still doesn't stop these feelings. Like knives that cut through my soul. Feeling like I live a dead existence and I die a little each day inside. I'm really sorry for anyone reading this.",1
572,"My Story: My Mother Thanks for taking the time to read today, I am currently in High School, an aspiring musician, for the past several years I have been bullied and battled depression and I have been seen visibly sad, sometimes I would be crying in my room or under the kitchen table, especially now, and most of the times I cannot give a reason why because I knew she wouldn't understand. I knew because I brought this problem up before and when I talk about my problems, she makes it worse by telling me that I am making up my own problems. Because of this, I cannot tell my mom about my problems and try my best not to cry about my problems in front of my mother. In High School, I can barely keep up in class, especially in the beginning when grades have a hard time getting off the ground and every night I stay up late doing my homework and the next morning waking up with massive sleep deprivation and my mother doesn't stop badgering me about it. My mother holds me up to high expectations that I cannot meet. In times when I cannot meet up to other's expectations I meet scathing criticism and I just can't take it sometimes and it makes me want to cry but I know that I cannot. I know that I perform terribly in academics, or at least I am led to believe that because my mother doesn't believe I am doing good enough and at this rate, she'll never give me her approval. She pressures me into pursuing a musical career because she invested many years of her life to pushing me. But I am not a good musician, and when I fail, she always plays on my guilt despite my best efforts. I have no social life, no friends, and I always get sad when other people are enjoying themselves with their friends, nobody cares about me, everybody hates me, nobody understands my problems. Ever since last summer, I wanted to kill myself because things were only about to get harder especially when I have to deal with all of my problems at once and I wanted to avoid the transition into the next school year. I want my mom to comfort me for once instead of making my problems even worse. I don't want to bear the pain of my daily criticism and spending this time feeling sorry and sad for my shortcomings. I remain somewhat skeptical about killing myself because I know that I can have a better life if I can somehow pull through but it is just a question of ""how much can I take before I break down?"" My mother is overly strong, and unlike her, I am not that strong, I cannot see myself pulling myself through this. My mother also has too much hope in people, she sees strength in people even when it isn't there. I have no strength, I don't want to live in this hard world. All of this wouldn't be as hard if my mother didn't have to make it worse every time. If I do kill myself, I can take peace in the fact that she will reflect on her choices while underneath a mountain of debt. She'll know how it feels be live under unbearable expectations and inexplicable sadness. Again thank you for taking the time to read this post. I know, it may be hard for you to relate, but find it in your heart to not be too condemning of my story. This is the only place where I can speak about my problems without other people trying to get me ""help"" but instead botches up my future. Despite my situations with my mother, she may be the only person who can help me become who I want to be.",1
573,"I do not want to be here anymore I hope you all can bear with me as I'm not very articulate and have trouble describing my situation much of the time. Basically, I've somewhat recently decided that I plan to kill myself. I suppose I have to mention that this is not a note. I decided a while ago yet am still around now, just sorting some last things out, so clearly I'm in no rush. Everything has just become too painful. My life has deteriorated to nothing. I sit in bed all day. I don't do anything anymore, nor do I have the will to. My eating schedule is thrown off, my memory is in shambles, I dropped out of school, and I don't communicate with anyone, even the people living in the same house as me. All my life I have been depressed, but it's finally culminated and I am finally finished. I've considered many things: reasons for staying, strategies for overcoming depression, the consequences of what I would do. But none of it has made any difference for me. And then I stumbled on this site. So I thought I would come here and share and see if any of you have anything to say about this. I don't expect anyone to change my mind and that should not be your goal if you respond, it will likely just make me mad. Just say what you think. I don't care if its happy, sad, supportive, questioning, disagreement, anything. I am here while I wait just trying to gather all the viewpoints possible. I also suppose talking this out may help me, though again I find it very unlikely.",1
574,"Cant get them out Hello im new here. And...I just need to talk about things with someone, hopefully i'll gain some insight here. Here's my story, im 22. I've always suffered from alot of panic attacks, and then later on in my puberty depression followed. I've also had psychosis problems, which made really angry and then i break down and cry. I have suicide thoughts everyday, 2 years back i tried to kill myself (That failed obviously.) I had to go to the hospital. But the suicide attempt only made it worse, today im afraid that i might impulsively kill myself. I want to have a good life, with love and maybe some moeny. But i also want to do my dream which is music. My girlfriend wants to leave me, she says i drag her down. That im a depressive guy, before she met me she was feeling fine. ( I dot know, i tried my best to be a good boyfriend.) She has lost her feelings for me, and there is no sex left in the relationship. Just ackwardness, and i dont even feel for her sometimes. I dont know what to do regarding that either. But that just makes me want to kill myself even more. She said she's afraid to leave me so i dont kill myself. I promised her i wouldnt. But these suicide thoughts just keep on creeping in. I cant sleep at night because im paranoid, of spirits and aliens and whatnot. I got no education, i got no money. Can barely afford to eat. I've tried pills, they fucked me up. I've tried psychologists and programs etc....still doesnt change anything. Im beginning to feel like a wasted life, that this shit will never get better. I will always be alien to myself and others. And sometimes it just seems easier to kill myself. What the fu*k can I do to improve my life? How can I find love? Where will I get money? Where will I find happiness? Is it even worth it? Everyone else seem like they're depressed to, just trying to ignore it. Like som sort of escapism. The idea of suicide just keeps coming, and i feel on the edge. BEcause theres a part of me that wants to live, but it isnt strong enough. I also get these memories, flashing in my head like 1-3 seconds. All the painful memories.... I need some fucking help! :(",1
575,"I'm done... I'm only 17 years old, and I've been wanting to kill myself since I was 16. Now that is sad. What kind of teen/kid even should be thinking about harming themselves. I believe God put us here on this world for a reason. And we are wanting to take our lifes, it's just not fare. But I honestly can't take it no more. Every time I'm alone which is when I'm at home. I get really depressed and start thinking of the past, and it just hurts. I wish I could talk to someone. I told my mother that I wanted depressing pills but she told me I didn't need them, because my brother was wanting to kill himself at my age too but he didn't. She is the worst mother ever she doesn't even try and find out what is wrong with me or anything. I mean if my kids had the guts to tell me that there life wasn't good and they didn't feel like living anymore I would hear them out. I wouldn't just let leave them harming themselves because that would just hurts me. I'll just say everything here since I won't and never will have anyone else to talk to like this. I don't think I deserve to leave because my life has been fucked up ever since day one. My mom was never really a mother and well my father was even worse. I get attracted or become friends with the wrong people -- nevermind I don't even think I can do this because I'm scared of one of my friends finding out about this article. I don't know maybe when I turn 18, I can save up enough money and talk to someone about my problems. I just hope I don't do anything stupid from here and now on.",1
576,"suicide is too complicated i can't really kill myself, it's been way too long time being told how mean it is and how sad my family and friends will be so i just can't, when i'm too bad i just get stuck sitting in a corner instead or something like that, but seriously, i want to stop this.. living. and the longer time i go on and live, the more convinced i get that my life is going to suck forever and that still i can't kill myself. i want to get away, dunno where but since i can't die then just anything else i guess, just want to disapear and don't have any responsabilities just be left alone to waste my life until everyone has forgotten me so i can die without anyone bothering. don't feel like speaking, yet i want to be around people, listen to them and watch them but not tell them anything or laugh at what they say, just be outside becuz it's not worth it, even the people i am close to feels like they're very far away and i just always act, know what they want and try to be that, it's just very confusing, to know what i am like becuz i don't think i really am anything, when i'm alone and don't have to act or anything, i just lie in my bed and stare at the walls and try not to think about everything i have to go to become a more successful person, try to forget that there's always something i could do to become better, prettier, smarter, and that i don't have any time for just selfharming and feeling sorry for myself and freaking out.. i am never ever happy about anything, i try to think how happy i am to have a nice mom and a nice friend and food and everything but instead i always end up thinking that i could have known more about history and i could have had prettier clothes and i could have had a more wellpaid job and i could be better in school and i could be able to play more instruments ect .. but when it comes to what i really want, i just want someone who loves me and who isn't mad at for everything, but no one can stand being in a relationship with me so i try and be perfect in all other ways, but i don't have time and soon it'll be too late and i should just die now so i don't get time to realise i have failed. i just want to get my own appartment, without any windows or other irritating shit things and then just crash on the floor and ignore all people becuz there's no one who can help me or understand, everyone goes away, i want to give up on this whole being-a-social-person thing, feels like i am all alone even if i am not and who the hell will care anyways.... wish suicide would have been just so easy to just die and not have all these problems about everyone and everything.

579,"Becoming suicidal completely changed my perception I've been depressed in the past, but I always held out hope for the future. Lately though I can't say that hope is still there. More and more I feel backed into a corner without any options. Medication is helping, but the hopelessness is still there about the future. The worst thing is all the realizations I've come to have and my perception of the world flipped upside down. I find myself wondering about death more and more. I also question any afterlife now which I had always believed there was something in the past. But the more I live with this altered perception the more tormented I feel. I see everything in a dark way now. I see no good left in the world. I see pain. Happiness and joy seem like nothing more than meaningless passing emotions. The purpose of life has been questioned. I see now why some people commit suicide and it's a frightening reality. I know how I was before this and I feel like I'll never be able to find that side of me again. Maybe it's just me getting older, but there's the depression too. The scary thought that nobody is going to come save us from ourselves. And this is it, once your dead it's just like you were before you were born. That's scary as well. I hope I can feel joy again one day.",1

This haunts me on a daily basis. Thanks to the bitterness of my creation my parents maintained a negative and aggressively angry environment for our family. I've finally come out of my denial and now that I realize all of this an uncontrollable monster has erupted out of me.

I'm convinced that I'm a poison, my existence is a poison, and I should therefore just put an end to it. The longer I continue to prolong things and continue to live the longer my life bears negative consequences to the world. There is no need for more chances. I have had hundreds of chances. By continuing to live I am wasting precious time, space, money, and resources that could be used by people who are much worthier. There needs to be societal customs that encourage suicide for people like me. Everything will be better when I'm no longer sickening the world with my existence. Don't think I'm being too hard on myself. Trust me, what I've said here makes my failures look like successes. This is only the tip of the iceburg. I cannot be forgiven or allowed to live any longer. I want to commit suicide. Maybe my suicide will be the only thing I did right. I know when I'm gone everything will be better. We sell ourselves this lie that ""every life is precious"". Nope, not true. My life isn't. My life should be eradicated at all costs. Its just fortunate that I recognize this fact.",1

EVER! everyone on here wants to get better. i DONT want to get better and i WANT to stay suicidal, and i WANT to die. and i deserve punishment for that. because when i kill myself, God will hate me and he should. if there is no God well, i guess we see nothing and that just makes life even more meaningless. im hurting, but not even close to bad enough to kill myself over. especially when i have had things good and have a future because im only 20. but thats too old. 20 is too long for me. everyone here should be disgusted with me. i dont even know why im posting this shit. my therapist made me promise i wouldnt do anything to myself before my next appointment which is next tuesday. but if she makes me promise it again, i wont do it. because my time is near and death is calling my name. i dont care how my family and friends will hurt because im just that much more of an evil satanic piece of fucking shit. fuck me.",1

About how the two primary people I ask 90% of self my loathing questions probably find me annoying at this point. Or how I seem to be sensitive. About how all the concerns of being close to people and having them stab me in the back. About the concerns of shitty social rules, about double standards. About how certain people have it easier. About how anyone crazy enough to like me must be insane or stupid, because I do not have any qualities anyone would find attractive, unless they were under the influence of something.

606,Terrified screwup Hi everyone. I've been hospitalized once for a suicide attempt bit have had several other attempts before and after that. I received a diagnosis of bipolar I which seems to explain a lot but what makes me sick is the possibility that I hide behind my bipolar as a way to explain whatever messed up things I've done. Maybe it's all in my head and I'm just the f**kup I'm convinced that I am. I spend most of my time making myself sick over the things I wish I could be as well as obsessing over times in the past in convinced were better. And they were. In my head I see myself as a better person and not the despicable person I see in the mirror everyday. I really am such a screwup and I seriously just think that myself and everyone else would be better off moving past the mess that I am. The only thing that keeps me going is my girlfriend. She saves my life every day. But she is the most wonderful person I've ever known and I just dread the day she wakes up and realizes all the grief that I cause her and everyone else. I'm just not worth it. I just can't see any other options and I feel like I did the day I made the attempt that landed me in the hospital. I guess because I'm posting this there is a part of me that wants to live but that part is getting smaller every day. Thanks everyone for your time. J,1

608,"Thats Me? What Happened? I started cutting when I was about 11 years old, and its now been 9 years. Wow, how time goes by. I remember that first time like it was yesterday. A few of my friends had started doin it so I thought that would try it to. It hurt so much and I couldnt understand why people did it. My boyfriend at the time got so mad at me, but thats what ended the fight that we were in. After a few months the craze of cutting yourself had passed amungst my friends and no one was doin it anymore, no one that is except for me. I started out din it on my thighs, then ran out of room, and it all went to shit from there. Now I wont leave my house without long pants and long sleeves on, even in the summer when it hits the 90s and 100s. I remeber my exboyfriend getting so mad at me for cutting and telling me that if he saw anymore cuts on me that we were through. So I thought, ""no biggy, Ill jus do it where you cant see it."" So I started cuttin my feet, yea tell me about it. I went to a residential and the staff there were actually scared of me. They later told me that they had never seen someone with so many scars on their body. They all had to attend special classes to learn how to deal with cutters. I am sad to say, that when I look at myself in the mirror the cuts overwhelm me. I see them and think, ""why did I ever do that to myself?"" But them 20 minutes later there I am with a razor in hand repeating the past. I honestly thought that by the time I got to be this age that this ""phase"" would be behind me, but I guess not. I guess Im writing this to reach out and actually ASK for some help something Ive never been able to do before in my whole life. I dont want to have to some day explain to my kids why mommy has nasty scars all over her body. If there is anyone out there who has cut, has stopped cutting, or still does cut, and can give me some insight and hope for myself it would be more than appreciated.",1

In all honesty i haven't tried my hardest, I am ashamed of what i have become. On a daily basis i get an adrenaline rush and dream of sorting all this stuff out and settling down with a woman and having a family, it feels all positive until the doubt, fear emotions settle in and i feel like the suicide is necessary to prevent it ever happening in the future especially in front of a partner or even worse a child.

I have a CPN who visits once a month for ""psychosocial counseling"" He thinks I'm malingering. My dad hit me when I was about six y o, I only rememberd about that last year when I was digging deep in my mind to try and find why I'm not right. I had blanked that out for over 48 years, I couldnt hear anything for a week, and I get chronic earache. In 2002 I was diagnosed with chronic stress, anxiety, depression and panic attacks, My most recent panic attack was on monday. I saw the CPN yesterday,(routine monthly) I think I'm Bi-polar, and autistic, I have done online tests which indicate so. But never diagnosed by a doc IRL. On saturday night, I was visited by a radiant angel, The angel came into my mind like a vision, The angel told me to ""fight for the truth"", Three times the angel said; ""fight for the truth"", I felt joy at this, but now I feel so depressed that I feel like I want to burn down the house, to move on to the next parallel. But the angel has told me I have to fight for the truth. How can I make anyone believe me if I have to fight for it. I'm a pacifist I hate fights and violence. I have so much to give, but I cant get anyone to listen, samaritans and breathing space hung up on me, the citizens advice bureau have banned me for no reason, The CPN is only interested in me filling in a ""how are we doing feedback evaluation form"". Please dont ask me for anything which may reveal my ID, as I have been attacked and am on a death list by some ex army gang. They have hacked my broadband and stolen my identity and spammed the world to make everyone hate me, This has placed me on many internet blacklists so I am cut off and isolated. Although the hack took place in 2010 I only discovered this a couple of months ago. I could type volumes about all the bad stuff, beatings, false allegations, attempted murder, high speed car crashes, falling off oilrigs, but it wont help really, So, one hour contact with a cpn in a month, thats it. That's my life. I have to go do an errand, I'll be back on later. thanks :)",1

I've never been able to keep friends and am always fascinated and stupefied at how other people seem to so easily have large groups of friends, and even romantic partners!! I'm currently in graduate/professional school and am always surrounded by happy, outgoing people that are a part of a great community that I just don't feel very welcome in. When I am with people, I seem to either not speak enough (and come across as bored and disinterested or just boring, and am not invited back) or I get too comfortable and speak too much (and come across as annoying and maybe like the socially awkward kid who never had many friends in high school and is way too excited, which is accurate, and am not invited back). I've always wished I could die easily, like before waking up, but I think I'm too scared to actually kill myself. I'm trying to think of more reasons to want to continue living that don't have to do with friends or significant others, because I honestly don't see much of that in my future because honestly, I wouldn't want to be friends with me either! Yes I have family that loves me but it's just not the same. And yes I have pets but they kind of suck. I can barely take care of myself and it's a lot of work to take care of them too and it's draining since they are not affectionate pets (birds and a snake).

I am quite unemotional as I type this. I can not abate the conviction that I am NOTHING. It has been with me my whole life and it is immutable. I have nothing to offer, nothing to capitalize on, and thoughts of suicide occur daily. I honestly do not wish to live. I am also prematurely agonizing over aging; I can not remove from my mind the impression that a woman's worth is determined by her sexual value. Also, I suffer intensely because my split bisexual brain makes me feel the need to live up to the expectations of manhood and womanhood so my sense of failure is doubled.

625,"suicidal again There are many things I'm just plain tired of. The constant yelling and fighting between my 12 yr old and my wife is what makes me want to do it. The more I have to listen to it the more I get closer to actually finishing what I want to do. I figure they can have the life insurance and they can't fight all they friggin want to and I won't have to hear it anymore. There are many things I've come to terms with. Suicide is the ultimate sin that you can't ask forgiveness for. Eternal hell. I'm ok with that. It doesn't bother me so much like it has in the past. Last time the urge got so bad I actually did get help. They wanted me to check in to some inpatient facility but I told them I wasn't about to be strapped to some bed all day long. So they put me on an anti-psychotic. Well a lot of good that does. My body metabolizes medications so fast and I have to take it at night because it makes me sleepy that I don't think there's any of it in my system by morning. Things that will knock most people on their butt I have to take a large amount of to work. But that's not the way I want to go. There is a risk of rescue that I think isn't worthwhile. I'm not ""reaching out for help"" because I believe one of these nights the yelling and fighting will push me too far and the overwhelming urge to remove myself will be more than I can stand. It's a daily thing and in all honesty I can't believe it hasn't happened yet. One time the therapist asked why I don't just leave and move out. I don't know how many of you work crappy government jobs and make next to nothing but seriously...where would I go. Move out only to be alone? I can do that now by removing myself. For now the urge has subsided because the yelling and the fighting have stopped. But it will be back tomorrow. It always is. I wish I could say I was able to fight it but it really does get stronger every day. I can picture it and it just doesn't bother me. And really...maybe it will be the ultimate revenge. I've been tortured for so long by this nonsense maybe it's time to let someone else be tortured for once. Because frankly I'm too old and tired to put up with this nonsense every single day. The funny part is I even asked my wife to go to the therapist to learn techniques for dealing with our oldest who has ADHD and she just can't seem to be bothered. I guess she's happy with all the carrying on. But I'm certainly not.",1

She's living with her aunt currently and her aunt keeps telling her how she'll just turn out like them. So today she goes around telling quite a lot of people how she tried to overdose on adderall (she takes it for ADHD) She told me she took four pills Saturday and was throwing up all day. Then she tells me about how she's planning on doing it this Saturday. The hardest thing is she told my friends and I if we tell an adult she will kill herself right there and then. I don't know what to do. If I don't do anything (anything being telling an adult to get help) she might do it, but if I do tell an adult she might kill herself. Some people thing she's doing for attention because a) she's done this before b) why would you tell literally everyone ""I'm such a failure I can't even kill myself right"" c) if she really did want to kill herself why didn't she take the whole bottle etc etc I personally don't believe these thing, but at this point if hope its the truth.

633,"My friend is suicidal, and obsessive. I have no clue what to do.Hello, I have a friend who i play videogames with very often. A while ago he told me he liked me, and i had no problem with that, though i’m not a very commitment oriented person (unlike him i think) Then a few months ago he told me he loves me and he was feeling a little sad, then sadness very quickly spiraled into a dark depression. I asked him why/when he thinks it started and he just simply said “the day i met you”. *At this point we were talking literally everyday. *ALSO* our situation is very odd we met over an online game and he’s kinda a loner and he would text me a lot over playstation (like almost a year 1/2 ago when we met) and then eventually i gave him my snapchat. He’s about year younger than me so i thought maybe it was just a harmless crush. We’re not adults, and he said to me he wants to marry me. I care about him wholeheartedly and love him as a friend he is really smart but now he’s stopped going to school. I know some of his friends but he doesn’t tell them anything about his depression and no one really knows except for me and i’m five states away from him btw. He told me he went to the doctor with his parents and his doctor recommended him a psychiatrist. He then proceeded to tell me he has severe anxiety about the doctors finding out where his depression stemmed from. At this point i am so lost and emotionally drained from this boy. I’ve considered just cutting him off (and i’ve tried) numerous times but then his one OTHER friend(2) that actually lives near him will text me saying that friend 1 is trying to kill himself and he needs me. My personal life is falling apart and my own depression and anger is getting worse. This kid keeps me up UNTIL 4:30 AM!!!! He gets immensely worse when i do fall asleep on him. I take multiple medications because of my own mental health issues. One being Seroquel (i forget what the actual name is but that’s the brand) and that’s supposed to help me calm myself when off them i usually can’t. So when i take them before bed they are supposed to calm me for sleep and i’ve had only 4 hours of sleep in the past week. I have a life outside of my phone and my game console and him. I’ve stopped eating. It’s hard to get out of bed in the morning. I feel i am losing my mind. He’s cut himself and has tried to OD but he threw the pills up. He tells me he trembles and shakes when i hang up. He pukes all the time when i’m on the phone with him. And he cries ALL. THE. TIME. I HAVE ENOUGH GODDAMN FUCKING PROBLEMS OF MY OWN AND IM STUCK LISTENING TO HIS WHINING TWENTY FOUR FUCKING SEVEN. I CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE. HE TELLS ME HE CANT LIVE WITHOUT ME. I cry when i think about him. He was my closest friend for a while. If i had a magic wand i really would wish the best for him. He’s a bright kid that’s so naive. I’m not the only fish in the sea. I really liked this kid. I miss him. When he wasn’t a leech. I’ve tried everything i know. I’ve been in and out of facilities and programs myself i’ve tried to teach him what i’ve learned. I tried to care, but i’ve become so numb to this kid now. “You’re the death of me” he tells me. Why me? Why can’t i just leave? I know if i do i’ll have his death on my shoulders for the rest of my life. please no. someone please help me. i’m in so much pain. and i feel so trapped. s sorry if this got messy i feel physically ill right now. edit: this is probably really offensive or triggering but i just felt so much hate inside of me near the end.

I guess after all this rambelling my question is this how could you help a person who is not interested in helping themselves i thought i could just ignore her and show her that people around her wont care if she doesn't but i am afraid she'll end her life if she feels pressure from people close to her.

While he plays it off as a joke, as someone who knows him it's really not. Behind the funny low self-esteem posts and jokes, our late night messages show how he really feels about himself; he believes he has no worth and no one loves him, he feels like a failure to his family and friends, that he doesn't deserve anything because he's useless. Over the last two weeks it's been getting worse -- distancing himself from friends, more self-degrading posts, and drawing rather graphic drawings in his free time depicting suffocation and self harm. &#x200B; I've told him that I care about him; that his friends and family care about him and we're here for him. That he is worth every bit of time we dedicate to him, that he is useful no matter what he may think, and so much more. However, he seems to look past those reassurance and instead focuses on his negative thoughts. I've sent him the teen hotline, but i don't know if he's used it. His self-destructive behavior is starting to scare me, and, as someone who's been in a similar place as him and has taking the darker route, I'm beginning to worry that he may be having darker thoughts; that he has/is considering self harm, or that he is considering suicide. &#x200B; I don't know what else to do, or what I even *can* do.

She stayed with my family and I last Christmas and also came to visit me in college for a couple of weeks. We talk on the phone a lot, but I am starting to worry about her. The last time we were on the phone she mentioned to me that she cuts herself. She has mentioned this before, but during this call it was different. She was laughing about it like practically bragging. She even told me that she brought what she uses to cut herself to my apartment and did it while she stayed with me. I can’t imagine why someone would say something like that as if it was no big deal. As I am someone who has gone through mental health issues and is currently in recovery, I am constantly trying to encourage her to seek help and tell her that certain behaviors are unhealthy but I am getting nowhere. I am thinking that it is time to tell someone in her family, but I don’t know if that’s too far. She has gone to therapy before, but her parents don’t know the severity of what’s going on so they took her out and she’s not on her meds.

She’s 19, but she still lives with her family. I have no way to contact her parents or siblings other than finding their social media or something and messaging them, but I feel that might be too far.

From what she tells me, her parents spoil her to make her love them; she is constantly stressed about school and is failing almost everything; She has a traumatic past, almost being raped; being harassed and bullied to the point of when she goes back to or even near her last school she starts balling, I've been with her when it happens too and she couldn't move she was so upset; she has cut herself and just told me she did it again after 2 months. Point is, she is definitely not okay. I told her to get a therapist, to tell other people and she did. She actually listened to me and it was okay for awhile. But she got attached, like really attached and I didn't feel the same. She wanted to have sex with me and was serious to me about it. You might think im bullshitting that, considering im 15. But unlike every other fucking horny teen, I don't want to have sex just to have sex. I want to with someone I like and someone Im attracted to which im not to her. But ever since I've said no she has been worse. She did get a therapist, but tells her almost nothing. She thinks she will put her in a mental hospital. And honestly, it doesn't sound too farfetched. I don't know what to do. I'm the only one she tells things to and if I tell someone she'll know its me. She might be put into a mental hospital, and im worried she might be pushed over the edge.

650,"My friend is suicidal drinks herself to sleep and gets high to forget about her horrible familyMy friend (let's call her Isabella) and I are both freshman​ in high school. We met earlier in the year through a mutual friend and started becoming close friends. I only started to find out how bad her life was as of four weeks ago. I don't know when it started but on multiple occasions Isabella had been raped by her 20+ year old stepbrother (SB) who's twice the size of her and absolutely terrifies her. One time she got drunk and high and woke up in her SB's bed, needless to say she broke down immediately. Tonight she told me that her SB would buy her pregnancy tests and force her to take them. One of them came up positive so at 14 years old he forced her to take abortion pills. She lives in fear now, when a certain song plays she starts crying, when she smells cologne she gets a panic attack, and she doesn't trust men anymore. I think I'm the only guy she trusts. CPS was called so she's safe now, from her SB at least, because every night I go to sleep wondering if she's taking a handful of pills, and every morning I wake up desperately waiting for a text message to tell me she's still alive. Tonight she also told me that the night before she started to overdose on Tylenol but only stopped because she wouldn't want me to blame myself if she died. But what makes me sick is how her family treats her. Her mom and stepsister actually blame her for everything, they said ""You wanted your SB to get in trouble so you let him rape you"" and she's starting to believe them. Her dad hears all of this and does nothing, won't even mention what happened so now she thinks he blames her too.",0

She pushes me away and says I only talk to her because I’m lonely and she’s a burden to everyone, which is so not true and it hurts that she thinks I don’t value her friendship. I feel awful saying this but it’s exhausting and frustrating trying to support her, especially because it feels like nothing I do can help. I texted her mom to let her know that my friend is saying she wants to die... but I don’t know what to do anymore. I really don’t think she will do anything because her family had to shell out so much money for her treatment and she would feel incredibly guilty. I feel like a bad friend for not knowing what to do, does anyone have any advice? I think I’m taking this all way to personally and my intentions are about trying to help her.",0
652,My friend is suicidalI don’t know what to do anymore I’m sorry if this post is just rambling. About once a month I have to talk my friend out of suicide and every week I counsel her through depressive episodes and anxiety attacks. She already has a therapist but needs support from me to get through her illness. I just don’t know if I can do it myself but I have to. It destroys me every single time and I constantly feel so weak and sad and anxious at every point of the day now thinking about if she were to actually kill herself. Even at happy moments and completely unrelated moments throughout the day it’s constantly in the back of my mind. I can’t get rid of it. It’s like I’m obsessed. I feel so sick but if I don’t deal with her I think she’ll actually do it. I tell her to get professional help and I direct her to hotlines and medication possibilities and other people she can go to for support but she still feels awful and I still feel awful. I haven’t talked to her about it because I’m scared that it’ll push her to the edge knowing she’s stressing me out. I’m so stuck. I’m so scared. I don’t know what to do. It’s been like this for a year now. I can’t do this anymore. I consider myself a generally happy person and think I’ve conquered most of my anxiety but this is what’s keeping me from being happy. It makes me feel so so shitty and it’s really the only thing making me feel shitty. I need this gone,0

It's a complicated situation and it's too much to go into in detail. He found someone else, we broke up, 6 months later we agreed to give it another go, 3 weeks in he said he can't deal with a relationship so we are no longer together. Either way I still care about him a lot and I'm worried sick. He's always suffered with his mental health, I'm the five years I've known him. But since we broke up he's been the worst I've ever known. He doesn't eat properly, he's got himself into debt, he drinks heavily most nights to sleep. He told me he's the closest he's ever been to killing himself. He's attempted it once in the past. I don't know what to do. He's been to mind, he's spoken to a few people and is now on the waiting list to see a proper psychiatrist. But he's been on the phone to me breaking down saying he's desperate for help and he needs it now and he can't wait any longer. I thought about the crisis team but he said he's dealt with them in the past, and all they do is help you for a few days then leave you to it. I'm so worried about him. I'm scared about him now living on his own - so I'm talking with him about moving back in, even if it's just until he can get himself set financially and maybe find someone else to live with. I do offer to help him with his debt side of things all the time but he refuses to accept it. If I move in I'm hoping it will take some pressure off him. But when he falls apart I have no idea how to bring him back down or make him feel better. I've never been any good with dealing with people upset and especially not to this degree. I'm depressed and suicidal myself so I just never know what to do it what to say and it all gets a bit much for me, and sometimes I feel I make it worse. I know there are other people that know about this but I don't know if they realise how bad he is. I don't know if telling them will just upset him more because I don't think he wants everyone bringing it up or talking to him about it. I just know how desperate he is for help and I just want to help so badly, but I don't know what to do. Tldr; friend is suicidal. Has seen mind, is on waiting list for a psychiatrist, says the crisis team won't help, and I don't know what to do to help him.",0

Today he came over to my house and gave me a necklace for the girl that she of course declined, he quickly left and after an hour or so he texted me that he's at the academy and by the end of the day he might hang himself.

657,"I'm not sure if my friend is suicidal Hello everyone, I'm hoping that someone more knowledgeable than me can give some advice. I went out to lunch with my friend today, and he just seemed...off. He's kind of a spacey guy, but we generally have really great conversations and feed well off of each other. Today, it seemed as if each of his thoughts was not connected to the next. He would say something, and then it would seem like he completely forgot that he just said that. It was just bizarre. He also was laughing just a little too much, like I would say something kind of mundane and he would laugh way too hard. We have a good joking relationship, but this was out of character. He also started tearing up a couple of times. He was not choked up and didn't break down or anything like that, but his eyes got all welled up. The first time it happened I asked him if he was okay and he was just kind of like ""yeah I'm fine."" I figured it could be allergies or something. It happened again, and, again, I asked him if he was okay. This time he was more like ""yeah man, are you okay?"" Then he asked it again, ""are you okay?"" I wasn't sure if he was trying to deflect the question, or if he was just being weird in general. I figured I might be overthinking it and maybe my friend was just messing with me (or just really out of it today), but someone else pulled me aside and asked if everything was okay with my friend so I doubt it's all in my head. My first two thoughts were either suicide/depression or drugs; he was coherent, walking fine, and able to order his food and everything so I doubt he was on something. It was just weird that it felt like he couldn't finish a full conversation and wasn't acting like himself at all. He's never talked about suicide or anything like that so it's not like I've been worried about him long-term, it's something that I just noticed today. I just wanted to see if anyone has input on whether or not this could be a sign of depression/suicidal thoughts.",0

We had to hold off on the body surgery because of costs, but now finally had enough and went and got several consults. All have said the same thing. The puberty blockers have left her with a micro penis. She has to get part of her vagina made with her colon. Well one of her friends had that surgery, and even years later it smells fairly colon like. Obviously my daughter is now distraught. She is in counseling, but is becoming worse and worse in her mental state and I am frantic. On top of this, she has never had any sexual function. NO urges, no erections, even when she tried masturbation to see if she could stimulate herself...nothing. The doctors say this may not change even after the surgery. Her dating life is dismal as well. We knew it would be hard. But its impossible. The one man who was with her for a while, soon just became frustrated by her lack of sexual anything and broke it off.

666,"[Support] Parent of a teen daughter here, with real worries - one of her friends is sending out text messages about cutting and self-harm. Not prepared for this... [TW: self-harm, suicide]Hope this is a proper subreddit for this. 13 year old girls have two x chromosomes, right? Seriously, I lurk a LOT because quite frankly I find it really insightful. I should probably point out also that I am the Dad, not the Mom. Anyway, I'm really hoping the hive mind can help with some insight into the social dynamics of 13-14 year-old girls. I don't know what the best approach is. Here is what I do know: My daughter is 13, and is friends with a group of 5-6 eighth-grade girls I can safely call ""misfits."" I mean that in a loving-ish way - they are a strange amalgam of nerds, goofs, outcasts, and slackers, not the cute-perky-petite-popular type(s). They text CONSTANTLY. Hundreds of times a day. My daughter does not participate in this anywhere near as much - she is generally busy - athletics, band, and a 94-95 average across all her courses - so she kind of phases in and out periodically of their extended conversations. One other girl in her peer group is an Honors student, the rest are not (a couple only made it to 8th grade from 7th thanks to social promotion, IIBH). Two of the other girls in the group have ""come out""; recently, my daughter ""semi"" came out as well, as in ""I think I might be bi."" She has feelings-ish for one of the girls in the peer group (the Honors student, I was relieved to hear, and if that makes me a bad parent, so be it). That girl is one of the two who came out. The other girl who came out -- let's call her ""Jasmine"" -- appears to have feelings for my daughter. This girl, Jasmine, has been increasingly clingy-ish (if it is possible to be clingy by text) of late. Needy might be a better word. Two days ago, she sent a message saying that she was going to cut herself (or was thinking about it, but ""chickened out,"" her words) and wrote that she need to talk to my daughter RIGHT NOW. But she accidentally texted it to the whole group. And shit just exploded. Now all the parents know, the girls are all traumatized, and my wife and I don't know what the hell to do other than show our daughter as much support as possible and urge her to talk to us ANYtime she needs to. But since then, ""Jasmine"" has been texting about it incessantly. ""Would you guys even miss me?"" That kind of thing. One of my daughter's friends has been having panic attacks as a result. And ""Jasmine"" has been texting my daughter privately more and more, making it feel to her like the burden is on her to ""save"" Jasmine, etc... And the fact that she believes that Jasmine has feelings for her is making her feel even more obligated to ""save"" her, keep her secrets, etc... At the same time, our daughter did NOT tell us -- we found about it from a text by one of the girls' parents. I think she thinks that we'll think she's doing something bad. We have tried to convince her that we're not upset with her, or mad at anything she has done, but we don't know to both RESPECT and PROTECT her at the same time without demonizing Jasmine in the process and/or making our daughter feel like she has failed as a friend (or even as a daughter) somehow. Help?? ------------ **UPDATE** About 20-30 minutes ago (around 11 pm local time), ""Jasmine"" sent the following flurry of texts: ""Don't even care anymore. I could die right now for all I care."" / ""Then this stupid pointless existence would end and people would be better off."" To which one of her fucknugget friends (I know I lovingly called them ""misfits"" earlier, but this one girl really rubs me the wrong way - she's kind of the mama bear of the troupe) texted ""ok."" Jasmine texted in response: ""Goodbye."" I grabbed the phone and called Jasmine's dad **straight away**, had him check on her ASAP and grab her cell phone and read her messages. I left it in his hands, but after I post this I'm going to email my daughter's guidance counselor at school too. Fuck, I hope he is not part of the problem.",0
667,"Daughters best friend is suicidal and on mission- he reached out..advice please!UPDATE: He is coming home immediately.

Thank you to everyone who was ready to immediately jump in and help. Thank you for all the advice and resources. It was such a comfort today knowing that we could help. TLDR: Daughters friend is suicidal, needs to come home and leave mission, not sure how to help, worried about what awaits him..is there anything we can do in this situation..I have known this kid 10 years and love him like one of my own. **He emailed** last week and said he was suicidal. We were all horrified and pleaded with him to find a way to call day or night. To our amazement he has been in contact with our daughter regularly (I didn't think the mission would let him text or email). **He said** he thinks he shouldn't be on a mission and doesn't know why he is. My daughter essentially said ""come home and it will be okay"" I am worried it won't be okay because I know his family well. His dad is currently bishop and neither of his parents ""believe in depression"" and think it is sin or negativity (common for Mormons). He was totally ignored when he said he was deeply depressed in high school, in fact they mocked it and openly criticized him. Of course he can stay with us, but that won't change what awaits him. **I am also worried** they won't let him come home but will send him back to BYU where he was depressed. We live in a small rural area where members are very nosy. He would have zero privacy and a hoard of people ""persuading"" him the minute he got off the plane. I am not sure such a fragile kid will be able to withstand the alienation and helpful brainwashing coming his way. **I need advice**..we aren't sure what to do and we want him to be safe and taken care of. We are worried the mission president will talk him out of it, or his parents will or they will send him over the edge mentally before we can get to him and help him. We are ready to help in any way we can..but what should we be doing?",0

I feel like part of this is my fault and now its too late.I am not sure if this is the right place for this. &#x200B; My daughter died from cancer, a very fast acting cancer which she choose to not get treatment for. Over the span of 4 months, she deteriorated and then died. During this time, my husband turned into a severe alcoholic and drug abuser. I got depressed, as did my son. Watching my daughter, the sweetest child in the world, pass away like that was horrific. &#x200B; My husbands alcoholism (and drug abuse, he was doing pills heavily as well, although tried to keep it secret) spiraled out of control to the point where he was drinking a 20 dollar bottle of vodka every day, and then some more after. He would often go out and not come home for the entire night. My son kept on trying to get him to stop, and I sort of tried... but I was so depressed that I just didnt have the heart to put in much emotional effort into him. I isolated myself completely, and was like a zombie. My husband died in our basement bathroom, covered in his own vomit. He died from a mix of huge amounts of alcohol and huge amounts of xanax and tramadol mixed together. I knew he was doing pills, but I never knew the real extent of it until we found his stash of pills after he died. His death came about 3-4 months after my daughters death. &#x200B; After my husband died, I sort of woke up from my daze, but not for long before I fell back into it. My son also fell into a horrible, deep depression. It wasn't only his dad and sister dying. His grades fell apart, he got rejected from almost every college except for community colleges. He gained well over 100 pounds in the year after his dad died. Both of us were just a mess. I didn't leave bed most days, he stayed in his room... doing whatever he would do. Video games I imagined. I didn't ignore the signs completely the way I did with my husband. I tried to reach out to him, get him into therapy, for a while. But my own depression was so bad that I was giving up on everything. I think at a certain point we just left each other alone. &#x200B; In the 2 months before, we barely spoke at all. It wasn't hard, our house is big, our rooms are far apart. And then he tried to kill himself, by throwing himself off of a bridge nearby. He survived. He got a broken foot and his toe is all mangled, but he survived. I saw where he threw himself off, it was a long distance. I don't even know how he managed to only break his foot. &#x200B; I feel such a wave of guilt flow over me since the incident. Both for him and for my husband too. I didn't pay enough attention, I didn't give them what they needed, I was selfish honestly. I am their mother and wife and I just isolated myself instead of being with them and helping them and getting them through this. I constantly think that if I was more attentive, more demanding for my husband to get sober, then this wouldn't have happened. None of it. Losing my daughter was horrible, but we couldn't control that. But this? This is our decisions. And my presence influences their decisions arguably more than anything. &#x200B; I just don't know what to do. I want to help my son but don't know how, and I feel he is ignoring my attempts to help him, because I have ignored him for so long. I can't tell if he is still suicidal. I can't tell if the second his foot heals he is going to try again. I am 'awake' in that I am aware of my being and place instead of being a depressed zombie like I have been for the past 2 years... but I am feeling hopeless again that I cant help.",1

685,"Saying good-bye I hate posting like this, in blind angst cry for help but yet too stubborn to accept it. My anxiety makes me want to kill myself. Hell, I dont deserve to live. ""The reasons have disappeared but the feeling still remains."" Thats my life in a fucking nutshell. All I know is that Im in pain and I want it all to stop. I even push my best friend away. Worthless imbecill! I dont deserve him anyway. I was on my way to ask him for help, but then I realized I just want to say good-bye. Say Im sorry and leave.",1
686,"suicidal again There are many things I'm just plain tired of. The constant yelling and fighting between my 12 yr old and my wife is what makes me want to do it. The more I have to listen to it the more I get closer to actually finishing what I want to do. I figure they can have the life insurance and they can't fight all they friggin want to and I won't have to hear it anymore. There are many things I've come to terms with. Suicide is the ultimate sin that you can't ask forgiveness for. Eternal hell. I'm ok with that. It doesn't bother me so much like it has in the past. Last time the urge got so bad I actually did get help. They wanted me to check in to some inpatient facility but I told them I wasn't about to be strapped to some bed all day long. So they put me on an anti-psychotic. Well a lot of good that does. My body metabolizes medications so fast and I have to take it at night because it makes me sleepy that I don't think there's any of it in my system by morning. Things that will knock most people on their butt I have to take a large amount of to work. But that's not the way I want to go. There is a risk of rescue that I think isn't worthwhile. I'm not ""reaching out for help"" because I believe one of these nights the yelling and fighting will push me too far and the overwhelming urge to remove myself will be more than I can stand. It's a daily thing and in all honesty I can't believe it hasn't happened yet. One time the therapist asked why I don't just leave and move out. I don't know how many of you work crappy government jobs and make next to nothing but seriously...where would I go. Move out only to be alone? I can do that now by removing myself. For now the urge has subsided because the yelling and the fighting have stopped. But it will be back tomorrow. It always is. I wish I could say I was able to fight it but it really does get stronger every day. I can picture it and it just doesn't bother me. And really...maybe it will be the ultimate revenge. I've been tortured for so long by this nonsense maybe it's time to let someone else be tortured for once. Because frankly I'm too old and tired to put up with this nonsense every single day. The funny part is I even asked my wife to go to the therapist to learn techniques for dealing with our oldest who has ADHD and she just can't seem to be bothered. I guess she's happy with all the carrying on. But I'm certainly not.",1
687,"Please Save Me Guys, I really don't know how to start this, but I've been having suicidal thoughts for some time now. The truth is, I really don't want to die, but I don't want to live either. I'm 22. I've been back at home with my dad and step-mother for almost a year now, and I can't handle it. I've always struggled with depression, but I can't handle this environment. I have a job, but I don't make enough money to support myself. I lived alone for four years, I went through poverty and many nights I didn't know where my next meal would come from. I was depressed throughout that, but I didn't want to die. And now I'm back at home with my alcoholic father and control freak hateful step-mother, and I just want to take my shotgun, stick it in my mouth, and pull the trigger in front of them. I want my step-mother to know that her hatefulness killed me. I want her to feel the pain that she's caused me. When I first moved back here, I had some fight left in me. When she acted out and tried to stress me out, I bit back. Now I just put my tail between my legs and take her yelling. Lately, it's ramped up my heartrate and I just can't think. She can't read my body language, and she mistakes my fear for anger, and she yells at me even more. I just can't fight back. She is a control freak and she's addicted to stress. I can't take that. I'm not angry, I just can't handle it. I just want to die at that moment. I just want to put a shotgun in my mouth and blow my brains out. This happened again last night, and I tried to explain that I can't take her talking to me that way, and she lashed out at me even more. She thinks she can do no wrong. I just wanted to die. One day later, I still want to die. I've thought of nothing else but killing myself all day. I just hate the fact that she has this anger. For the past year, my gut has been twisted because I never know what kind of mood she's going to be in, and I'd rather die than be around that. When I'm alone, away from here, I don't feel that. I just want to be alone. I want to live by myself, and no one can dictate my mood but me. I can't fucking take how she acts, and I just want to fucking die. Every time I talk to her about this, she makes me feel lower than dirt. She talks to me like a child, and I fucking hate that. I grew up in an abusive home, and I can't take her anger. How can I deal with this? How can I get through this without killing myself? I don't want to die, but I don't want to live with her, and I don't have a way out. I'm too depressed to look for a different job, and I just want a way out. I just try to get through each mood she's in, and I'm running out of steam. I just can't fucking take the way she acts. I'm more afraid of her than anyone else on this planet. I want to stand my ground like I used to, but I don't have it in me. My heart starts beating really fast and I feel like I'm about to have a heart attack, and she thinks I'm mad. I can't fucking take this. Please, guys. Please tell me a way out.",1
688,suicidal and depressed again yah lately this the way i have been feeling has been getting more worse i really need to talk to my doctor and counselor i cant wait til friday i need to take care of this right now but i cant im just emotionally tired and stressed out :?,1
689,"Suicide because Hair Loss I have been suicidal for almost 5 years now and it is due to hair loss. Having a full head of hair is absolutely integral to my ability to feel handsome and comfortable in my own skin, and to my enjoyment of life. I noticed my hair loss very late so no amount of preventative medication or any other type of current treatment can really help me out at this point. Not to mention, I was on anti-depressants for a number of years, which I believe triggered the premature onset of my hair loss, a fact that I didn't even know until it was too late. I have also experienced terrible side effects from finasteride, which is the most common medication to prevent hair loss today. And I am not about to wear a wig. Life is just not worth living anymore and I always wish I would just fall asleep and never wake up. I cry out to God to relieve my pain and He does absolutely nothing. I don't know where else to turn or what else to do. Life is just hopeless.",1
690,"Really, really down This pain is never going to leave me and it has crippled my life completely and I am just tired of it. It's just one misery after the next and everyone that I like ends up not liking me once they get to know me. It's just the annoying people that I hate tend to like me and I suppose I must be one of them to the people I like. This is maybe the way for many people. There is no answer. Life just does not work or only works for some but not others. I am self-centred, egotistical and unkind and I hate my life and myself. I hate how boring I am. I hate how few friends I have. I hate how I feel about myself. I hate having to be hated. And I hate God for creating this shitty existence that is a journey from one misery to the next with carrots to lead you along the way. As Shakespeare put, ""As flies to wanton boys are we to the Gods, they kill (torture) us for their sport.""",1

692,"Wishing I Were Dead Already I was watching that ad for the St. Jude Hospitial and wsas thinking to myself how much I envied those people with cancer because at least they don't have to stay in this fucked up place for much longer and get bitched at at four in the fucking morning or blamed for every fucking thing that goes on, or get things they did years ago rubbed in their faces so theyed feel more guilty then they already do.",1
693,"Help. Help me please. I feel like such a hypocrite right now but I can't take it anymore. I've been trying so hard to be strong. But I can't. I can't and I have no one to talk to. I can't go to my family. My mom will panic and make herself sick, it'll just get worse. I can't go to my friends. Most of them don't know or don't understand my past. And I can't get ahold of the ones who do understand. I can't go to my ex, she's shut me out completely. And she's the cause of all this anyway. I hurt so bad right now. I'm sitting here at work, I didn't want to come in, but I had to. And I just can't stop crying. I'm hiding in the back office. And I just can't stop. I want to die. I don't want to hurt like this anymore. I can't stop crying.",1
694,Really depressed. Well I am really depressed right now... I feel like dying.... I just want to world to end... I really really feel down... the only reason I dont kill myself is my girlfriend... I dont even know why i am so down.... :( I am really really feeling bad...,1
695,"Pretty pointless My life is going down the drain. I have absolutely nothing to look forward to so why should i even try? Why even leave my bed and why even continue? All i will ever achieve is a below average life with a below average wife(MAYBE) with a job i will hate. Its all pointless and I keep thinking about suicide more and more. I have even started crying before i go to sleep. A little about me is that I use humor to cover up my depression so no one has any clue how bad this has gotten or that i have ever been depressed. I have no way to share anything because of my ego that i can't get over. If were to commit suicide i would much rather go as a surprise than a ""oh, well that was expected."" I'm suppose to be the happy-go-lucky guy that doesn't worry about anything and takes everything as a joke. Theres just nothing that can make me happy ever. I'm thinking of even not going to college. If things got to bad i could just kill myself and everything would be fixed.",1
