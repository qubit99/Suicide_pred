0,"I think I found a place to live! It is really nice and very cute! And its in the locality that I want to live in. Its close to work, pubs, clubs, restaurants, and shops! And its cheap! Around $330/month for a 1300 sq. ft. two bedroom apt. The interior is so beautiful. Think of Portland style of 20s architecture with a hint of British influence. I am very excited to have seen it. I was told that I should negotiate the rent even lower...like around Rs. 12,000, which comes out to $266/month. So, okay I will try...doesn't hurt to ask right? That's how I got here!!!!   Yes, India is very cheap but like the States â there are certain things that are cheap or expensive. Today, I was looking at liquor like vodka, more specifically Vanilla Stoli (forgot the name brand) but it would normally cost $20 in the states, here it costs $6. Cable television here is around $2-$4/month. I bought lunch at the Intel cafeteria on Monday for $0.90 (and yes it was a meal!). A pair of nice jeans here cost $10âŚclothes are also cheap and the quality is amazing!!!   I still can't get over the MNC's (multi-national companies) buildings here...its very western architecture mixed right in with shanty towns or old, dilapidated looking buildings. I just saw Dell yesterday and today I saw HP. VERY WEIRD. Its all here in India! There are also tons of people hereâŚ.close to 7 million.   I have impressed quite a few Indians here with my knowledge of Bangalore - research helped. Impressed that I know the street names and even some landmarks - and also a few of the major stores here. After 6 days just being here, I am starting to feel comfortable and at home. That just amazes me...and I am even starting to do the Indian head nod from left to right. Next thing I'll be picking up some salwar kameezes to wear.",26,female

I didn't have any of it yesterday, and so far none today.  :)  What a nice day.  And here I am, chained to my desk with all of this paperwork...ugh.  That's OK - I feel so good, I will just rip through all of this paperwork this morning and maybe I can get out of here a bit early this afternoon.  That's a plan.  We'll see.  I think I may try to have a nooner with my hubby too - that is one of the perks about working with him!  And to all of my family, that really didn't want to hear about that - Sorry!  But isn't it good to know that your daughter, sister, neice, cousin does have a really EXCELLENT sex life?  That is important! haha!  :) wink, wink!  I know, I'm incorrigible - but you know me, I've always been that way!  That's how I landed me that husband in the first place!  Anyway - hope everyone else is having as good a day as I am!

3,"ASSET RESPOSITORY    What is an asset repository?  You mean you don’t know?  Well, here’s the beef.  An asset repository is similar to a bank depository—it stores valuables, although in the case of asset repository, it stores valuable information.  These repositories are high class, elaborate, and require the same thing that banks do—lots and lots of money.  Read more about asset repositories in the following extended definition.     “An asset is only an asset when you can find it,  or you know that you have it in the first place”   Teri Ross, Techexchange.com    An asset repository is rather a combination two elements: digital asset management and asset repository.  Whereas the digital asset management (DAM) is a tool to organize digital media assets for storage and retrieval, an asset repository is where and how the data is stored, typically on “a high-end UNIX server, [with] large online storage space and high-speed networks” (Ross).  The DAM application organizes and retrieves the digital media and the asset repository stores it.    Digital Asset Management   Digital Asset Management (DAM) is a means to keep, find and secure files of text, images or sound.  DAM also tracks ownership and rights of the content and implements task management.  Well organized and accessible content results in the ability to quickly find images and data, which systemizes workflow, saving time and money (Brown).   In the computer world . . . there are systems that will pick up after us and remember where we put things. These systems will retrieve items, let us pass them around, and then clean the place up when we're through. I refer, of course, to the software and hardware systems that are called, variously, digital media management, media asset management or digital asset management (DAM) (Smith).  Digital asset management is the software and hardware needed for content management.  The location in which content is stored is the asset repository.   Asset (or Content) Repository  Actual “asset repositories” are generally found in large, high-end asset management systems ($100,000 and up).  Asset repositories are a “secure collection of the source files themselves”.  The image at the webpage below shows the asset repository as a sort of holding tank for content.   urlLink http://www.assetnow.com/index.cfm/4,437,html   A large asset repository performs like a database.  It contains: security, replication, backup safeguards, disaster recovery, referential integrity, centralized data management and a hierarchical storage structure. “Such a system lends itself to workflows that require access security, including management of rights or permissions and access for suppliers or customers. These systems require a high-performance server, a fast network and significant online storage capacity” (Brown).  Asset repositories are sophisticated and expensive systems that contain the actual content within a secure database.  This usually means higher performance software like , “high-end UNIX servers, formidable online storage, and very high-speed networks”.  This allows for “security levels, replication, referential integrity, and centralized data management. Also included is the comfort of full hierarchical storage management and disaster recovery” (Ross).     Solutions based on the asset repository model are ideal when systematizing studios with industrial workflow, managing rights and permissions (such as the intellectual property of either your company or a third party), and structuring global access by employees, contractors, suppliers, partners, and customers (Smith).   Media Catalog vs. Asset Repository  Instead of an asset repository, smaller companies often use media catalogs “that store proxies alone, indexed to the source files"" (Brown).  Media catalogs have proxies (like thumbnails) which are stored in a database indexed by keywords.  The actual source files are under the control of the operating system and are not touched.  Media catalogs are low cost, easy to install and administer and have “scalability across multiple divisions of an enterprise” (Ross).  Media catalogs don’t manage the actual content, so anyone with system access to view, change, move or delete content elements (Ross).     Media Catalog  Entry level solution Desktop or within a workgroup Organizes small collections of images, graphics and text Provides multiple access Cost – under $50,000   Asset Repository  Mid-range solution Client/server technology Wide area networks Manages all assets used in a production job (layouts, images, fonts) Files stored on server, access via DAM system only Check-in/check-out to control versions Stores assets with links for simple retrieval Cost – under $100,00   Upper-End Solutions 3-tier client/server architecture Designed to “drive enterprise on the Internet” Cost – over $100,00 (Smith)",42,female

5,"Auto Response from Garaputo316: I am outside standing in the rain, legs spread wide with my arms stretched towards the sky. My hands are tightly gripping a mighty sword as I scream ""I have the powwwweeeerrrr!!!!"" You see, I am attempting to get struck by lightning so that it will seem as if I am the great He-Man. Even if it only lasts for a split second, it will be crazy as hell.  That's what my away message said for a little while today. You guys thought I was joking, I was serious. Except I had a pole and not a sword... but who the heck has a sword nowadays **coughJustincough**. I'm on some He-Man kick after watching  Masters of the Universe . The movie wasn't cool or anything, but when Dolph Lundgren yelled ""I have the power!"" I remembered the part from the old show where he would lift his sword in the air and lightning would strike it. Then I remembered when Charlie Wagner imitated it with a metal baseball bat and I laughed for a half hour straight. It was pretty crazy when I did it, but I had no luck with the lightning strike, sadly.  After that little endeavor I walked up to 7-11 to buy some Sour Bright Crawlers. I ended up staying there for a while reading an  Import Tuner  magazine. When I left the guy made fun of me for staying in there too long. I just laughed. It could've been worse; I could've stayed in there much longer, but I decided to leave before I seemed like a kook. Apparently I already looked like one. It's ok though, next time I will stay in there  all  day reading  all  the magazines and eating  all  the food -- and I won't pay for it. Wuahaha. Yep, I'm wiggin.  My dad said that we're going to work at 3 o clock this morning and I was like ""AM?"" and he's like ""yeah."" The funny thing is he's not playing around. That's how we do it around here yo.

7,"My prediction.   An email I sent out 2 minutes ago.  I predict that Rick Fox and Bryan Russel will drop a combined 40 on the Pistons tonight, Shaq will make 14 straight free-throws, Payton will lead the team in rebounds, and Kobe will have 4 points, 20 assists, and no turnover.  Karl will lose his knee brace and his right shoe on a lay-up attempt, which will hit Rasheed in the eye and sideline him for the entire game.  Hamilton's mask will fog up and his blurred vision will cause him to run into a pick and breaking his nose in the 3rd quarter.    Kid Rock will spill his beer and Chauncey will trip on it, breaking his tailbone.  Luke Walton will dunk on Ben Wallace, and as a result both Walton senior and Phil Jackson will have to be escorted out by security for excessive celebration and excessive reference to John Wooden, respectively.  And in the end, they will probably still lose to the Pistons.  Which is just as well, I would never share a championship with all these fair weather band wagon fans in LA anyway.  Fuck them.  Tell them that Yankees still have a shot and their hats are on sale.  After watching all the Lakers' pre, regular, and post season games, I knew from the beginning that this was going to be a tough series, despite all these basketball gurus annointing Lakers in 5.  Somehow, recognizing all the flaw in my team makes me feel like the one true Lakers' fan in the world.  cho",25,male

9,"Whats new in the land of the Suddenly single? Well, how about a review of the best places to goggle the other supposedly singles, suddenly singles and permanently singles, and see if we can tell the difference between them. Our favorite places are in the La Jolla/Del Mar area, but there are lots more yet to discover, say Downtown San Diego, and Mission Valley.   Cafe Japengos - known for its BUSTling Thursday nights, this crowd is a little more relaxed these days. Here you will see mostly blonde and gray hair - blonde women and gray-haired men chasing them! You can get the best sushi in san diego here as well as the best apple martini. All this after working out at the club/spa sporting club one across the circle.   Epazotes/Cafe Pacifica - Del mar is not only famous for its horses, but its long-legged FILLIES!!! Here you get a much mellower scene, where you can start at Epazotes, stroll across to Cafe Pacifica, then wine-down at the wine bar at Il Forniao. This is my personal favorite, but watch out - here is where you are most likely to be taken in by a beautiful sunset and romanced into thinking a permanently single is just a regular old single (You see there are differences). Here you will be lulled by the sound of the fountian tinkling as you sip a special port or smoke a special cigar. Dont fall asleep, or like a midsummers night dream, you will wake up to find yourself with bruises and not know where they came from!   what else? There is Dobsons Downtown, where I hear the lawyers lurk, and then Gordon Beirsh, the younger business/networking crowd.   This suddenly single has decided that she will not be going to these places anymore, due to an unfortunate incident involving too much, too soon, and not enough from the wrong person! You figure that one out and you win the ""suddenly single sweepstakes"". :)  When suddenly single, it is generally a good idea to call all the people that you forgot about while not single, and re-connect, apologising and supplicating yourself until it becomes embarrassing for said friends. They will forgive you, but you must try harder next time you are not single to maintain contact or they may forget about you.  Places to take those that you are kissing up to: Art - The Vatican is coming out of the closet - er - showing itself - er - displaying its treasures (oh! I give UP) at the San Diego Museum of art, in a rare never before seen in public appearance. music - the yeah yeah yeahs are playing at Soma, soon. Very high cool factor. duh. For the rest of you yahoos, Friday is the ""your 5"" concert with Jessica simpson and a bunch of un-altered MUSICIANS. Sports - The rock and roll marathon is coming up - running, drinking and bands - a great event to spend all our suddenly single time preparing for!   When suddenly single, I found that the best therapy was window-shopping for things that any of your exes would not have approved of - open-toed shoes, low-rise jeans, new peircings- this time in your tongue.   Keep to your friends, friends, and you'll never go wrong.",36,female

The first part (before the ""/"") is the english pronunciation, and the second (after the ""/"") is the real spelling (for words in different languages).   urlLink This  is a good site for finding some good words.   szhamma/llama - I'm not sure what it means, if anything, but evidently in argentinean ""ll"" is pronounced like a soft J.  In german, it would be spelled ""schamma.""  Szhamma is usually used as an exclamation, such as ""Szhamma!"" although it can also be used as a noun, i.e. ""Don't be a szhamma.""  pasae/passer - Also a french word, I have no clue what this one means either, but I do know it's an infinitive form verb.  Since I know it's a verb, I decided to use it as a verb, although, like szhamma, it means next to nothing.  By the way, in german, it'd be ""paßee.""  (dee) gesheershpoolmachina/(die) Geschirrspülmaschine - German for dishwasher.  Just altogether a cool word.  Just a side note, the umlauted ""ü"" is pronounced more like ""eww"" than ""oo"" but it's a subtle difference.  fishsticks - A word Erik Johnson used to say all the time, it's similar to ""Shoot!"" and can't be used for good things.  peaches  peachy - Peaches I use similarly to fishsticks, except with good things.  Peachy is a synonym to super or great.  mofo - I'm sure many of you know what this word is short for, and that it generally means a good friend, similar to ""homey"" although to me sometimes it means what it really is short for.  Kustom Fooder - A phrase we used a lot in ABS today, one of the wisefools came up with it.  I'm sure you can guess it means ""Custom Footer""  wisefool - synonymous to sophmore, which does in fact mean wise fool in some language.  I use it as a noun for sophs as well as an insult to anyone who's not one.  hoser - an idiot.    Lunch was quite interesting today.  Angie and her ""Jo-Jo Po-Ta-Toes"" and that she ""wants to beat Mr. Thompson with a polish sausage.""

17,"I'm awake, just can't sleep a wink.  I'm pregnant AGAIN.  Yes, that was a scream.  It's kind of cool in a way, and kind of crazy-making in a way.  How could my life get any more out of control?   I was already sliding toward a breakdown, and then this happens, out of the blue, without my knowledge or approbation.  Do some bodies just want to get pregnant?  Must be.

Midwives call in prescription for phenegren to Seattle while I'm on vacation (vomiting and lying on the couch in Seattle instead of Utah. ) 3)  I want to die now. 4)  Stop taking phenegren pills because I can't keep them down.  Try phenegren suppositories.  5)Phenegren suppositories give diarrhea.  Stop taking. 6)  Can't eat or keep down any food for 24.  Go to ER for IV hydration and nausea drugs.  AAAAAHHHH. 7)  ER doc gives prescription for zofran.  Ten pills cost 100 bucks--that's my COPAY.  AAAAAHHH.  The day after the IV and the zofran is heaven. 8)  But the nausea comes back.  But not all the way, as long as I take the zofran religiously every eight hours. 9)  Two pills left.  My insurance hasn't approved more zofran.  It's early sunday morning. I need three pills to get to Monday.  I'm scared.  And who will pay for more pills, Christian asks. 10)  We can sell our house and move into a tent to pay for more pills.  I don't care.  I'll kill myself.  I'm a wimp.  I can't take it anymore.  I feel worn to a nub, and less strong and resiliant than ever before in my life.  Shouldn't I be all strong and tough after what I've been thru? 11) The zofran makes you constipated and hemerrhoidal.  Buy stool softener and witch hazel wipes.  Dignity is gone. 12)  They can send a man to the moon,  or send a man's penis skyrocketing anyway, but what about helping a girl out with her pregnancy.  Surely more women experience pregnancy than men experience erectile dysfunction.  And surely the relative magnitude of the two problems is not lost on anybody?  13) Do people know what it's like to feel like you have the flu for three, four, five, six, seven, eight or even nine months?

He shook his tiny head, and struggled to open his eyes. We gazed into one another. Time stopped. Nothing but the flow of love between us existed. A moment of grace. A moment that seemed so natural, so spontaneous, and in some ways, so familiar. I had been to that place before. But I couldn't remember when, or where.  As the years went by, the grace flowed. As love was given, it was now returned; not because I was such a perfect father, or the most handsome, or the smartest; but because I was Dad.   This is the root of my understanding of our relationship with God. God is madly, head-over-heals in love with us, and woos us, and all of creation, into being, because we are. I have a hard time holding on to this foundational relationship. In day to day life, it doesn't fit very well. Head over there and read his discussion... I promise, it will make you re-evaluate grace.    Grace   She carries a pearl In perfect condition What once was hers What once was friction What left a mark No longer stains  Because grace makes beauty Out of ugly things  Grace finds beauty In everything  Grace finds goodness In everything   -U2",24,male

25,"Advertising can be divided into two broad categories—consumer advertising and trade advertising. Consumer advertising is directed at the public. Trade advertising is directed at wholesalers or distributors who resell to the public. This article focuses on consumer advertising, the form of advertising that is familiar to most people.  Consumer advertising can be further divided into national advertising and local advertising. National advertising is aimed at consumers throughout the entire country. National advertising usually attempts to create awareness among the public of a product or service, or it tries to build loyalty to a product or service. Local advertising is aimed at informing people in a particular area where they can purchase a product or service. Advertising to the public may also take the form of institutional advertising, image advertising, informational advertising, or cooperative advertising.  Institutional advertising seeks to create a favorable impression of a business or institution without trying to sell a specific product. This type of advertising is designed solely to build prestige and public respect. For nonprofit institutions, such advertising helps support the institution’s activities—for example, by encouraging blood donations or cash contributions for the work of an organization like the Red Cross. A for-profit business has other reasons for improving its reputation rather than trying to sell a particular product. In some cases a large company may sell a diversity of products. As a result, there is more value and greater efficiency in building a brand image for the company itself. If consumers learn to have a high regard for the company, then they are more likely to have a favorable opinion of all of the company’s diverse products.  Many advertisers prefer a strategy known as image advertising. These advertisers seek to give a product a personality that is unique, appealing, and appropriate so that the consumer will want to choose it over similar products that might fulfill the same need. The personality is created partly by the product's design and packaging but, more importantly, by the words and pictures the advertisements associate with the product. This personality is known as a brand image. Advertisers believe brand image often leads consumers to select one brand over another or instead of a less expensive generic product. Brand image is especially important for commodities such as detergents, jeans, hamburgers, and soft drinks, because within these product categories there are few, if any, major differences.   Informational advertising seeks to promote an idea or influence behavior. Sometimes known as public service advertising, it may try to discourage young people from using illicit drugs or tobacco, or it may encourage people to adopt safer, healthier lifestyles.  Cooperative advertising is an arrangement between manufacturers and retailers in which manufacturers offer credits to their retail customers for advertising. The credits, or advertising allowances, are based on the amount of product the retailer purchases. For example, if the retailer purchases $100,000 worth of a product from a manufacturer, the manufacturer’s cooperative advertising program may allot a 1 percent credit, or $1,000, toward the cost of purchasing an ad that will feature the product. In addition, some manufacturers will match the amount that the retailer spends, sharing the cost of the ad. In the United States antitrust laws enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ensure that these ad allowances are offered on equal and proportionate terms so that large retailers are not unduly favored over small retailers. Cooperative advertising is a form of local advertising because it directs consumers to local retail outlets.   urlLink",24,male

31,"So, I read Lacy's walk down memory lane. I love how she remembers details. There's an interesting story every time she recollects something. It's not always what one might call ""accurate"", but it sure is interesting.   urlLink As she mentioned , we generally discuss how we got to where we are, but like, way back at the beginning. After ""first, there was nothing"", but before ""...and they all lived happily ever after"". This story is that story, between then and now. (Now now? Or then now? When was then now? We just missed it.) (All poorly picked out paraphrases are courtesy of Spaceballs: The Search for an Accurate Memory.)  Lacy and I are technically high school sweethearts, which is great, cause it illicits that ""awwww"" from people hearing this for the first time. I like that. I love that I can tell our child(ren) that. Back in that day, I was young, and poor. I did have lots of energy, but all too often (as she was sure to mention) it was used on things other than spending time with her. I regret that somewhat, cause that's what we fought about, and I really really hate fighting with her. She'll never believe that, but I do. So, being young, and poor, I wasn't the best boyfriend. Sorry, sweetheart.  We were supposed to get married outside three years ago, but it rained. A lot. Not as planned. Mother Nature owes me. Big. She started the repayment by giving us Xander. But she's not done. I'm watching you, Mother Nature. Even though it rained, and we were soaked, and I was really tired, and we didn't have the wedding we had planned, the very most important thing that was supposed to happen that day happened. We got married. Yeah, the details weren't perfect, but she was. I've never seen her more beautiful.  She doesn't remember the day the way I do, and that's okay. We got to here from there, through better and worse, sickness and health, cats and dogs, houses and hot tubs, doctors for ankles and doctors for babies, cable and satellite, new cars and used cars, bathroom remodeling and fence rebuilding.  Eventually, I got better, but that was awhile in coming. Not that I'm perfect now. Which sucks to admit. But I love her, and as cliche as it is to say, now more than ever. She's put up with an incredible amount of ill-advised to horrendously stupid things from me. And she doesn't even bring these things up every day! Just when I've done something else stupid. I think I'm a stupidity-debt indentured servant. But you know what, I wouldn't change it for anything. I can never undo that stuff, but I can try to be as good a husband to her as I can.  So many things have happened since we've gotten married, not to mention all the stuff before that. I can't imagine my life without her, and I don't even want to consider it.

47,"What causes sinusitis?  Most cold viruses only result in a blocked nose. However, if the mucous membrane lining the nasal passages and sinuses swells up, this can block mucus drainage. Mucus builds up causing the pressure and pain of sinusitis. Bacteria or fungi are more likely to grow in sinuses that can’t drain properly, and bacterial infection often causes more inflammation and pain.   Chronic sinusitis is caused by anything that irritates the lining of the nose over long periods and causes the mucous membrane to swell. Examples include:   *grass and tree pollen, *cold air, *alcohol, *perfumes, *damp weather, *allergy to house dust mite, mould,and fungi, *chronic drug use (""snorting"").    People who have allergy-based asthma often have sinusitis as well. Indeed, any problem with the nose that blocks the drainage holes can produce sinusitis. This can include polyps (small nodules of mucous membrane), and injury that causes the bridge to lean to one side (deviated nasal septum).  Tooth and gum infections can spread to the sinuses. Rarer causes of sinusitis include conditions that weaken the immune system such as HIV and cystic fibrosis. Swimming, air pollution and smoking can aggravate sinusitis.",37,female

49,"in this journey of life, i have always had background noise. whether it be the tv, mildlessly droning on behind conversations, dinners and hours spent in front of another monitor, or music, a more active participant in everyday activities, causing me to burst into song or remember a clear event of times past. tv has always allowed concentration away from it, while music screams for attention. in both cases, since i can remember they have been a complete part of my life. in play, sleep, eat, study and creation they have constantly been with me. until recently i started going to sleep with no sounds to accompany me.    once allowed, every image that the outside noise was drowning out filled my closed eyes ceaselessly. every injury, every win - everything i have experienced in my life began crashing in front of my eyes, settling me into a cringing display of want of escape. all of this before i slept. every moment from that day and days passed flashed at horrific speeds while needing relaxation.   i started to avoid sleep until i would literary be falling over in my chair. i pushed myself into some form of exhaustion every day in hopes to side-step the silence. the pictures still flashed before my eyes, but i didn't have the energy to react or attempt to control them. so instead, i would count. yes, the pictures flashed and distracted me, but i decided if i could focus on one simple task, i could sleep. i began counting backwards from 100, every night. i would start over if the images distracted me - teaching myself to ignore these things by laborious tasks. that attempt only lasted a few days. it was horribly repetitive and extremely annoying - and not to mention unhealthy. teaching yourself to ignore yourself isn't quite a positive skill to learn.   back to where i started, avoiding sleep and despising the process, i began turning the noise off during the day. one morning i didn't turn the news on when i got up, and only realized that it was off when it was turned on. during the day, i was re-remembering those images, changing my perspective on them and realizing other definitions than the ones that made me cringe. suddenly i felt creative again. as an art student, you would think i still paint to this day, being it my love and what i went to college for, but you would be wrong. i very rarely paint as i feel my art lacks something important and i rarely have the burst of inspiration. however, once i began playing in the silence instead of trying to fight it, i felt i had something to say. i began to write more, as well. it makes no difference to me if any of it is ""good"", but the simple fact that i felt as if i had something to say is very important in my life. for everyone to realize we all have a unique perspective on life is very crucial, so for me personally it was a moment of self-realization.   once i embraced the silence, even the pain didn't sting as much.   i won't claim to say that i am completely comfortable with myself, which is all the silence is. there are pictures that make me cringe still, that still bring fresh tears to my eyes, but i can hold those moments dear, now.   i have even grown to accept silence from other people in better ways - lack of communication and response. i still go through the doubt and the fear, but the quiet isn't as scary as it used to be. i have also learned the appreciation of silence in other people. mindless ramblings aggrevate me, conversational competitions annoy me. they always have, but as a person who loves debate, i have always been a more aggressive conversationalist - touting people for pseudo-intelligence barely covering a thick gooey mass of insipidness. as egotistical a that sounds, everyone knows that person who has run just a bit faster, had life harder or makes more money than you - and enjoys telling you about all their better information, all of the time. now, i have swtiched to someone who speaks when i have something to say, not when i need to fill the void. that doesn't mean i am particulary quiet. if it's a subject that i know about, i am a very happily active participant. if something interests me, i am engrossed. i just don't waste my time on conversations on how crazier someone else's day was when clearly 75% of it is a lie.   until these recent days, i hadn't understood how much knowledge is gained from silence. i understood you could learn a vast amount about other people by merely listening to their words and watching thier body language, but i never thought i would come to the understandings i have about myself. i never thought the process could be as easy, either. if i had only realized at the beginning to just let go.   now, when i go to sleep, those images flash before my eyes which turn into stories, which turn into dreams i forget and then, i am awake. it's now a seamless process which requires no effort and is comfortable and soft.   i am coming to peace with who i am and i have come to peace with the silence.",27,female
50,"The trip to Vancouver was nice. The children were able to see all of their cousins and enjoyed playing with some of them nearly every one of the twelve days we were there. We also took them on the SkyTrain and the SeaBus and took them on a quick tour of Granville Street downtown and Pacific Centre this past Monday. They really enjoyed it. They installed a second SkyTrain line since we lived there and we went on it to get back home Monday. It’s hard to believe Brentwood Mall and Lougheed all have SkyTrain Stations now. Surrey Place Mall has been radically changed—it doesn’t even look the same anymore. There’s a new office tower and the exterior and interior have been completely remodelled. It looks cool, especially when the reflection of the SkyTrain shows in the glass exterior.  The day we arrived was a bit uncomfortable. There were twelve people in the van during our 45 minute ride from the airport to Surrey. It was hot in there and the humidity made it difficult to breathe easily. My parents had their thermostat at 28° that first night, so that didn’t help any either. That whole night I felt I was suffocating. I got used to it over the next day and was fine until I came home. The dry weather in Alberta the day we got back gave me a bloody nose. My nose doesn’t like the dry weather.  Anyhow, that wasn’t the hassle referred to in my title. The hassle was the stress of our trip back home. We were supposed to board our WestJet flight at 11:15 PST and arrive at 13:45 MST. At about twenty after eleven, they announced that as a result of the snowstorm (read 2-5 cm of snow) the night before and that was continuing yesterday depleted their de-icer supplies and our flight had been cancelled.  We were then instructed to travel back to the other end of the airport and pick up our ten pieces of luggage. We did this and put them on three baggage carts. Luckily, each cart had a basket where our children could sit, so we didn’t have to drag them behind us.  Then the two of us had to take the three carts down a switchback ramp to the arrivals level. That was a real hassle, but luckily a kind woman offered to push one of the carts. Once we arrived at the lower level, our luggage was loaded onto a charter bus. We were then bussed 1.5 hours to the Abbotsford airport where an alternate flight was suppose to leave at 14:00. The bus pulled in at 13:55. Luckily for us, the plane was waiting for a second bus, so we had time to grab something to eat.  We then had to load our ten pieces of  luggage from the bus back on to three baggage carts. The Abbotsford carts, unfortunately, did not have baskets in which our children could sit, so the two of us were pushing/pulling three carts and dragging two children. We had to check in all our baggage again and we finally boarded the plane at close to 15:00.  We arrived in Calgary around 17:30 MST, and after we filled our truck up with gas, we were back on the highway home around 18:15.  Originally, we planned to grab some groceries when we arrived in Lethbridge since we had eaten all our perishable food before we left. But since we arrived in Lethbridge at 20:30 and it was New Year’s Eve, none of the supermarkets were open. We ended up spending 35$ on two bags of groceries at Green’s Pop Shop.  I was just glad to get home.                 urlLink Read more...",33,female
51,"so my boss asked me what i want to do on the production today.  im not sure.  there are so many jobs that i cant think of one that i could do because i have no experience.    but then he posed this problem.  someone, experienced, needs to stay here and run the office.  if this person stays then they don't go to prauge.  but the trade off is that that person will be paid through out the production. those that go to prauge cant be garenteed that.    so its better for me to stay here because we have two things in development that i am part of and i would be paid more and longer, but then i forfit the experience of working on set and being over seas.  but my boss said i could come for a visit or something.  so i must decide.  the more logical is to stay here and make more money and work on the other projects.  but i need to get out of this office, damn!  but theni would be the boss here ;)  but then i lose prauge... hrmmmmm.. any advice?!",24,male
52,"Look Homeward, Angel   Although WB mainstay  Angel  celebrated 100 episodes  just last week ,  urlLink the show has been cancelled . Things move faster in tv than a demon out of Hellmouth. According to  Medialifemagazine.com :  ""There has been talk of special movie events next year, but nothing has been confirmed.  Angels  ratings are up more than 20 percent this year among adults 18-49, one of just two WB dramas to rise, but they are still relatively low. The WB evidently didnt see many long-term prospects for the show, which was barely renewed last season.""  Too bad. It was a surprise. Even the  urlLink Watch with Kristin  online gossip column wasn't aware. In a Friday column, she interviewed the show's vamp  David Boreanaz :   Kristin : One hundred episodes. Must feel good.    Boreanaz : Yes. I never imagined the show getting to 100 episodes. I only imagined getting the work done that was in front of me. When we started this journey four and a half seasons ago,  David Greenwalt  and  Joss Whedon  were like, 'One down, 99 to go,' and I was like, 'Whoa, whoa, whoa--I need to focus on this scene we're shooting on the rooftop.'

A statement from The WB:  For the last seven years Angel and Buffy the Vampire Slayer have been cornerstones of our network. The sum total of the work done on those shows has produced some of the proudest moments in our history. Like some of the great series that are leaving the air this year, including Frasier and Friends, the cast, crew, writers and producers of Angel deserve to be able to wrap up the series in a way befitting a classic television series and that is why we went to Joss to let him know that this would be the last year of the series on The WB. We have discussed continuing the Angel legacy with special movie events next year, which is still on the table. In a perfect world, all of these details would be completed before this information went to the press so that we could be definitive about the show's ongoing future. But in any case, we did not want to contemplate this being the last year of Angel without giving the show the option of crafting their own destiny for this character and for this series. David Boreanaz continues to be one of the finest, classiest and friendliest actors we have had the pleasure to work with and we hope that the relationship furthers from here.

56,"Letting Go   You wouldn’t think with the life I’ve had that I would have a problem letting go of people.  My life up until the last 8 years had been a series of moves: new places, faces, and experiences to keep me occupied.  I find however, that when it comes to those in my life, I have a distinct problem with letting them go quietly into that good night.  I believe it’s because I’ve come to crave permanency, some sense of stability to give roots to an otherwise unstable and unpredictable life.  I remember at 18 years of age, crying about college when others should have been happy, simply because I was too damn tired to pack up yet again, and leave behind those I had come to love and rely upon.    I have somehow found myself in an odd sort of limbo: fearful of losing those that I care about to a tomorrow that’s never promised and therefore fearful of growing close, and at the same time clinging to those that I’ve come to depend upon, no matter how much it may be time to move on.  Recent events have brought this problem to new light.  The first is my current employment.  When my boss hired me, he neglected to inform me that he was running for re-election this year.  To his credit, he ran unopposed four years ago and expected to coast by this year in the same fashion.  Let me explain: like the President, a District Attorney (DA) has to run every four years for his job.  Now, not many people have bosses that are re-elected every four years, but I guess I’m just one of the lucky ones.  And like the President, a new District Attorney is not at all obligated to keep any of the old staff.  Normally, your job is based on your performance.  My job however, is based on the whims of the newly elected.  And the election is less than two weeks away.  To add to the drama, the Judge that I have practiced solely in front of is being challenged as well.  The other two judges?  Their jobs are secure (running unopposed).  But the person challenging my Judge has a score to settle: he trounced her in the last election and she wants a rematch.  To truly honor these events we have a new urban legend currently circulating around our office (for the first one see “Things to Do in Albany . . . “): there was a DA’s office somewhere in south Georgia that had the same DA for almost 12 years.  But when the DA was defeated, the new DA held a staff meeting and fired all of the Assistant DA’s.  Variations abound, including one where the new DA calls in all the Assistants one at a time and tells them if they need to find new jobs or not.  Never being one to waver, I have fully thrown my support behind my boss, which means that if he loses, I could very well find myself out on my ass in January.  Luckily, I will have almost 6 months to look for a new job should he lose.  I have also thrown my support behind my Judge, which means if he loses, the new Judge will do her best to make my life a living hell.  I must admit the prospect of having to leave Albany scares me.  It’s not that I love it here: I bitch and complain about the lack of activities, and my friends miss me in Atlanta.  Maybe Greg, the Chief ADA (who’s  definitely  fired if the challenger wins – he’s the metaphorical Vice President), put it best when he said “everyone wants to leave on their own terms.”  I know that I’m eventually going to go, but I want to leave when I’m ready, not because some heinous power monger forced me out.  For the first time in almost a year, I’m scared: not scared that I’m going to be trapped down here, but scared that I won’t be trapped down here.  I realize that despite the fits and starts, I have a house I like, friends I care about, and a job I love.  I have a life here, and it hurts to think it could be taken away so soon.  Somehow things have grown familiar on me when I wasn’t looking.  They say familiarity breeds contempt, but in me its grown a sense of contentment, of completion.  And I don’t want to lose the faces in my office to new faces, or pack up yet again for greener pastures.    The second is the departure of my ex-boyfriend.  At first I was mightily relieved that he was removing himself from the vicinity.  Especially in light of rumors that had all but eviscerated my social life (see “The List”).  I was already looking forward to being able to visit my old haunts without feeling haunted by his presence.  I even endeavored to avoid bidding adieu, feeling that the event was wholly unnecessary considering everything that had preceded it.  However, a returned object and a note on my blog changed my mind.  I believed that the least I could do is say farewell to an individual that made the first months of my life here bearable and the last months a strive for independence and an exercise in strength.  I visited, with pretext in hand, ready to say my goodbyes and wish him well on his new life.  But as I spoke with him it dawned on me that his perfect life: the job, the new love, the escape from a town he had long outgrown, had very real, human flaws.  I believed him invincible, cocky, and formidable when I first met him.  The man I now spoke to was defeated, humble, and unsure of himself.  He was Samson, blinded and shorn.  And somehow, in that moment as I looked at him, he was all the more beautiful and real to me. It wasn’t until later that evening that I began to cry.  I would like to blame my maudlin mood on the martinis I had consumed earlier with friends, but I know that the bittersweet ache I felt wasn’t alcohol induced.  Although we hadn’t spoken in months, I realized that I would sorely miss this individual that had largely contributed to the last eight months of my life.  Like that last day of high school, I realized that the things that you had grown to dread, the moments that hurt you, are sometimes the things that you miss the most.  Maybe it’s because those things give us strength and define us just as much as the triumphs.  Or maybe people are just suckers for pain.  So now, in a moment of clarity, I will say this: I did love him once.  And when he left, I realized that there was nothing I could do to stop the people I had loved from leaving.  Breaking off from him, for whatever reason, didn’t kill the pain, it just masked it for a little while until I saw him again.  And that’s not such a bad thing.  I’ve learned that letting go of a person doesn’t mean you stop caring about them.  I guess that will come later.",27,female

58,"I almost had a date tonight.  Actually, fuck ""almost""; I  had  a date, for about half an hour.  It was going to be perfect.  Here I'd spent all last semester waiting for the right time, perfect place, best opening line, trying to calm my fears of rejection and step out of my comfort zone for once...Once!!  And today, I finally took that chance.  There have been signs all along.  She tried to hide her affection beneath a surly, tough exterior, but I saw beyond that.  We joked about the old hometown, laughed at how much we secretly wanted each other.  But underneath, I knew we were laughing about something real.    We planned to meet for beers, and those only lead to bad places; I was counting on it.  I figured such an invitation would be obvious in its entreaty.  After all, we ""joked"" that our movie and dinner the day after our last final was a date.  Clearly she was sending me signals that she was ready and waiting for me to initiate the next step.  Any remaining shards of doubt vanished when we had our lunch together this afternoon.  It was glorious.  We bonded; we shared things few others knew.  I looked at her; she looked at me.  She finished my olives, for god's sake!  If that's not a come-on, I don't know what is!  So when she called half an hour after our arrangements were made, I was excited.  I thought perhaps she couldn't wait to see me and wanted to move our plans up a bit; or maybe she had to tell me something too difficult to discuss in person.  I tried to sound nonchalant, telling her I was just ""reading the newspaper"" when I was actually admiring her picture in the law school's directory, as I have a tendency to do quite often, when all my life seems to shrink and the darkness curls up around me.    ""Listen, uhh.."" she said.  It sounded serious.  My heart was pounding; this was it!!  ""...I have bow out of tonight.""  Crushing.  Tumbling down a rocky mountain-side onto a torn, jagged terrain not entirely unlike the broken floor of Mordor.    ""Oh?"" I recovered quickly.    ""Yea, I forgot about this thing I'm doing with Mark tonight.""  Oh yes, this ""Mark"" person.  She refers to him on occasion, calling him her ""live-in.""  It's not entirely certain he even exists.  But I remained calm.    ""Okay.""  Did that sound too pained?  ""We'll definitely do it another time, though,"" she offered.  Was that hope I heard in her voice?    ""Alrighty.""  Like when you finally find the courage to admit the truth?!  Such was my date that wasn't.  I'll go on, somehow.  Probably get some coffee next door to the bar that was to be the site of our meeting.  But I won't go in, oh no.  Maybe come home and console myself with Queer As Folk's Season Two on DVD.    But I don't plan on letting myself get this hurt again, not for a very long time.",23,female

Power flickers and goes out in the neighboring buildings, and car alarms ring through the afternoon air.  Downtown  Parliament and College E  You find yourself in the heart of Cabbagetown. This is one of the oldest remaining residential areas of Toronto. It has been virtually untouched by time. Buildings, their architecture dating them back to the turn of the century, rise all along the narrow one-way streets which criss-cross through this area. However, a new surge of 'yuppies' moving into the area has brought forth a flow of change to the old homes. Entire homes are renovated to a more, modern decor. The streets are now being filled with parked BMWs and Mercedes. Upscale boutiques and cafes are springing up on every corner. The more traditional residents have started to complain, creating a storm of controversy over the historic nature of Cabbagetown. In this case, however, tradition seems to be taking a back seat to wealth and power.

Isobel hurries to take a look around and then moves towards the crowd that has gathered  Erick moves down the street, not running, not panicked. Like a king he seems to move, but then here he pretty much is. However anger is on his face as he surveys the area and prepares for the fall out. Car alarms and shocked screams and yells fill the air, but overshadowing all this commotion is the roar of flames, green flames actually, which currently completely engulf the old McDulan family grocery. The glass of nearby buildings and car windows litter the streets.  Silvius slips into his Robes of Office and into Judge Mode!

His face flush with excitement. Doing a fine job representing the do-nothing-voyeur-public in times of crisis.  Erick moves down the street, scanning for only a moment. He taps a few people as he moves by them, the most Irish from the look of it. Directing people to take the wounded to the other side of the street. That thin line of anger still there. The cops are going to show up for this one. He knows it and it pleases him not at all. A few others directed to find the owners of those cars and get the alarms shut off before he moves to where he directed the injured to be taken, god knows when the paramedics will arrive and he is assuming people need help now.  Isaac scans around and makes his way over to Isobel and asks, ""All right, since you got here before me, what do you think happened?""  Isobel shakes her head and points towards the back of one of the estates where her little apartment is... ""my god I was there only 30 minuets ago... "" she shivers and then adds quickly ""I need to help.. "" with that she goes over to one of the ladies and helps her up from the ground, the poor dear is pretty banged up but she can walk.. carefully she leads the lady to a safe looking stoop, assuring her she needs to have some one look at those cuts...  The interesting thing is, no cops or firemen seem to be anywhere around here. But what's more is the strange green color that seems to permeate the flames. As erick directs the irish folk, they nod, some growing calmer as the seems to recognize the man a bit. They move off to help those they can.  Compton fishes one of those cheap disposeable cameras form his parka's pocket along with a small flask. FIrst he takes a belt of the hooch, to keep the home fires burning and then starts taking random snap shots of the chaos and carnage around him. zzip *CLICK* zzzip *CLICK*  Spotting Isobel Erick moves to the lady she has helped. ""Take her two doors up lass. We need all of them together. See if ya can find anyone else with first aid trainin as well."" He then moves back there.  Admiistering the little first aid he can. Actually tossing one man the keys to his house and telling him where the first aid kit is. He finally seems to notice the green flame and mutters something about old copper wiring.  Isobel nods her head and hurries to obey. guiding the lady to a safe place and shouting in relief as she spots one of the locals who works at the hospitial, he is hurrying towards Erick  Isaac shoves through the crowd himself and looks upon the scene. Since there are no police around, he takes a quick scan for damages... and then begins talking to people that seem to have had property damaged, especially cars....  Jim arrives from the south. Jim has arrived.  Jim walks through the intersection of Parliament and College, to see several people he recognizes. He tosses a raised eyebrow to Isobel as he passes.  Isobel works to get small children reunited with their parents. She is moving through out the milling mass, her heels a real pain in the butt  Jim walks north along Parliament to Wellesley. Jim has left.  Everyone on the streets has relatively minor injuries, glass, cuts, that sort of thing. the blast seems to have been engineered to engulf the building with little collateral damage.  Erick does not even look at the man. The first aid kit is his major concern. He probably knows him from years ago when his sister ran the place, if he's that old. He works on the wounds until the kit arrives and he can do it properly. One of the men leading people over is directed. ""Go ta tha pub and get Seamus to get a cop here. An Irish one if possible, if there are still any onna force. But this shite we canna handle on our own. Not until later."" The look in his face says someone is going to bleed for this, but that is later, this is now.  Jim arrives from the north. Jim has arrived.  Isaac looks at Erick as he is done making his rounds. ""What the hell are you talking about? You're making this sound like terrorist attack.""  Isobel looks up and actually spots Jim, she waves to him ""Jim Jim! Help me please, I can na find this little ones Mother.."" she winces as she holds the crying child.. trying to keep up with the dirty faced red haired tyke.....  Jim yells articulately. ""WHAT THE FUCK!?""  Swan arrives from the west. Swan has arrived.  Jim goes about trying to pull the worst injured out of the rubble.  Erick looks up at the disheveled man who adresses him and just smiles grimly. ""You a reporter or a cop lad? If ya are piss off I got me hands full here if ya didna notice. If ya aren't then it ain't terorists I'm worried aboot."" He ducks at the second explosion, almost seeming to before it happens. ""God damn it!"" That dark look again on his face.  Isaac notes the pre-emptive reaction and says, ""You know something about this, tell me what the hell is going on now, or I'll just have the cops take you in for questioning also.""  Isobel is trying to help up one of the older men who usually sits outside and plays checkers.. she still has the crying dirty faced child on her hip,.. bouncing him gently as she steadies Old Mat... ""its ok darln' we will find your mudder not to fret.... "" as she speaks Old Mat looks up and blinks ""why lass my mudder has been dead these last 22 years ... you sure you are not the one who took a brick to the head  Siomen arrives from the west. Siomen has arrived.  The building explodes again, seems possibly a gas main or the like finally gave to the intense heat. sirens are heard in the distance, growing closer as the entire neighborhood, the irish portion at least, seems to come to life to help. Neighbors futilely attempt to cool the fire with garden hoses and fire extinguishers, others form a bucket brigade. Yet more seem to come from the clinic, taking in the wounded there.  Isobel blinks in confussion and then has to laugh, but it is short lived as the second explossion hits... ""i.. I was talking to the child Mat..."" she sighs and then shakes her head. ""nar mind.. is going to be ok. come on hurry .. hurry we do nah need to take more damamge  Compton keeps working his tourist trinket camera, snapping shots of the human conflict that is unravelling itself out on the street. He stands safely behind the scene next to some battered parked cars.  Swan moves to the periphery of the gathered group, speaking into a cellphone, as he scans the area for imminent signs of danger.  Jim grabs what people he can, and begins to pull them towards the clinic, he hollers at the top of his lungs. ""Is there a fuckin' doctor out here? Come on you fuckers!"" He glances over to Compton and yells at the man. ""You! Yeah you, motherfucker! Drop the goddamn camera and give these people a hand you sadistic fuck!""  Hept-Seshet arrives from the west. Hept-Seshet has arrived.  Erick stands as the people atre taken to the clinic. They're better off there. He looks at Isaac. What I know is that two explosions just hit me fuckin' neighborhood and you're gettin in me face. Now get the hell outta me face, and if'n yer smart out of me neighborhood before I stick something hard and big and possibly flamable up yer arse. This is not the time to be accusin me of shite.  Siomen wanders down the street, drawn by the sirens and explosions, just another gawking fool Swan finishes his conversation and pockets his phone.  Escalus has arrived.  Isaac looks at the truck pulling up and waves the person emerging over to him. He then turns back to erick and says, ""Are you threatening me now? So now they have to question you /and/ hold you on account of verbal assualt?""  Isobel blinks as she hears Erick being yelled at by Isaac but she does not interfere, instead she sets the small child down and begins to move her way back towards the cars where the man with the camera is snapping away like some voyeur tourist...  Swan walks west along College to Jarvis. Swan has left.  Erick smiles at the man. ""I ain't threatenin ya welp. I'm givin ya friendly advice. Ya ain't a cop or ya'd be helpin out. Yer steppin on toes here, so either get ta helpin, or get tha fook out. Ain't noone here want ta deal with yer attitude, you're causin people ta suffer. An before ya threaten me ya might want ta keep in mind that ya accused me of some pretty nasty shit happenin ta a business I have interest in."" He's losing his temper and his patience. But the man in front of him doesn't hold it for long, his head swivels and he begins to move in the same direction as Isobel, growling under his breath about vultures as the rude man is forgotten in favor of a much more satisfying target.  Giving the hecklers no mind, Compton continues to document the crisis. Sure it's thankless work. Nobody cares for the paparazzi during the mess, but afterwards when Mom's read the Time magazine in line at the supermarket, and comment how tragic the images are or when the CEO's on the shitter reading that months National Geographic he realizes how brave his country men are to have done what they did in times of need, all because of the pictures. North America the contradiction. No one wants to love the ones who get the picture, they just want to see the images. The photographer and the photograph have become alienated from each other. The images must be pure. They must come from no where in to the media. Compton is just one of the thankless scum who feed Canada its hypocritical sense of moralness.   Jim drags those he can out of the rubble, and begins administering what rudimentary first aid he can amidst the chaos. He tears up clothing to make tourniquets, elevates injured limbs, and talks softly to those on the brink. On occasion he pulls a silver flask from his jacket, and allows an injured soul a slug from its contents. All the while, he is alternately screaming at others to help out, get supplies, and occasionally, to 'fuck right off'. His presence is not one of leadership, but some stunned bystanders seem to acknowledge his cries, and join him in aiding the injured.  Hept-Seshet looks around and she grabs a few people and she points them at some people, ""You, put pressure on that wound like this."" and she shows the person how and then she points the other person at another wounded person, ""You, hold pressure on her headwound."" she then stalks over to Erick, her little form likely like a puff of edierfdown but the fury in her golden eyes packs a whallop, ""Ypou don't worry about the stupid scut snapping pictures! Help with the wounded, let him be a jackass, the hurt people need help more!"" she souts before turning to help more, organizng more bystanders. Isobel has partially disconnected.  Ryan arrives in a blue-green chevy, pulling as close as he can to the scene without interfering with police or individuals trying to get out of the area. When he gets as close as he can with his car, Ryan then parks and gets out to wander into the area on foot. He retrieves a small disposable camera from the vehicle before making his way in Isaac's direction. ""Tragedy makes everyone edgy,"" Ryan says as if to catch Isaac's attention, ""Best to leave him be. As Ted's elsewhere, it'd be helpful if you got a few pictures as we do what we can to help."" Ryan then offers Isaac the camera before gazing about the scene to decide how best help can be given.  Siomen stands and watches, he shifts his backpack slightly and blinks at the scene, he seems rather quiet and just takes it all in. He doesn't seem to recognize anyone, nor want to be bothered by anyone either.  Isaac grunts and takes the camera. ""Your the damn reporter, you should be doing this."" Still, he makes sure to get a snapshots of the strange flames coming from the store, the helpers, and any apparent damage caused while standing back.  The sirens finally arrive, not too bad of a response time. Though judging from the fierce flames,the damage is done, the fire fighters will have a time of containing the blaze, let alone saving any of the building. And if anyone was inside... it'd be a good bet they aren't alive any longer. But none the less, the fire trucks pull through the crowd and Toronto's Bravest scatter to their work. 3 ambulances pull into the scene as well, and the paramedics start to take over the first aid.  Skip arrives from the north. Skip has arrived.  John arrives from the west. John has arrived.  Silvius pages: okay, Isobel is kicking at you and making a grab for the camera, do me a favor and roll me a   Compton rolls dexterity+dodge privately to Silvius at diff 6. For a total of 2 success(es).  Silvius pages Compton and Isobel: Okay, Isobel's action was successful, so if is could pose it, and Compton, when your pose comes up, pose your reaction, yet failure to resist please ;)  Isobel slips through the cars towards Compton, gritting her teeth as she suddenly goes into action. With a whirl of her feet she suddenly slams Compton with a flying drop kick... the camera sails into the air....... and falls smashing to the ground as she strikes with incredible agility... and jumps back...  Erick blinks as he is dissrespected in hsi neighborhood again. ""Lass. If ya interfere with tha professionals doing tha medical work again I will see yer bitch ass taken in fer it. Don'tcha give me another god damn order, and what I said about getting the fook out goes just as well fer you."" He looks back at issac, too many people with Cameras. So long as he don't take yer picture doin tha let him keep his guy gettin the pictures is actually helping. Then damn the tux he's moving to the front of one of the bucket brigades, until the hoses can get to work.  the hoses finally get hooked up and the water starts flying. The few fire personnel that are not on hose teams start to usher the civilians back, breaking up the bucket brigades with words of appreciation. Off i the distance more sirens can be heard approaching. The rescue personnel finally get the wounded under control, thanking those who have been helping but asking them to back off and allow them to do their jobs.  Compton, who is just doing his part to record the incredible vitality of the human spirit for prosperity spots the crazy woman heading at him at the last moment. He tries to move out of the way, but being older and heavier doesn't have much of a chance against an unprovoked attack like this. Isoble does her thing. $12.99 camera skitters away, and the big guy stands there just looking mighty insulted. ""Crazy cunt."" is all Compton deadpans.  Jim stands aside, allowing the crews to do their jobs. He looks around for a place that needs a hand. His jacket, hat and gloves are gone now, given to some more deserving soul. He stands caked in dust and slushy mud, coughing and shivering, his empty flask in hand and a glazed look in his eyes as he surveys the mayhem.  A bloodied and bruised redheaded boy pushes his way past the medics that try to tend to him. he looks beaten, not from the explosion, but more like he had just recently had his ass kicked good. He stumbles over to Erick and slumps against him, whispering to the man.  Hept-Seshet shakes her head a bit as she watches the mess going on and she sighs as she looks around.  Ryan simply nods to Isaac as he says, ""Yeah, good afternoon to you as well."" As Compton is 'attacked', Ryan frowns and mutters to Isaac, ""Uh...keep taking pictures. I'll smooth things over..."" He then steps aside to allow any firefighters and paramedics who might have arrived to pass without causing an obstruction. After all, there are plenty of stories of those who meant to help accidently causing more injury through their own incompetence. Instead, Ryan seems to quote as if his words were important, ""After all, such photographs hold a great importance. Despite those who see the world through only the glassy world of television or the dry site of paper, there is still a need for them to be involved in such tragedies. How can one mourn the fallen if there is nothing to which their memory is held? How can one truly understand that which the police and firefighters must put up from day to day? How can one truly appreciate the safety which they take for granted? No, continue with your important role and you will be overlooked, but appreciated nonetheless.""  Siomen watches in amazement at the scene. all this noise, burning, smoke... and now some fighting. He just shakes his head slightly in wonder.  Nothing helps people feel more calm and secure than to see a lawyer running towards the scene of an accident. Maybe not, but Skip Tanner thinks so. Attracted to the sounds of sirens and such like a deer to headlights, he slows his pace as he nears the scene. ""All right, Skip, this is it. Gotta look good here"" He takes a moment to check his hair, adjust his suit and make sure that there arent any sweat stains from the run. ""Good, looking sharp. Important to look professional."" Clearing his throat, he takes on a very serious expression and speaks to an imaginary person to practice his lines, ""Im very sorry for your loss, maam and/or sir, but it is important at times like these to protect your interests and the interests of your family. You dont want to miss out on any reparation to damages"" As he gets on to the more legal terms, he starts mumbling incoherently as if hes practiced the lines many times before until he finally just nods, ""All right, sounds good. Lets get this show on the road."" Adjusting his tie, he walks calmly towards the scene. This just might be a great opportunity for a little name and card dropping. Nearing the chaos, his carefully practiced lines start falling apart since Skip has never actually used them in a real life situation. Standing awkwardly in the middle of everything, he just dumbly asks, ""Uh.does anybody need a lawyer?""  John blinks at the giant clusterfuck as he approaches down the street. He slips into an alley and moves through it as best he can toward the fire without being seen. The man blinks his eyes and they change colour briefly before taking on their normal blue. They are still somehow... different. He moves toward the crowd now quietly, keeping an eye out for something.  Isaac looks at John as he approaches and waves. He then tosses the camera to Ryan and says, ""Right. Here, you sway off the vengeful drunkish soccer watchers while I do something else."" He pads over to Skip and points to where the store owner or however looks like they might have been hurt is currently and says, ""There you go, a real crisis. There's some people that might need your help.""  Erick holds the boy to him, managing to get the blood smeared on his tux, seems to have forgotten he was wearing the damn thing. He picks the lad up, as he does he reaches into his pocket tossing a bill at Compton. ""That should pay for camera."" then he carries the boy to the nearest paramedic. Speaking to him softly. When he is done he makes sure the boy is in the poper hands and watches him, that look of rage on his face darker now.  Crisis always brings the nut jobs out it seems. Not out of the proverbial woodwork but out of what would normally be sane, moral people. Compton realizes he's been too close too long with such people. People who dream of greatness through out their mundane days, only to have something extreme happen and take licence to act out. He uses a good dose of rationality, zips up his parka, stuffs his hands in to his pockets and turns to go, only breifly pausing to pick up the battered camera.  ~FIN~",25,male

The Danforth Music Hall, which started life as Allen's Danforth Theatre in 1920, has been closed since the third week of February.   Since 1998 the Music Hall has been a member of the Festival Cinemas chain, showing second run films mostly with the occasional concert or play thrown into the schedule. It is the last operational theatre built in the Allen's chain. All its sister theatres have been either demolished or converted into other uses.   No details are being provided as to the reason for the closing. The message on the Festival Cinemas' Hotline (416-690-2600) states simply that the theater is closed.   Given the recent collapse of the Uptown and ceiling falling at the Bloor cinema, Toronto cinema fans have reason to be worried about this old movie house.

""      I do not exactly know what the director is trying to get at here. He speaks of the constitution at the Apex of this pyramid then the Law on Human Rights at the  upper middle  and 'other laws, such as Law on Women Interests Protection, Law on Teenagers Protection and Law on the Disabled, at the  lower middle  and all regulations on citizen's rights protection at the bottom' Feng tried to explain.   I do not particularly care if he is taking the famed Chinese ""scientific"" approach a little to far it is just good that this fairly foreign concept, ""Human Rights"" is getting aired at all.",47,male
75,"The junkie who sells stolen steaks. At least I'm pretty sure he's a junkie. Was pretty sure when his pants fell down just before he entered the door. He put down his shopping bags as he slowly pulled his pants up. He comes in the bar. Starts hitting up Steve the bartender. Steve has seen the stolen steak guy dealer before, and he doesn't want any stolen steaks. He just wants the fucker to leave. I want the guy to leave too. The guy wants $80 for $160 worth of steak. But he won't take ""no"" for an answer.   There are four guys at the bar, including me, and one lovely girl. I'm afraid the steak dealer is gonna scare the chick away. Hell, it's just nice to look at something other than the TV and a bunch of guys while you're drinking. You dig? And this girl has lovely breasts. And I can't help but looking at them while she writes in her little notebook.   And the steak dealer junkie motherfucker is getting in the way of my high. Here I am just wanting to get lost in the beauty of a single girl at the bar while drinking a beer. But this fucker is getting me down. My neck's tightening up. I think putting my hands behind the guy's head and forcing it into the bar repeatedly. I think about doing this because this guy is a lowlife scum. Jesus, peddling fucking stolen steaks to support your habit.   I try to think good thoughts. I try to focus on the girl. I want to be good. I try to be good, but one of these days I feel like I'm going bezerk and pull Billy Jack on someone. It's back to whole duality of man concept that I touched on last week with that bit from ""Full Metal Jacket."" The Jekyll and Hyde thing. I think we all have a bit of that in us. The good and evil. Dark and light. Ying and Yang and all that... I could go into this further, but I think the results might be futile at this present time.   Anyway, so the junkie asks Steve for some more ice for his ice tea. Why can't this fucker just leave, man? Just grab your Macy's bags full of steaks and get the fuck out of the bar, man. But he starts to roll a cigarette. He rolls it slow. He picks up his bags and heads for the door. But first he stops right near where the girl is sitting. He asks Steve for a book of matches. He puts a quarter on the bar. I'm inching my ass off the stool, ready to pounce on the fucker if he tries any bullshit with the girl. Fuck, just let the girl drink in peace. I'm sure she doesn't appreciate some junkie-ass stolen steak dealer rubbing up against her bare shoulder.   But finally the fucker leaves. He goes up the stairs outside. He stands at the top of the stairs. Puts his bags down. Takes a good few minutes to light his cigarette. I'm grateful the guy is gone.",34,male

79,"OK, this creeped me out. A bit too close to home, folks.     Dirksen Federal Building   Chicago, IL   Photo ©  urlLink Chicago Tribune      Ill. Man Accused of Courthouse Bomb Plot   By NATHANIEL HERNANDEZ Associated Press Writer    Published August 5, 2004, 5:03 PM CDT    CHICAGO -- A convicted counterfeiter with an apparent grudge against the courts was arrested Thursday on charges of plotting to blow up a federal courthouse, but he never actually had materials to make a truck bomb, authorities said.  Prosecutors said Gale William Nettles, 66, was arrested with a pickup truck containing 1,500 pounds of fertilizer that he allegedly thought was volatile ammonium nitrate, the farm chemical used to blow up the Oklahoma City federal building.  Nettles had planned to sell the chemical to terrorists who would blow up the Dirksen federal building, U.S. Attorney Patrick J. Fitzgerald said in announcing the charges Thursday. But all the other people involved, including the ""terrorists"" and the people who sold him the fertilizer, were cooperating witnesses or federal agents, Fitzgerald said.  Nettles told the undercover agent he could make a 3,000-pound fertilizer bomb.  ""He had a rational plan to build a bomb. We weren't going to wait to see if it would work,"" Fitzgerald said.  Timothy McVeigh used a bomb made of 4,800 pounds of ammonium nitrate to blow up the Oklahoma City federal building in 1995, killing 168 people.  Nettles was arrested at a park early Thursday with the pickup truck when he met the undercover agents who he thought were terrorists, according to the criminal complaint. The fertilizer he obtained in the sting does not have the explosive potential of ammonium nitrate.  According to the complaint, Nettles met July 26 with an undercover agent he thought was a member of a terrorist group. In a recorded meeting, Nettles said he had a half ton of ammonium nitrate in New Orleans that he could have in Chicago in two days and that he had a target in mind -- the U.S. courthouse downtown, the complaint said.  A federal magistrate Thursday ordered Nettles held until a detention hearing Tuesday. No plea was entered, and defense attorney John Theis declined to comment afterward.  Nettles was released from prison in 2003 after serving time for counterfeiting and apparently retained a grudge against the court system, Fitzgerald said. The Dirksen federal building in downtown Chicago houses federal criminal and civil courts and the U.S. attorney's office.  Fitzgerald said Nettles was not working with any other groups but had asked cooperating witnesses about contacting Al-Qaida and Hamas.  Nettles also had a previous conviction for armed robbery in Cook County and was on parole at the time of his counterfeiting arrest. In 2001 he claimed he had mental disabilities, according to court documents.  ""He's 66 and he's spent -- probably conservatively -- 45 of those years in prison,"" said attorney Ronald J. Clark, who represented Nettles in the counterfeiting case. ""It surprises me that Gale would seriously be involved in something of this magnitude,"" Clark said. He described Nettles' counterfeiting as a ""fairly pathetic attempt.""  Nettles had been living at a transient hotel in Chicago since his release following the counterfeiting sentence, authorities said. Sam Gelles, 35, another hotel resident, said Nettles was an introverted computer whiz who went by the nickname ""Pops."" ""You couldn't really read him,"" Gelles said.

Promising start last night by rookie Clint Nageotte (pronounced na-zhot) who gave up 0 runs in six innings.  The largest Mariner problem has been synchronizing offense and defense (one has one f, the other has two).  Mariner's starters Joel Pinero and Freddy Garcia each have excellent ERA's, yet abismal records.  Lastly, the Pistons can beat the Lakers, and I see the finals as a tossup.  Anyone that thinks the Lakers are going to coast by anther lame-ass eastern conference team has another thing coming.  That thing is the ridiculously powerful Wallace and Wallace combo, Tayshaun Prince guarding Kobe, and my boy Rip Hamilton who took a page out of Jesse T's book and wears the Hannibal mask on his way to being the Piston's postseason leading scorer.

83,"My family asked me to choose some verses to read at my grandma's mass tomorrow. The priest is going to read the gospel verses and I'm going to read the other ones:   ""Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me. In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am. You know the way to the place where I am going.""  Thomas said to him, ""Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?""  Jesus answered, ""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you really knew me, you would know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.""  -John 14:1-7   Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God. Not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us.  -Romans 5:1-5   Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood since the earth was founded? He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth, and its people are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like a canopy, and spreads them out like a tent to live in. He brings princes to naught and reduces the rulers of this world to nothing. No sooner are they planted, no sooner are they sown, no sooner do they take root in the ground, than he blows on them and they wither, and a whirlwind sweeps them away like chaff.   ""To whom will you compare me? Or who is my equal?"" says the Holy One.   Lift your eyes and look to the heavens: Who created all these? He who brings out the starry host one by one, and calls them each by name. Because of his great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing. Why do you say, O Jacob, and complain, O Israel, ""My way is hidden from the Lord; my cause is disregarded by my God""?  Do you not know? Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary, and his understanding no one can fathom. He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak. Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall; but those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.  -Isaiah 40:21-31",25,female
84,"*****  After my book group on Wednesday evening, I received the following message on my voicemail: ""Last week you chose door number 3 but opted out. Better make it this week"". It was TJ MAXX, harassing me about going dancing with him at some new bar-club on Polk. Since I already had plans to take Thursday off, I called him back and told him I'll pick him up at 10:45. Despite my initial hesitation about going and my predictions of spending 3 hours watching scenesters trying to out-cool each other, it turned into an pretty fun night. Me, TJ, TJ's ex MK, JJ Fad's ex and her new girlfriend, all completely smashed and dancing to early 90's hits by such talented singer-songwriters as En Vogue, Digital Underground and Sir Mix-A-Lot as well as some new stuff. I was seeing double by the time we left, so I asked TJ to drive. At his house 15 scary minutes later, he revealed that he, too, was completely wasted and was 'just trying to do what all the other cars were doing'. Thank you lord jesus for getting us safely to TJ's abode. So that was Wednesday.   On Thursday, anticipating a day of much needed rest and relaxation, I drove home, called in sick, and got into my soft warm bed. Ten minutes later, Marcus called and told me to be ready to go to the sweatshop in 45 minutes. Fuck!!, I thought, that's why I took the day off, not to nurse my monster hangover. At the factory, Marcus explained to me how the whole operation works. I tried to pay attention, but all the machines were too intriguing, so every ten minutes I took breaks and ran around the floor. I had to hold myself back from jumping into the enormous piles of felt and cotton scraps on the floor. After that, Marcus got me my very own Costco card and we went out to lunch in chinatown. Then it was time to go to chem class.   It's finally Friday and I'm counting minutes until I can go home and veg out in my pajamas. Mike is back on Sunday.

91,"Bill Gates died and went to heaven.  On arrival, he had to wait in the reception area. This was the size of Queensland, with literally millions of people milling about, living in tents with nothing to do all day. Food and water were being distributed from the backs of trucks; staffers with clipboards battled their way through the crowds. Booze and drugs were being passed around, fights were commonplace. Sanitation conditions were appaling, the whole thing looked like Woodstock gone metastic.  Bill lived in a tent for three weeks until, finally, a staffer approached him - a young man in his late teens with acne scars wearing a blue T - shirt with TEAM PETER written on it.  ""Hello."" said the staffer in a bored, bereaucratic sounding voice. ""My name is Gabriel and I'll be your induction co - ordinator.""  Bill started to ask a question but Gabriel interrupted him. ""No, I'm not the Archangel Gabriel, I'm just a guy from Melbourne named Gabriel. I died in a car crash at the age of 17. Now give me your name, last name first, unless your Chinese, in which case it's first name first.""  ""Gates, Bill""  Gabriel checked his clipboard.  ""Why are all these people here? Where is St Peter? Where are the pearly gates?""  Gabriel ignored his questions until he located his entry on his clipboard. ""It says here you were the president of a large software company. Is that right?""  ""Yes.""  ""Well then, do the maths, chip head. When heaven opened, only 100 people or so died every day. St Peter could handle them all himself, no problems. No there are over 5 billion people on earth. Jesus, when God said go forth and multiply, he didn't mean like rabbits! Now around 10,000 people die every hour, over a quarter of a million people every day. Do you think Peter can meet them all personally?""  ""I guess not.""  ""You guessed right."" So Peter had to franchise the operation. He's now the CEO of Team Peter Enterprises Inc. Just sits in the Corporate Headquarters and sets policy. Franchisees like me handle the actual inductions. Your paperwork seems to be inorder and with a background like yours, you'll be getting a plum job assignment.""  ""Job assignment?""  ""Of course. Did you expect to spend the rest of eternity sitting on your arse and drinking ambrosia? Heavens a big operation. And you have to pull your weight."" Gabriel had Bill sign a form in triplicate, then tore out the middle copy and handed it to him. ""Take this form to Induction Centre 23 and meet up with your Occupational Orientator. His name is Abraham.""  Bill started to ask a question. Gabriel interrupted ""No, he's not that Abraham.""  Gates walked down a long, muddy trail until he came to Induction Centre 23. After a mere six hour wait he met Abraham.  ""Heaven is centuries behind in it's data processing infrastructure."" explained Abraham. Were still doing everything on paper. It takes us a week to process new entries. Your job will be to supervise Heaven's new Data Processing Centre. We're putting in the largest computing facility in the history of creation.

It was a truly huge facility, 100 times the size of the SCG, with workmen crawling all over it. And in the middle, arranged in huge circles around a massive, house sized mainframe, were half a million computers in neat rows. Half a million.  ""Macintoshes!"" exclaimed Bill, horrified.  ""All running ClarisWorks software. Not a single byte of Microsoft code. "" said Abraham.  The thought of spending the rest of eternity using products hed spent his life trying to destroy was too much for Bill. ""What about PC's?"" he exclaimed. ""What about Windows? What about Excel?

Violation of this rule is harmful to the learning process and disrespectful to both faculty and fellow students.

95,"Well today is the last day I will be at my parents’ house for quite some time. I am undecided as to when I will be coming back here again. I was thinking I should come up for Christmas- as I have been given that week off work as holiday leave. However, I think it would be way too hot for me to come up at that time of year- in the middle of summer. It was even a bit hot for me to come up this time around- and it is the end of Autumn/beginning of winter! Oh well I will decide something sooner or later. The other option is to come up next August. My partner however in the meantime wants us to go to Bali for a week or so, or somewhere else overseas.   The prices for an overseas holiday are comparable to that of a domestic holiday, so going to either destination is not a problem financially. Perhaps I will go to both- that is, go overseas, and then come up to see my parents in August. I was kind of planning on going somewhere during December anyway in Victoria- provided it is nice and warm- or even to Tasmania. I discovered a tourist brochure for the Spirit of Tasmania, and they were offering 7day holidays, including travel (in which you can take your car for free!) for just over $100. That is an absolute bargain! I will definitely have to go there one of these days as well.   Before that as well, I also have the week of the Melbourne Cup and the Spring Racing Carnival off as holiday leave as well. I am not sure if I will go to the races, or go somewhere in Victoria either. We will see how we go with that. Another factor in all of this as well is that I have an outstanding tax office debt of around $7000- so we’ll see how much they demand to take from my salary each fortnight before I make any further plans about holidays and all that.  Anyway, today I got up at 6:30- and it was nice and sunny again. And as my first day up here, the first thing I felt when I got up was a nice warm breeze blowing over me. I will certainly miss that when I get to Victoria. We never get nice, warm moist winds down there…. Only hot and dry.  I got to the bus stop just before 10am. We got there by taxi. There is something to be said for the lack of hygiene amongst taxi drivers in general (well the ones that I have encountered anyway!), but this one- oh my god…. Let’s just say I was glad to get out of the cab! Anyway at the bus stop I thought I saw someone I went to school with. I did not say hello though. I am a bit silly about things like that. If I am not 100% sure that someone is who I think they are- I will not go up to them at all- for fear of getting it wrong and making a complete idiot of myself. Anyway next time I am up there I will go around town and make sure I say hello. By the way, I am still not 100% sure who that girl was that was talking to me in the shops the other day!  The bus came early, and we got on. I do not mind long bus trips like this, but my mother seems to. We pulled into Airlie Beach and picked up some passengers. It was really nice there- and I was looking at the tourists everywhere along the street. I think it would be cool to just get away by myself for a holiday one of these days. I do not think it would happen though. I would not be able to stay away from my partner for too long (missable!) and I could not come up here for a trip by myself anyway- as my family would want me to come up and visit them as well (and I would want to stay there as well- hey free accommodation!)   After that, we continued our journey south. I read a book that mum had given- Crossing Over by John Edward. It was an interesting read- however I found it to be very similar to watching the television show in parts. I actually do believe in the things he writes about. Call me crazy, but sometimes I do feel as though the presence of those departed are around me. Also, at funerals- I never feel upset. I usually (well ALWAYS) get the feeling that the spirit of the deceased is around me, and that they are very much happier where they are. So I am the one trying to hide my smile when everyone else is upset. I do feel it is inappropriate that I feel strangely happy at funerals for those that die- but the way I see it- they are no longer suffering on earth anymore, and they are much happier where they are now. I don’t think many people understand the way I think about these things- and I know I have offended many as well. But hey- each to their own- I respect the thoughts of others on this matter, and thankfully, most respect mine as well.  Back to the bus trip! We stopped for lunch at some place called Koumala. I wondered if this was some sort of Greek name or is this meant something naughty in another language… probably not I imagined… Koumala is really just a roadhouse with really expensive food in it. I ended up just getting some more lollies to eat. I was not going to pay excessive amounts of money for something that was likely to taste crap.  Back on the bus again, and we passed through some more really really small towns. The landscape did not change much once we passed through Sarina and left the sugar cane country. Near sunset I looked out the window and saw a couple of wild kangaroos. Some of the backpackers on the bus were a bit excited about that!  Then finally, at about 6:15, we pulled into Rockhampton. It was still really warm there, probably mid 20’s. I went to get some milk from Doblos- a local independent retailer. I had wanted to go there because during summer, I saw on  a current affairs show (Today Tonight) that they were offering fuel vouchers (save 10c off per litre) to anyone who bought over $30 worth of goods from their stores. It made the news show because the local Safeway (locally known as Woolworths here) was matching it. (Everywhere else in Australia the discount is 4c per litre). Anyway I was disappointed to learn that the discount here was now only 6cper litre, and only able to be used at local petrol stations. Oh well, next time.  From there we went and visited one of my cousins and had dinner. I don’t know what it is about Queenslanders- but they seem to make interesting interpretations of all sorts of food. This time it was Lemon Chicken, but not how I am used to it in Melbourne. The lemon sauce here seemed to be creamy in texture and looks, and taste. This was something a bit unusual for me, as I am used to the lemon sauce being transparent, and a yellow colour. The rice was much starchier than I am used to as well. I should not bitch about this though, as I used to make food like this as well while I was still living up here. Anyway, because I was so hungry, I had 2 servings.   After that, it was off to my grandparents (otherwise known as ‘the farm’.) I suppose I cannot really call it my grandparents, as my grandfather (on mothers side of the family) died over 7 years ago, and my grandmother lives here with 4 of her sons (my uncles)- who have never permanently moved away (that I am aware of at least!). So I think I will just call it the farm from now onwards.   On the way out, I was absolutely amazed by all the stars I could see in the sky. I had thought I could see a lot of stars from the Western suburbs- but it is nothing compared to what you can see from this part of the world. There was no moon in the sky at all, yet the sky seemed to have a whitish tinge to it- not absolutely black. I could clearly see the milky way- beautiful in its appearance. I thought I could even see the comet that is visiting our skies at the moment! By the time we reached the farm though (just after 10:30pm), I did not wish to go sky gazing anymore. I just wanted to go to bed.   I went straight to bed- without even having a shower or washing my hair. I never do this, especially when my hair has freeze gel through it (and has had it in there all day!) But I was just too tired. Just after 11pm- I closed my eyes and went to sleep.",24,male

100,"I can't go without mentioning all the unintentional Matt (Wilson) coverage. I am saddened because Brad looked like shit (and Phil, I believe, even described Brad as being broken). But, so much Matt! I know I'm horrible, really. But I enjoy seeing my favorite cyclist on national TV.  The word of the day is  not  Lance (okay -- it is OLN-wise, but not me-wise), but instead, it's ""ouch."" Tyler, Mario, Bernhard and others. All the different peloton breaks were really interesting to watch. Granted, though, at the end there were only two: the main peloton and Brad and Matt. This is the first time I've seen a tour from the beginning. Before last year, I'd only watched highlights. And then, last year, I started watching on Stage 12.  I do have some complaints about OLN's coverage. With tennis, even ESPN can tell you all the completed matches. But OLN? Apparently they find no need to tell me where all the riders are after each stage. The only way I knew Matt was 181st was because they showed a little (two lines) summary of him while he was helping Brad. Although I know that Matt is probably 187th of 188. And, sadly, Brad is 188th (EDIT: I learned when I finally got home, that Matt was actually 186th and Brad 187th, because poor Nick Gates didn't make the cut.)  Although my TV watching has been split between the Wimbledon finals (Gah. Roger. I wanted Andy to win) and the stage, I fully enjoyed and appreciated the rain-filled racing.   Also, if Al complains one more time about the lack of Lance coverage, I'm going to write an email (EDIT: Oddly enough, he never did). I wish they would show a little more respect for the other 187 riders.   Enough complaining. I truly enjoyed the final sprint. I must admit that I kind of expected Petacchi to win, but it was almost clear that the Fassa Bortolo train was not completely in control and thus didn't allow enough of a leadout for Petacchi.

114,"Disclaimer: not really a disclaimer lol, but just a few passing comments which to let you know what I'm saying now is not incuded in the article. This is pretty esoteric i might add, not really THAT esoteric as I'm not talking about the origins of the phrygian and its applications, or stuff along that line. But if you're not musically-inclined or do not play an instrument, then this won't be of interest to you, yep.   If you think that tabbing, especially tabbing solos are for people with perfect pitch like Mozart, well, tabbing is not that difficult, it is if you try to figure out every single note without a proper guideline. But, tabbing songs out yourself brings about great benefits, not only if you have a song which you can’t find any tabs for, but it also helps you grow as a musician. By tabbing solos out yourself, you get a better knowledge of scales and how solos are constructed, and it helps in developing pitch recognition…….who knows? Mozart might be transcribing what his sister played in their living room way before he was discovered at 5.  Well, here is a step-by-step guide to tabbing solos.    1. Break it down.   Breaking it down helps you to identify the different musical and beat patterns in the solo. It is really the simplest thing you can do, but also the most important.    2. Sing it out    Before the solos gets to your fingers, it has to get to your mouth. Sing out the solo and make sure it is in perfect pitch. Sing a B when the note playing is a B. Try singing the solo out, it works wonders.    3. Identify the key.    If you have a fairly musical ear, this should not be a problem for you. But if not, there are a few ways which you can do it. Firstly, identify the first note in the solo. If this cannot be done, then look at the intro of the song. What is the first note/chord being played?   Try using 5th chords on your guitar because 5ths possesses neither minor nor major characteristics. Try an E powerchord, followed by an F etc. until you find the chord with suits the pitch of the first note/chord. Never mind if the song has a d minor but you played a D5, you have just found out that the song is in the key of D, and that’s what we need to know……for now.    4. Identify the scale    Before you can identify the scale, you have to take the root note, and do a hit-and-run (i.e. transcribe by ear) at the first 3 to 4 different notes in the solo.  The second step to identify the scale is to make a logical guess. If you have a fairly good knowledge of scales, such a logical guess would not be too big a problem. If possible, identify it just be hearing the solo. But if not, here is how to take the first step to make a logical guess. Firstly, identify the genre, if it is hard rock, mixolydian or the minor pentatonic would be your usual suspects etc.   One tip: Pentatonic scales do not have any semitones unless chromatic passing tones are added to them. So, if there are no semitones in the first 4-5 notes you have figured out, you’re most probably in pentatonic territory, but don’t be too sure at this point.   Secondly, write down the first 3-4 different notes which you have figured out by ear. If you do not have a solid knowledge of scales, get to a website or a programme with a comprehensive list of scales which you can view from. See which scale contains the first 3-4 notes which you have found. If you have a few different scales which share the same 3-4 notes you have found, figure out by ear again 1 or 2 more different notes to narrow it down to only 1 possibility.  This can be the most easiest or the most difficult part depending on the solo and the scale/s used.    5. Write down the individual notes    I generally would not recommend the notes be written in tab, but rather in their names. Like B flat as Bb, instead of the 6th fret on the first string. Use the scale as a guide as to which notes you are “allowed” to use. Start with the root note and sing the pitch of the next note. Navigate till you find the next note. It should not pose too much of a problem if you have identified the scale and are able to sing the next note out.  Never mind, if the actual solo plays the B flat at the 3rd fret on the 3rd string and you started at the first string 6th fret, it is immaterial for now, what matters is that you get the different notes right.  This process could take you a bit of patience; the key is not to lose the pitch as you sing the note which you want to figure out next. Never mind the hammer-ons, pull-offs or bends for now.    6. Use a keyboard/piano    It is amazing how a keyboard or piano can make tabbing out your solos easier. Here are a few advantages.   a.There are no repeat notes, all notes are distinct.   The fact that a keyboard has no repeat notes keep you in focus and won’t make the whole musical landscape seem so vast and complex, you only have to worry about 7 notes (depending on the scale) right now, ignoring the octaves, for now.   b.All accidentals are laid out nicely    Scales are much easier to see and learn, and the lesser possibility of you hitting a note outside of the scale you found out. Hitting a wrong note could very well disorientate your musical senses for a while.   Try using the piano, it works wonders. Figuring out a portion of that Dream Theater solo is no different from figuring out twinkle twinkle little star by ear if done on a piano.    7. Identify octaves    When you have figured out all the individual notes, never mind that it sounds like three blind mice now, its time to figure out which octaves the notes belong to. Remember I said not to worry if the note you figured out is not of the correct octave? Now its time to take that into consideration, you can put aside the piano for a while, every string on the guitar has different timbral qualities when being hit at different frets, so the guitar is now much more suited for this job.  Play all the root notes of the scale in your guitar at all different positions, just the root note. Then, play the first 5-6 notes starting from each different root notes and tweak your ears to find out which octave the root note belongs to.  A process of “substitution” can take place here. Because say, an E can be played on the 12th fret first string but the same E on the same octave can be done on the 17th fret on the 2nd string. What’s most important here, after figuring out which octave it belongs, is simply to find the position which is most comfortable to you.  Remember that as you do this, write down the “raw tab” as I call it, of the different notes in tab, without adding the hammer-ons , pull-offs, the slides etc.    8. Identify techniques    Now it is time to add the harmonics, the slides etc. into the song. Anyone who has some experience on guitar would be able to tell the difference between a slide and hammer-on and know when there is a bend or vibrato. This process is fairly simple. Just add the techniques into the “raw tab” which you just wrote. Say you wrote a C then it goes up to an Eb, and there is a bend to get from the C to Eb in the solo, just simply notate a 3 fret bend on the tab.  When the techniques are all added into the “raw tab”, you can re-write it and voila! You have just successfully tabbed your first solo.   I hope that this guide would be a great help to you. Even though it takes a great deal of patience even with this guide in hand, but I hope that it won’t make tabbing such an impossible task. If you’re thinking “what for?” well, tabbing, like I said, helps develop your musical ear and gives you a greater understanding of scales and how solos are constructed.  Cheers…..and happy tabbing……",16,male

116,"urlLink The Organization for Security  Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)  has been invited by the State Department to send an observation mission for the Nov. 2 election in the US.  It's tempting to see this as a cave in to pressure from D's in Congress.  Think again.  The State Dept. jumped at this because it isn't a threat.   Anyone who has participated in any OSCE election observation mission (I've been on three) knows that the verdict of the mission will be written by OSCE member state ambassadors, who have political agendas to grind.   Guess who is the most important member state of the OSCE - the US.  Guess who appoints the ambassador to the OSCE - GW Bush.  In January, I wrote a piece for the  urlLink London Sunday Times  on the impending OSCE election observation mission in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia, warning of a whitewash (which happened.)  It's a good primer on the OSCE's internal processes.  I pasted it here (you can't get it online unless you subscribe to the Sunday Times.)   Georgia vs. the election observers.   By Tim Russo       ""You're joking,"" my British friend whispered to me as he came to a stop after racing into the building with urgency.    We stood at the back of an old auditorium, packed with international press, government officials, embassy staff, and observers of the 1998 presidential election in Armenia.  The head of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) international observation mission sat at a table in the front, calmly reading the delegation's preliminary statement on the conduct of the election the previous day.  I looked down at the ground in stunned silence.  ""I just got back from my count,"" my friend said in disbelief.    ""Have you even showered?"" I asked.  ""Haven't showered in a day and a half,"" he said.  ""We went to the OSCE office, they told us to come here,"" he said.  ""I just got out of the car after an eight hour drive,"" he finished, panting.   I feared what was coming.  He'd just been an observer at a late night vote count in a remote, mountainous border region where military manipulation of the election was expected, and turned out to be particularly egregious.  ""Where do I take these?"" he said waving a stack of notes and documents in the air, his voice now frustrated.  I just looked at him and shook my head, having spent the previous night at an equally farcical vote count myself until 9 a.m. that morning.  He started looking around for someone in charge.  ""What is going on here?  Why is the statement being issued, I haven't even reported from my assignment?""  I just rubbed my forehead as my friend kept charging about the back of the room with his documents, his desperation telling it all about how the election must have gone where he'd observed it.  Then we heard from the podium, ""...a step forward for democracy...""    My friend lost it.  He stopped in his tracks.  I walked over to try and calm him down, but he just looked at me in shock, shoving my outstretched arm away.  ""What a fucking joke...,"" he said with one last wave of his notes, then he threw them to the floor angrily, turned around, and marched out of the building in disgust, as the head of the delegation calmly continued reading his verdict of approval.  Since the soviet collapse, it seems every new election in the post soviet republics deteriorates into more of a sham than the one before it, 2003 proving a banner year for post soviet electoral fraud.  This year, the OSCE, post soviet international election observers of record, condemned various elections in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and even Russia, whose December 7 parliamentary election it described in its preliminary statement as `overwhelmingly distorted'.   The people of Georgia, however, finally refused to accept yet another fraudulent election.  Helped along by the condemnation of election observers (OSCE as well as domestic observers), the people power in the streets of Tbilisi in November forced out the president, Edward Shevardnadze.  Enough had become enough, and now there is great hope for a new era in Georgia of elections free of manipulation, beginning with the presidential election January 4.  As my British friend would agree, Georgia need look no further than its rugged southern border for guidance in the days ahead.  In 1998, Armenia faced very similar circumstances.  A president who relied on electoral fraud to stay in power was forced to resign.  A new election was scheduled, the OSCE descended en masse to observe.  And a similar hope for a future of free and fair elections was in the air.  But Georgians should watch the OSCE as carefully as they watch their election processes, for the OSCE's recent boldness in the aftermath of this year's many sham elections is very recent indeed.    Run by member states, OSCE observation missions exist in a diplomatic no mans land; on the one hand dedicated to promote integrity in the democratic process, but on the other, representing the political and economic policy interests of the member states.  The result is that far from being disinterested guarantors of democratic integrity, OSCE election observation missions, and especially the statements they make in the immediate aftermath of an election, are not unblinking verdicts by a referee, but more often are delicate balancing acts of high diplomacy.  It is a balance the OSCE has often gotten exactly wrong at precisely the wrong moment.  As the new democracies of the former Soviet Union were finding their feet, and member states of the OSCE were assessing the new geopolitical realities, OSCE election observation missions found ever more creative ways to gloss over the ever more fraudulent elections.  Whatever the competing interest, the commitment to helping these new democracies create fair electoral processes regularly took a back seat, with the perverse result that messy elections were not only ignored, but made even messier by the OSCE and the increasing caricature of their increasingly predictable whitewashes.    Armenia's presidential election in 1998 was a prime example.  As an observer within the OSCE mission at the time, I had a front row seat to not only observe the pervasive electoral fraud, but also the OSCE's delicate balancing act between the compelling observations the observers kept reporting, and the member states' interest in ignoring them.   The resulting OSCE verdict, a masterfully acrobatic navigation of statements and reports that managed the least amount of honesty when it was most needed, rubber stamped an election widely described by experienced observer delegates at the time as perhaps the most sophisticated electoral fraud they'd ever witnessed.    The timing of the OSCE's abdication of its responsibility in Armenia in 1998 could not have been worse.  After years of preceding electoral manipulation, as a chance arose for democracy to change the course of a troubled country, the OSCE hailed a thorough fraud as a `step forward' for democracy, writing off the blatant joke of precincts reporting 300% turnout as not causing them `to question the result'.  The result in the years since has been the rapidly accelerating rot of Armenia's democracy.  The OSCE should be applauded for its honesty in 2003, but perhaps with a slow hand clap rather than a standing ovation.  Its talk this year is quite cheap.  For when it mattered most, when a credible international organization's verdict on the conduct of an election could have affected democratic processes for the better, the OSCE too often has blinked.  Elections in Armenia, Russia, Georgia, or the other former soviet republics, did not suddenly become `overwhelmingly distorted' overnight and in secret; they've been deteriorating predictably and in full view for more than a decade.  The OSCE's sudden, too little, and far too late honesty about electoral processes which are rotten to the core -  processes the OSCE itself has had a hand in perpetuating - might actually be comic if it weren't so tragic.  Georgia in 2004 may be different.  The OSCE did have an effect on the November election.  And if they are willing and able to stay as honest about the next one, Georgia may finally find the courage to not only refuse their legacy of electoral fraud, but work to eradicate it.It is likely, however, that the OSCE balancing act is in full swing already.  The likely next president, Mikhail Saakashvilli, is a friendly protégé of the OSCE member states.  He will likely win in a landslide, whether or not there is any fraud, and the OSCE will want nothing to taint his victory.  Clean reporting of electoral manipulation may already be taking a back seat to the rise of a friendly new ally in a difficult and unstable region.  Fraud there will certainly be.  It is tempting to think that the people power in Georgia that refused the latest fraud can herald a new interest in fair and clean processes, that somehow the disappearance of a corrupt figurehead will result in the disappearance of the deep rooted structure of electoral manipulation that kept him there.    But the practices of looking the other way while a ballot box is stuffed, or taking advantage of miserably inaccurate voter lists, forging a signature here or a vote total there, bribing or blackmailing voters with meager amounts of money that are many times their monthly salaries, have a way of sticking around and metastasizing into a permanent cancer if ignored for too long.  The OSCE will then have a choice between issuing a statement, the first draft of which is likely already written, that reports what actually happens, or one that will predictably refer to these practices as not having `affected the outcome', that despite these shortcomings, the result will have `reflected the will of the people'.  It is a crucial moment for the OSCE, an organization that appears to be attempting to rehabilitate its credibility.  Perhaps the OSCE will finally get the timing right.  For Georgia, though, much more is at stake than institutional credibility.  It will soon have a new president who will likely bring hope for a new future.  Whether or not his election will herald a new, freer democracy, is an open question.",36,male
117,"I get to the end of my day and ask myself if I hit the PO!NT. It’s a brief time of reflection where I go over the days events and try to identify where my PO!NT met up with reality. I think today was a so-so day. I can see where I was onPO!NT, but I wasn’t in the game 100%. Tomorrow is a new day.  On another note; I think there has been some confusion about the title of my blog. I can clearly see why and where the confusion takes place. Most of you know that I run a growing marketing company called onPO!NT Media Group. O.K., Ameliou really runs it, I just add my 2 cents in on occasion.  Here is a little background.   OPMG came about as we were trying to identify a name for our new venture. If you have known me for a while, you may have heard me mention keeping an onPO!NT life. An onPO!NT life is a life lived with a PO!NT. It’s living with a purpose. It’s having your purpose written down and in front of you on a daily basis. Ameliou says it best: “If you’re not living onPO!NT, you are living with no point.” We used that correlation with our marketing company. We focus on finding and communicating the point you are trying to make. Why? Because if your marketing isn’t onPO!NT, it has no point.  Moving right along. My blog, as you can see, is hosted at OPMG. However, it’s meant to be a reflection of what my PO!NT is, and not a commentary on the happenings of OPMG. See how they are connected but not really?  I know… it’s confusing.

119,"Critics. Critics are the biggest group of snobs that I know. Why? Because they try to act like their opinions are unbiased and they simply are not. I can cite two specific examples: My Life by Bill Clinton and Fahrenheit 9/11. I want to state that I have my own political views and what I speak has not-so-much to do with party ties. I do not believe in the two party political system, which I am sure I will rant on about at another time. It has to deal with the fact that individuals use their own political beliefs to dictate whether or not something is 'good' or not.   Over and over on the news, on the web, and in newspapers I have had to hear how horrible Bill Clinton's book, My Life, is. Of course I had to go pick up my own copy and discover for myself. The book is not horrible. The book is not boring. The book is not a self-promoting tool thought up by Mr. Clinton himself.   The book goes through his life, which is perhaps why it is called MY LIFE, and documents important moments of his life. Some critics have said that they were disappointed by how little about Monica Lewinsky was in that book. I hate to disappoint people, especially those that are party whores and use their party ideology to justify every single belief that they have, or as I like to call them, Ba Ba Sheep, but Monica Lewinsky was not all of Clinton's life. He had a life before and a life after Monica. And there are over 15 pages devoted to Monica. Don't believe me? Go to your closest bookstore, look in the index and count them for yourself.   Most of the critics went into this book with preconceived notions on what it should be about, what tales should be written, and how the story should have unfolded. Sorry jerkies, this was HIS book, not yours.   Other idiots, like a few talk radio show hosts and cable news show personalities criticized the book on the first day that it came out, after admittedly only receiving a copy of the book that day. Hate to break it to you, but they did not read all 900 + pages of that book. They decided to thumb through it and base their biased, republican bought butts on a few chapters. Again, more jerkies.   Now let's move on to the Michael Moore film. I went and saw it because I was asked to write an unbiased review on the movie for publication. The movie was ok. Got people thinking. Wasn't lacking Michael Moore's dry humor during the commentary or his in-your-face-style. Wasn't his best work. I leave his best work to Roger and Me. But it was ok.    Now the backlash begins for Michael Moore, having to back up every statement that has been made, which if you are going to present a movie with a topic as serious as this, you better be prepared to. Do people, and by people I mean individuals paid to write about this movie, blindly miss the fact that this movie is going to be based upon his own opinions and will most definitely be biased towards that? Michael Moore has never apologized for himself or what he believes in. Why should this movie be any different.   And then there are idiots like Christopher Hitchens who debunk the movie. If anyone has read his column, it is more than obvious to anyone with two brain cells in their head working in harmony that this guy clearly does not like Michael Moore. And, while he is trying to debunk and prove with 'fact' the inaccuracies of Michael Moore in Fahrenheit 9/11 (which the 9/11 Commission, if being facutal in their reports, have already proven) he gets a few of these 'facts' he states wrong. Like that Iraq was the only country in that region celebrating what happened on that horrible day in September, almost three years ago. Iran, in fact, celebrated as well. Among others. His ranting and raving about Michael Moore is the same ranting and raving that republicans have done on websites like freerepublic.com or in various message boards and political chats. I am sure that I could find a transcript of Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh saying the same things that Christopher Hitchens did in his article.   What happened to unbiased reporting and truth in journalism? Now everyone has a vendetta or parties in their pockets, making them nothing more than literary whores. Cheap whores at that! And those literary whores do a great disservice to the writing community.",27,female
120,"On Friday the Senate passed the PIRATE Act, using a speedy method for passage usually reserved from noncontroversial bills.  The House still must vote on the PIRATE Act in order for it to become law.  The Senate Judiciary Committee is responsible for coming up with these laws.  Congress is attempting to pass the PIRATE Act in a quick and stealthy fashion, similar to how the the Judiciary Committee is attempting to get the INDUCE Act passed.  These are both very controversial bills and not a single hearing has been held for either of them.  A reason, one suspects, is because the senior members of the Judiciary committe get lots of donations from the entertainment industry: so far in 2004, Patrick Leahy has received $178,000 in campaign contributions from the entertainment industries, that's the second-biggest source of donations to Leahy behind lawyers.  Orrin Hatch has received $152,360.  These guys have definatly gone out for drinks with Jack Valenti after work.  To actually debate these bills would bring to light the Bill's many problems.  The RIAA and MPAA just want them passed, and quickly, before any press and critics get a say.   Foes of the Pirate Act have been alarmed by the unusual alacrity of the proposal's legislative progress. It was introduced just two months ago, on March 25, and not one hearing was held before the Judiciary committee forwarded it to the full Senate for a vote a month later.   For instance, the main change the PIRATE Act will make to US law is that it will allow the Gov't to go after file sharers in a similar fashion to the way the RIAA has been suing them by the hundreds, in civil suits.  Typically the Gov't, when going after criminals, file criminal charges against them.  Obviously their priorities are other than to prosecute teenage file sharers, considering the concern with such other criminal acts as murder, rape, terrorism, etc.  Believe it or not, the Justice Dept does have limited (taxpayer) resources and must pick it's priorities.   The Pirate Act represents the latest legislative priority for the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and its allies, who collectively argue that dramatic action is necessary to prevent file-swapping networks from continuing to blossom in popularity.   They don't want any hearings because there would be some difficule and embarrassing questions:   ""I can't imagine that (Hollywood lobbyist) Jack Valenti or (RIAA chairman) Mitch Bainwol really wants to come before Congress and give testimony saying, 'We can't afford to bring these lawsuits. That's why we want the taxpayer to pay for them.' I can't believe they want to do that in public.""   Bonus for the entertainment industry, they get to use wiretaps now!   [T]he Justice Department likely would be able to seek wiretaps to collect evidence about P2P infringement. Current wiretap law says electronic communications may be intercepted when a potential federal felony is being investigated.   A basic problem with the PIRATE Act is that it forces the Justice Dept. to do the RIAAs job for it, using taxpayer money.  Should the Justice Dept spend a couple million bucks next year suing file sharers?  Sounds like a waste to me when the RIAA is doing a fine job already.  Also, if the INDUCE Act passes there will be no need to sue file sharers anyway, because there will no longer be any P2P networks or iPods around.   ""It represents yet another point in another very long line of major corporate copyright interests pushing for and receiving what amounts to significant corporate welfare,"" said Adam Eisgrau, a lobbyist for the P2P United trade association. ""This legislation literally offloads the cost of enforcing copyrights traditionally borne by the copyright holder onto the federal government and therefore the taxpayers.""

The car ride was pretty boring. It was boring in the sense that I was two-dimensional.  Jing’s cousin Madel was a med student and Mel, of course, is a nurse so they had plenty to talk about, along with Madel’s classmate Jera who tagged along.  Jing and Raisa (who drove the car) talked about boyfriends and this Aga-Kristine chick flick “It Might Be You” (or was it “All My Life”? I don’t really give a shit), something a loveless bisexual like me cannot relate to.

I began to be bored again during intermission and was seriously contemplating going to Gweilos.  I texted Mario, the bar owner and Gweilos Hour host but he didn’t text back.  He was probably busy entertaining call center kids on a Thursday night.  I was also thinking of getting picked up. Too bad my black  “hot chick”  top failed to do the trick.  No one really gets picked up from a group; at least, that’s how I understand how the whole “picking up” thing works.  I don’t really go out much, sowee. But there were lots of beautiful people, I felt really sorry for myself that I wasn’t cute enough or that next to the med students I looked either fat or geeky (still don’t use contact lenses yet, can’t afford it) or old.  “Nope, I will not get laid tonight, poor me” , that’s how bored I felt.

Nice to see that what is, in my opinion, such a poorly written book could manage to launch his entire body of work into the public eye and make that man rich, rich, rich. My sarcasm is, of course, intended.   A friend of mine noted that the entire beginning of the aforementioned book really functions as a giant ad for ""prequel""  Angels and Demons . Anyone who loved his protagonist that much ought to save themselves a lot of time and go rent ""Raiders of the Lost Ark.""  At any rate, again, there are bright spots on the list -- page down past #20 and you'll find my previous recommendations,  Life of Pi  and  Middlesex . It's good to know but also interesting to note that those books are carried in bookstores with a limited selection of titles, like Books-A-Million. Maybe distribution -- and the sign proclaiming ""Summer Reading"" -- is everything; God knows it's a lot. It's still heartening to see, but on a recent cheapskate trip to Books-A-Million, as opposed to local dealer Olssen's or ubiquitous but satisfying Borders or Barnes  Noble, I couldn't find Eugenides' previous book,  Virgin Suicides , on the shelves. I would imagine tons of Dan Brown would have been easy to find of course.  Another bright spot? Tolstoy's classic,  Anna Karenina , has found its way back onto the bestseller lists. Go Leo! That's pretty awesome. Actually, thank you Oprah, for that one.  So anyway, getting great reading into people's hands may be as easy as distribution and information -- prime real estate in Books-A-Million or a plug from Oprah. (One day, maybe, the Internet will help as well, of course, but so far it seems the masses are still mostly downloading tunes or reading news, as opposed to frequenting lit mags.) Literary magazines in a store like BAM? Nor hardly. Scan those shelves and the closest you get is  The Atlantic  and  The New Yorker .   Nobody ever said being a writer -- and actually getting read -- is easy, that's for sure.  Thanks for reading,  LadyLitBlitzin",34,female

130,"Whew. Where to begin? I loved New York, but I am glad to be home.   Wednesday  We really just walked and walked and walked. Through Times Square and the theater district. The lights of Times Square are amazing. Breathtaking. Shocking. Had dinner at the Java Shop, where I saw Chris Noth, a.k.a. Mr. Big from Sex in the City.   Thursday  Had breakfast at a deli before staking out our standing spot for the Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade. We ended up across from the Ed Sullivan Theater, home of the David Letterman Show. I loved the parade. The balloons and celebrities  just awesome! Had lunch at our hotel. A nice buffet, although their definition of traditional Thanksgiving dessert and mine were totally different. Bring on pumpkin pie. Pecan pie. Not flan or pink mousse!! That afternoon we walked over to Radio City Music Hall (we could see the marquee from our 42nd floor hotel room.) Wandered around Rockefeller Center. Watched the skaters, window shopped. Not much was open, but there were lots of people. Really enjoyed the Rockettes Christmas Spectacular. Walked down 5th avenue and wandered our way back to the hotel.   Friday  Hit the Today Show at 7 a.m.  Us and hundreds of others. They had already closed the tourist area, so we went into Dean and Deluca for a bagel  coffee. Can I just mention how awesome a real bagel is? Andres Bocelli was the Today Show featured singer, so we wandered out to hear him sing. Just as we did, they opened up a new section behind the stage, so we got in and eventually got right up to the stanchion (those around us werent interested in an opera singer). He gave me goosebumps. The camera man was right in our section and mom and I were on TV!!  Matt Lauer came around and shook hands with mom and I (o.k., o.k., and lots of other people too). Then Al Roker came by and I conversed with him about a recent Thanksgiving special he had on the Food Network. He stood near me and talked directly to me for a minute or so. Even so, I felt Matt was more personable and sincere (o.k., and better looking too). Katie was off.  We had a hop-on, hop-off tour with Grayline, so we caught the bus up to Central Park.  The leaves had just turned and were stunning. We just dont get ""color"" in Texas. Worked our way up to Strawberry Fields and the Imagine memorial. Sat for a while and just enjoyed the view. Then over to the Dakota (a pilgrimage for Linda) and back to Tavern on the Green for lunch. The food was really good and I see why the place is a popular tourist stop, but I must concede the chandeliers, wallpaper and other stuff border on gaudy.  After lunch we visited the Rose Planetarium. It was Lindas primary destination (next to the Lennon pilgrimage). It didnt do much for me since it is based on the Big Bang theory and I dont believe that is how the universe was created. Perhaps I should have been able to separate my beliefs and enjoyed the place, but I couldnt. We grabbed a quick snack before attempting a Night Lights Tour. Grayline underestimated the response and didnt have enough buses. Luckily we could come back, but many others couldnt. The crowd moved as close to a riot as I have ever seen.   Saturday  After breakfast, we hopped on the bus to Macys. We mostly browsed, but we each made it home with something from the Worlds Largest Store. The morning started foggy and drizzly, but cleared up by the time we left the store. Back on the tour bus to Soho, Greenwich Village, Canal Street, Chinatown before lunching at Taormina in Little Italy. Then to Battery Park and the Staten Island Ferry. I really wanted to see the Statue of Liberty, but it is closed, so the ferry is the closest you can get. I think I sang (softly of course) God Bless America and America the Beautiful the entire ride.  Finished up the day with the Night Light Tour. There are lots of lights in NYC. And not just in Times Square. I really enjoyed seeing the buildings lit up at night (from the top of a double decker bus  its really a nice perspective).    Sunday  After my Krispie Kreme donut, it was off to the uptown tour past Central Park and into Harlem. I must commend the tour guides. They were interesting, entertaining and very knowledgeable. Mom wanted to hit Rockefeller Center on last time, so we did that before lunch at Stage Deli (yummy!), where we saw Jerry Springer (oooh, ahhhh  whatever.)  Unfortunately the shuttle service insisted we get to the airport way too early. I know we could have fit another something or two into the day. The flights were bumpy and we were stuck at OHare for four hours. It was 2 a.m. when I got home. But we got home safe and sound.   So, beyond the play-by-play:   I wont travel with Linda and my mom again. Linda wanted to go like great guns and mom cant. I felt bad for her. She cried last night when I dropped her off because she felt like her slowness held us back. I never want her to feel that way. I want her to go and have fun and not worry about others. Her hip hurt a lot from the walking. I could see that she was struggling, but when I would ask it was always, Im fine.  I always forget between trips that Linda snores. I spent a lot of this trip very, very tired. I am not accustomed to sleeping with someone (not even my mom). Couple that with snoring and it was really hard on me. One morning I woke up crying I was so tired.  Me being tired doesnt make for a happy camper, which can make for tense moments. I need my eight hours!  Our hotel was in a prime location. I would recommend it. That and the tours. You can only read so much and pick up so many brochures. The tours were the perfect compliment to the trip.  The weather was awesome. Excluding the one morning, it was sunny and clear each day. Sunday it was even warm enough to forgo my jacket. It was really, really nice. The only time I felt cold was at the parade. My feet felt frozen solid, but it was worth it. Truly, we could not have ordered better weather.  The service was about what you expect it to be. Indifferent. Sometimes outright rude. The tourists were really nice (an amazing number from Texas  every day we met someone from the Lone Star state). I guess beyond waiters and sales clerks, we didn't have much interaction with many locals ... and that's too bad. I would have liked more. It's the reporter in me.   And finally.   We chose not to visit Ground Zero. While it seemed an important destination for most every tourist we spoke with, none of us wanted to see it. But you do. In the faces of the passers-by. At the fire stations (ladder houses). The memorials and pictures and flags are everywhere. It is on the news every day. In the stories of the tour guides. You can smell it in the air. We saw bits of the building remains from a distance. I dont think you need to see Ground Zero to feel it.  I'm glad we went. I will definitely go back some day. But I am glad to be home.

131,"Thanksgiving was excellent and hardly marred at all by the ungodly carrolling of the penguins.  I threw a boot at two of them and made eye contact with Charles- he seemed to be somewhat embarrassed by the behavior of his new friends, but did not make any other moves to re-establish contact.  We ate oatmeal and brie and listened to  urlLink Alice's Restaurant  on the shortwave, as we have done every year for the past 200 years.  Then we danced.

132,"Today I heard a  rumor. Danielle Barber, the wife of a soldier station with Jesse, informed me that her husband was told that he, and a few other soldiers, were possibly going to be deployed earlier than the rest of the pack. When I told Jesse about this he said he hadn't heard anything about this but that there were tons of rumors going around right now. This could be good news if they get to come home 3 weeks earlier then the rest, however it could also be bad news as well. Danielle and I were planning to fly to Texas in March to spend a few days with our husbands and in fact I had even spend the day with her on Sunday, buying a few new clothes to wear for our trip, and a few lacey items as well. I know I shouldn't get my hopes up for anything involving this whole ordeal but the fact of the matter is that hope is all I really have. I hope that David (Danielle's husband), Jesse and the rest of those who might have to go early, don't have to leave without the rest of the unit, and that they all leave at the same time. I want to fly to Texas to see Jesse, I feel like it is something I need to do.   I feel like the ARMY is taking more then they give.",24,female

134,"Guys tell: What matters most   By Matthew Sakey        For all their similarities, guys also display great variance. As satisfying as it would be to cynically insist that every man on earth is interested only in willingness to copulate, bust size, leg length and sympathy to scheduling issues during football season (in that order), it's not a fair judgment. Many qualities guys look for are intangible, so if you're in the market, be advised that most men value these features above all others.   1. Tolerance This is often interpreted as ""sympathy to scheduling issues during football season,"" but it's really much broader than that. Guys like what they like â whatever that may be, and it will certainly differ from guy to guy â and though they might make an effort to respect your feelings about their pastimes and viewpoints, they're not likely to change them for you. Guys want to be with women who don't roll their eyes when they head out to play D or insist that a visit to the shoe store is more important than hockey playoffs. Respect their idiosyncrasies and they'll respect yours.   2. Compatibility with friends His friends aren't necessarily going to become your friends, but you need to be able to stand their presence. In fact, it would help if you like them a little, always remembering that they are his friends, so a certain boundary needs to be respected. There will be times when he wants to be with them rather than you, and if you like them it'll help clarify why. Similarly, a guy's friends and his relationship do not fill the same section of his heart: he needs both, and prefers when they fit together comfortably.   3. Honesty and decency Men don't like being cheated on or lied to any more than women do. If you're a chew 'em up and spit 'em out type, your life will be a string of one-night stands followed by a bitter spinsterhood. You man must feel he can trust you without question, and it is your behavior that will ensure he does.   4. Independence This is a tricky one, and it doesn't apply to every man in the wild, but there's a good chance he prefers to be with someone who can own and operate their daily lives. The complaint that he needs his ""space"" when a relationship sours is actually an indication that he feels constricted by your failure to manage your own affairs and respect his occasional need for privacy. You made it to adulthood without him; surely you can continue being self-sufficient now.   5. Comprehension of differences Men, being from Mars, think before they feel. When men discuss problems, they do not commiserate, they offer solutions. This creates a huge communication gap in relationships, because a woman wants emotional support while the guy uncomprehendingly suggests a resolution. Neither side is right or wrong, but women are hard wired to be feelers and men are hard wired to be thinkers. Understanding that he is not being callous or short when he tells you what he thinks rather than what he feels will score you lots of points.   Men are complicated beasts, and it's no wonder that women still struggle to figure out what motivates them. We're all people, but there are some fundamental differences, and equally fundamental misconceptions, in what each gender wants from the other. But men aren't the shallow goobers they're sometimes made out to be, and giving them the benefit of the doubt in this will mean lots of potential mates from which to choose.",26,female

136,"i need some damn sleep. i of course had to work last night in which i was unable to get any sleep. when i was supposed to get relieved by the other crew i had to wait because they had some formation and me and this other guy had to stay back. well when they finally finished and i got to leave i was tole i had to stay back and go with the duty driver on some stupid errands. by the time we got the srupid humvv and a damn radio it was about 0830. i got to my tent around 0835 and thought that maybe i could make it to breakfast even though it ened at nine. i went to the restroom and upon returning to my tent was told i had to be in the rec tent to clean up at 0845. so much for breakfst.  once that was done i had to go drive with the duty driver to pick up the laundry and mail. that wasnt exactly a short drive. it took forever and boy was the ride bumpy. i got to see the lake though. wow from the distance i saw it at and from what little i saw it was nice. i got to look at the scnerey which consisted of you guessed it....sand. then we go to get the mail only to have to get a slap in the face since no one had a mail card. why didn't i think of that. by the time we unloaded the laundry back at the tents and stuff it was about 1100. i took a shower and straightened up my little amount of space. by the time i was done i decided to lay down finally around 1220. i ended up having to get up around 1245 to get dressed for lunch since i told strasle i would and because well i hadn't eaten a damn thing. now i'm here and it's about 1430. i'm so tired but if i sleep now i won't sleep tonight. i get to be up by 0900 tomorrow or a fun-filled day of filling sandbags on of course my ""day off"". how lucky huh. at least i'm doing good and keeping safe i guess that's all that matters. other then that i think i'll take it easy today maybe go read another book. in the what almost 3 weeks i've been here i've managed to read 2 books. i'll have read a whole library by the time i leave this place. oh well it helps pass the time. everyone take care and god bless. get some sleep also. well for me at least since i can't seem to be able to at the moment.",23,female
137,"V.D.: DELAYED REACTION   Valentine's Day has left a bad taste in my mouth.  Frankly, I'm a bit ambivalent about it.  Great for you if you had someone to call your Valentine but for me, well, it seems I've always been in between boyfriends on February 14th.  Today, a handful of people greeted me with,  ""So!  How was your Valentine's Day?""   (These were folks who don't really know me well; otherwise they wouldn't have asked.)  I dunno, it wasn't too bad... I awoke on Saturday with a hangover (don't ask), went to a gay marriage rights rally, then to an eye doctor appointment, then home for a nap.  I hung out with my friends Woody  Todd that evening (I swear, my gay friends have better romantic relationships than I), then half-watched ""Saturday Night Live"" until I crashed at midnight.  Pretty exciting life I lead, no?  I will admit that things could be worse... I have a new job and I think I like it.  I can't believe that there are no ""red flags"".  I'm actually being treated like a professional and not being micro-managed by my new employers.  It's a small group, and everyone does their own thing, coming together to get things done and looking to others to provide assistance and their expertise when needed.  (I know that someone at my company is probably reading my Blog, so of course I have nothing but  great things  to say, heh heh!)  Additionally, I don't get the sense that there are any prima donnas there.  I'm the Office Manager, dammit, and I have an OFFICE.  With a DOOR!  Life doesn't get any better than that (when I dream, I dream BIG!)  There's even the possibility that I'll make a trip to our home office in Calgary (Alberta, Canada) in the near future, and the prospect of travel excites me.  I need a change of scenery and soon!!  Oh, regarding Saturday's rally,  urlLink Todd  posted a nice, long excerpt about the event  urlLink here .  I should mention that my blog is not, and never will be, a forum for political or religious debate.  I make it a point not to comment on issues I'm not completely informed about.  I will note, however, that everyone deserves equal rights.  I don't know if gay marriage will truly ever fly in our conservative nation but I firmly agree that gay couples in long-term relationships should be entitled to the same benefits that married, heterosexual couples are.  Todd's partner Woody was interviewed by our local NBC affiliate and stated that he would like the comfort of knowing that if anything should ever happen to him that Todd would be taken care of.  These two Boyz are dear friends of mine and I will always support them and their partnership.  They taken me under their wing during very difficult times and for that, they have my undying appreciation and respect.  It's been a rough journey for these two, and enlightening for me, getting to know them and seeing the dynamics of their relationship.  Particularly for dear Woody, who suffers Todd's running commentary on the decor of the sets of television shows that they watch (""Arrested Development"" on FOX:  ""Oh, I just  hate  that ugly lamp!""   BBC's ""Coupling"" on PBS:  ""Oh Woody, that's a  Miro lithograph  on the wall!""   The evening news on NBC:   ""Oh Woody, I don't like when Sharon Wright wears red... it's so unflattering with her skin tone!""",40,female

142,"Yeah, so it's been over a week since I updated, so here we go.  I've been on vacation all week and go back at 12:30am Tuesday morning.  After more talks with Artis last week, it's obvious things are not going to reinstate, and I think I'm learning to accept that.  Dan wants to, well, go out with me, but that's far too complicated, and I just don't think it's a smart choice to pursue that at all.  So, there I was, all single, not too worried about it, and then I started talking to my buddy Yumi, a guy who contacted me from Planetout.  For some reason, I was kinda hesitant to meet him... I have no idea why, but I was.  Eventually though, I forced myself to... I have to stop being so damned picky and just meet people, and I think meeting Yumi proved that to me.  What I found when I met him was a cute, sweet, goofy, fun guy.  I was actually quite struck by him, so I decided to meet him again.  So that's twice I drove 80 miles round-trip to see him, haha... I'm always the one driving, but I love my car anyway, so who cares.  Both times we had fun, walked around outside a bit, just hung out... ok, well last time we maybe did a teensy bit more than hang out, but yeah... at least it shows we're interested in each other in some way.  I just hope this isn't another one of those situations where someone makes out with me and then does a disappearing act... doesn't seem likely though as he's driving down to visit me tomorrow... can't wait!  It's not like I'm going ga-ga for him... I've done that enough times to know it doesn't do anyone any good, so I'm holding back a bit, yeah, but maybe this time it'll work.

144,"yesterday i got back from Camp Pike 'o4! omg it was sooooo fun! seriously everyone that went on Wilderness was a BLAST to be with and we all had such a good time! the ride to colorado was like 15 hours, and we all rode on the same bus. it was a long ride, but we always have fun just chillin. then the day we got to the camp, we got to stay in this cabin called ""jungfrau"", although none of us could figure out what that meant or who thought of calling a cabin that. and we discovered that there were a few mice in our cabin...not cool. but they were all downstairs, not where our beds were, so it was okay. then the next morning we go up early and went to Inspiration Point, which is this AMAZING spot that the whole camp climbs to, and we have our morning devotion. from Inspiration Point you cant see so many mountains, hills, trees, and the rest of camp. its simply gorgeous! then we headed out for our ""warm-up hike"" to St. Elmo's. (has anyone seen ""St. Elmo's Fire"", the movie, with demi moore? its so awesome!) St. Elmo's was a 6 mile hike, and we allfinishedsplendidly.then we went to pizza hut to getsome pizzzzzzza and then we played the tripping game, which was SO fun!then we headed to our campsight and pitched our tent, which SJ and i were experts at! and we slept there that night and met some boy scouts that said they were 16 when they OBVIOUSLY werent. the next morning we went white-water rafting for the whole day. that was seriously awesome! our raft guide's name was John Meyer, kinda like John Mayer, so we just called him John da Bomb. and there were rapids called ""the wall slammer"" and stuff like that. doesnt make you feel very confident, but thats okay, it was so fun! then. that night,we stayed at the same camp sight as the night before, and SJ gave pavey and courtney a ""present"" but i wont talk about that, you just had to be there. then the next morning we went to a bakery and got donuts, and spenser paid for me because my moneywas in the trailor (thanks spenser). then me, katy, catherine, SJ, and brittany went in search of a bathroom across the entire town of Buena Vista. finally we found one. and then we headed off to Mt. Massive with our HUGE @$$ backpacks on our backs. the hike was soooo long and it hurt everyones back SO much. when we got to our campsite in the middle of this gorgeous canyon like thing, we realized the hike was worth it. we were surrounded by peaks, and the canyon had these two lakes that was gorgeous, and FREEZING (according to the boys and katy, who all jumped in). we set up camp that night, and ate some chicken and rice (yum). the next day was the most strenuous, scary thing ive ever done...but i did it. we all did it. that day we summited Mt. Massive (the second tallest mt in colorado) by making our own trail up this almost 90 degree angled ridge. it was so slippery and hard, but when we got to the top it was gorgeous! then after we got to the top of the ridge, we summited the peak. then we made ANOTHER trail down...but this time we slid on our butts in SNOW most of the way down. our hands were freezing, our butts were wet, and someboys were bleeding from helping catch the girls when we got to the end of the snow patches and couldnt slow down...but we made it back down to camp with just a few minor injuries. we slept again that night in the tents, and woke up the next morning at like 9to spenser playing the guitar, which was nice. then we made our way back down the mountain with our huge packs on our backs. it went much faster than onthe way up. we got down and then went to K's for lunch, which was verrrrry good. and then we went to this resale shop to buy our clothes for the dance that night. i got this weird skirt that was all colors and had weird patterns, and this yellow shirt that had little bows on it that looked like baloons. then we got back to camp and FINALLY took showers...which felt SO good, you have no idea. and then we headed back to the chapel for our skits. everyones was boring, except ours, of course, rocked. then we got the dance started and it was so much fun! i danced with this little boy during a slow dance because John Bryan asked me to because the little guy was shy and wouldnt ask a girl to dance with him. it was fun. and then the dance ended and we went back to the lodge and since wilderness didnt get dinner, we made ourselves some PBJ's and hot chocolate. we got our packages that our parents sent us then, and mi madre sent me some chips, doritoes, queso, skittles, and PEACHIE O'S (spenser theyre allllllMINE)!!! then we went back to sleep (after everyone kept trying to kill all the little mice that were in our rooms...what did the mice ever do to us???? nothing! we shouldve just sent them outside). we went to inspiration point again, the next morning, and that was sweet. and then we went down for breakfast in the dining hall and then we packed and watched all the little kids get awards for climbing Pike's Peak, when wilderness didnt get ANYTHING for climbing the hardest thing EVER!! (jk im not bitter) then we took pictures of our whole group, and i know theyre gonna turn out great! then we finally headed back home on our huge buses, i slept alot, talked, read, and watched happy gilmore and bruce almighty.finally when we got back to church, i talked to lindsay chinn for a while and then mi padre took me and michael to get DONUTS! woot woot! then i got home, showered, and slept the rest of the day! PIKE WAS AWESOME!!! I LOVE YOU GUYS! COUNSELORS NEXT YEAR BABY!!",16,female
145,"The night was just coming to life highlighting a moon crescent that was perfectly incomplete. There she was alone, standing on the edge of the shore, holding on to a half empty bottle of beer like it was a prop. She could hear the waves crashing in and out on the water while a myriad of diamonds bounce off foamy waves, sparkling in the moon glow for a split second only to get swept away by waves crashing at the shore.  Obviously, she was trying to ignore the maddening monotony of those sad songs that were being played on a nearby hut.  For a moment she was contented with the solitude but then out of the darkness, save for the lone moonlight; was him, watching her from a near distance. She noticed right away that he was walking towards her. She quickly returned her icy gaze back to the swaying waves.  “I—I’m---sorry—“ he managed to mumble.  She turned her head and met his gaze. “Try not to think about it.” Her voice trailed off into gasps.  And for him, it seemed to be something so easy to say. He meant well, she knew, but words meant little to a worried mind. He attempted nothing more however, and she was thankful for that at least. Kind words were enough on his part. He could do no more harm than that she thought.  “I know—that I’ve done you wrong,” he said  “Don’t try to think about it,” she said again.  There was a subtle resignation on her eyes, as if to say that it was ok to be unwanted, that it was ok to have nothing.  Her words lilting like music in his ears, a single sentence but the pitch, the lilts and the cadences, the nuances of pronunciation made him then realized how it felt good to hear her speak.  But softness lacked the weight of any true resolve.  “I heard that you’re leaving. I just can’t –""  “Can’t what? I’ve been patient with you for too long. It’s time I let go,” she said.  “And what do you suggest I do then?” He finally asked.  He did not expect an answer from her, nor did she fall short of his expectations. Though it would’ve been nice if she had, he thought. If only her kind words could whisk away his problems and maybe a few of her own.  “You’ll be fine without me.” She said softly.  “All along the little lies invade the spaces between our relationship. We seem to get buried with every crashing doubt. I sink every time you make a fool out of me. And I guess now’s just the right time to end this. ” She added.  She looked intently at the direction of the  Polaris  still holding the now half-full bottle of beer. He noticed that she seemed well that night, her eyes twinkling with the sparkle they had had long before they were lovers.  For a brief fraction of a moment, she felt a renewed sense of focus on her being. She felt like an early seafarer, searching for stars for answers.  “I must go home.” Her voice playing in the wind, telling him that all was right as it should be in the world. So she walked past him leaving him alone on the edge of the shore.  As for him, the thought still lingered like a sickness, seeping into the cracks of his mind. She felt it too, he knew, but  not thinking about it  was best left as merely kind words, and nothing more.",23,female

147,"Just when you blog negatively about your husband, he does something that warrants a serious blogapology.  James has been attending a Dale Carnegie class for the last 12 weeks.  He's mostly moaned and groaned about having to go and been less than enthusiastic about the fact that his employer required his attendance at the class but also  required  him to pay half of the $1400 pricetag.  But he still came home every Monday night talking about the people he was meeting and the stories they were telling.  If you've never heard of Dale Carnegie, it's a self-improvement course for learning how to communicate more effectively with others.  So anyway, in the last 12 weeks, James has stunned me several times with his newfound communication skills.  Like several weeks ago when I brought up renting office space.  We were having lunch together and the exact words out of his mouth were ""I admire and respect what you do.  I couldn't work out of the house; I'd get sidetracked watching ESPN all day.""  I wish I could have seen the look on my own face at those words, from the man whom I typically get what I want from, but not without a good prolonged knock-down, drag-out ""my way makes more sense"" kind of fight.    He is the conservative in our relationship.  He worries about the bills.  He has reservations about spending money to make it.  So that conversation that day at the Waffle House was a great milestone for him, because he continued to tell me he could see the value in renting office space and even though he would no doubt worry a little bit, he knew it is what I needed.  Wow.  But it gets better.  He wanted me and Rhonda (his twin sister) to come to his graduation session.  All of the class participants had to get up and talk about a defining incident from the class and their vision for their future.  All of them got up and spoke about what a difference a little communication skill had made in their personal and professional lives.  James got up and talked about a defining moment at work, where he realized the value of the principle of backing up what you say with evidence.  How if someone did a good job, tell them  why  you like what they did.  He said he felt he has always been good at showing support, but he has learned the value of telling people something uplifting to them, not just saying 'thanks'.     So, in the car on the way home, we got to talking about the class - all of the people, what he learned, what it all meant to him.  He had said in his talk that his point was if you love someone, tell them why.  If you like what someone's done, tell them why. He piqued my interest by saying he was going to talk about me, but at the last minute he didn't think he could without being too emotional.  (He is NOT an emotional kind of guy.)  I asked him to tell me, and he looked at me the way he did several years ago when we were dating - the look of 'I'm going to say something you might consider cheezy, and I'm embarassed to say it'.    We had gotten out of the car to pick the kids up and he gave me a great big hug and said, ""You always ask me how much I love you, not why I love you. You're my rock.  My everything.  You gave me two beautiful kids.  You're my reason."" (I'm crying!!)   Now, I have known for years that my husband's love language is in the way he takes care of me and the kids.  It's how he jokes with me and how he acts like I'm driving him crazy.  It's how he usually tells other people nice things about me more than he really tells me nice things.  There's never been a doubt in my mind that he loves me.  Every once in a while, he'll say something and catch me completely off-guard.  But he has never, ever, in 8 years, told me  why  he loves me.  It occurred to me that I never really had a need to know 'why', but hearing him say those words was like standing in my very own chick-flick, starring me.    I suppose I may never hear him open up like that again, and that's okay.  It wouldn't mean as much to me if he said things like that every day.  So I guess I should thank good ol' Dale Carnegie for teaching my husband how to say the things that matter.",26,female

Isn't it so painful when you've thrown in all that effort and suddenly it comes to an end like this. Don't one would feel all used and of in great pain when such a thing happens? Why can't he think of how I've suffered and not think for others? Why can't he just spare few moments thinking of my pain? Isit that I'm of worthless to him? No one understands why it ends in such behaviour. Because when that thing happened in the morning, he was behaving as normally as possible. Smiling, laughting and joking away.

Another (not too common artist) that's pretty good is Rufus Wainwright (his second CD ""Poses"" is better than his first, I think).

The family of the woman who wrote the song appears to be relying on moral rights laws to claim that they still own the song despite the fact that the writer sold it.     The song, popularized in the long-running theater production and cartoon movie ""The Lion King"" was originally written in 1939 by Solomon Linda, a Zulu migrant worker turned songwriter.  The writer died penniless in 1962.  Her family now lives in poverty in the infamous Soweto neighborhood in Johannesburg.     The song has been covered by at least 150 artists, including The Tokens, George Michael, Miriam Makeba and The Spinners.  Linda's three surviving daughters and 10 grandchildren, living in poverty in the Johannesburg township of Soweto, have received only a one-time payment of $15,000.

170,"ST. MICHAEL AND ALL ANGELS' LABYRINTH  - take time to visit the Labyrinth in the courtyard near the parish Center.       The design of St. Michael's Labyrinth is modeled after the one located in the floor at Chartres Cathedral near Paris, France.  The Labyrinth at Chartres was built around 1200 and is laid into the floor in a style sometimes referred to as a pavement maze and is walked as a pilgrimage and/or for repentance.  As a pilgrimage, it was a questing, searching journey with the hope of becoming closer to God.  When used for repentance, the pilgrims would walk on their knees.  Sometimes this eleven-circuit Labyrinth would serve as a substitute for an actual pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and as a result, came to be called the ""Chemin de Jerusalem"" or Road of Jerusalem.       In walking the Labyrinth, the walker meanders through each of the four quadrants several times before reaching the goal.  An expectancy is created as to when the center will be reached.  At the center is a rosette design which has a rich symbolic value including that of enlightenment.  This is where the individual is invited to mediate.  You will notice the four arms of the cross are readily visible which provides significant Christian symbolism and also includes a Baptismal pool.       Come walk the Labyrinth--come experience a  walking meditation -- every Monday morning starting at 8:00 AM with Fr. John Smith.    A NEW TESTAMENT GREEK CLASS FOR LAY PEOPLE  to continues every Wednesday at 8:45 AM in the Parish Center.  Fr. Smith will be teaching an Inductive approach to the Gospel of John.  There is a $35 workbook fee for this class.

175,"Migrain is finally gone and all is good and well inside the head of our famous, little character Frances. Chilling to some Duke Ellington she smiles and wonders about that person who she wonders about when she wonders. Or about wondering about wondering, one or the other or both. Apart from the ocassionally reply from MSN buddies she is undisturbed. Reading though her resume again, seeing if she should add more or take somethings out. Laughing at the fact she had to put her gender because of her name, she coasts through the rest and places it down.  ""Those Bakers Delight people better love me, if not I shall become a Brumby's gal and there shall be a baker's war in which I throw my first attempt of bread at their heads."" she thinks to herself. ""Then no one will be able to stop the rath of ME! moohahaha!""  Focusing off her world domination plan she continues to wonder about that person she wonders about when she wonders. Or about how stupid she was to give Pete her answers as Alex is in a bad situation without any at all.  ""Great! Why do I always help the annoying ones and let my friends down"" she proclaims annoyed at herself. ""If I hadn't had a migraine I would of been able to get the questions back off Pete and give them to Alex. DAMN YOU MIGRAINS"" she cries shaking fist in the air. She cools herself down by turning up Ella Fitzgerald's and Louis Armstrong's  'Let's Call the Whole Thing Off'  and she starts to sing... ""So if you like pyjamas and I like pyjahmas,  I'll wear pyjamas and give up pyajahmas, For we know we need each other so we, Better call the whole thing off, Let's call the whole thing off."" She breathes a sigh of releif and continues to wonder about that person she wonders about when she wonders. Or at her terrible history outcome. How could it come to this? A fail? Frances Hatcher of B plus ville? The one given the highest expectations as if she would succeed? No wonder why she always lets people down. She remembers a time when this was not so. She was a bossy, arrogant, stuck up, know-it-all, little grade 4er who treated her friends like second grade poop. She runs her fingers through her hair and sighs again. ""Guess I'll never know"" she says, quite out of the subject. Maybe she was wondering about that person she wonders about when she wonders after all.",15,female
176,"urlLink Bloomberg.com: : ""In a 2002 referendum, 99 percent of Gibraltar's 20,683 registered voters chose to reject any plan of shared sovereignty of the territory between Spain and the U.K. The Spanish and British governments said the referendum had no legal merit. Spanish exports to Gibraltar last year totaled 420.3 million euros ($505 million), and imports from the territory amounted to 1.7 million euros, according to Spain's chamber of commerce.""

179,"Today was fun hanging out with Mom, Jason, Shayna and Ben. We headed out late morning to Best Buy and then the big mall. I don't think I've spent that much time at a mall....ever! I'm not really a big mall person. I only bought 2 things - a shirt for Ked that hopefully will fit and a cool necklace that I found on clearance for $.97. If anyone is going to find the bargain it will be me! By the time we got home I was exhausted! I fell asleep in the car on the way home, then again before dinner, and then again in the recliner after dinner. So why am I still up??? It was fun and I tell you, my brother is hilarious!! He's full of quick and silly quips and he had us in stitches after dinner.  I chatted with the SupaK this evening. During those chats it almost seems as if we're not 1,200 miles apart. Although at times they remind us of that painful year we dated long distance... big phone bills and long goodbyes!! At least now we have free mobile to mobile minutes. Only 4 more days and we'll be together again!  I'll try to download the week at Elk Lake, but it seems to be the consensus among the Elk Lake bloggers that it just might be impossible to ever convey what took place up there. God was there and He moved. Otherwise the activities included seeing Saved! (which created very interesting discussion and a funny skit for skit night), a viewing of Spiderman 2 which totally rocks, dinner at Mongolian BBQ where we all ate too much and the waitstaff and grillers gave us lots of attention in many various forms! Campfires, smores, hobo pies, freshman guys taking ""baths"" in the lake in the mornings (poor lake!), hemp necklaces, henna tattoos, Switchfoot in the mornings, and many experiences in the kitchen and over the charcoal grill (which I must say my gals did 10 times better grilling than the guys!). But the heart of the trip lay in the discussions in the living room and in cell groups, pouring over Ephesians, discussing community, surrounding each other, bearing each others burdens, breaking through barriers and bondages, and encouraging and praying for each other. When God shows up it's hard to explain in words what happens. We can describe activities but it is hard to explain the activity of the heart and soul. How do you explain developing a love for a group of ladies that can only come from God? How do you explain seeing their hearts open and how they grow? All I can say is that there is a group of students that are extremely special to me, and I am so excited to see where God takes them and how they follow His leading as they move through high school and into adulthood. They've been ""dared to move"" and they are moving.",27,female

Perhaps that we're into the new year and I don't have a clear vision for what I want to accomplish.

182,"[as posted at  urlLink Green Boogers ]   In the last couple of days I've come to realise that I've put my life on hold for a reason that is completely ludicrous, and at the same time, horribly sad. I don't know how to say it so that it doesn't sound theatrical, so I'll just come right out and say it: I've stopped living my life because I'm too fat. By ""not living"" I mean that I don't like to meet new people; I don't like to shop for clothes; I'm hesitant to join sport-related outings; I'm not willing to look for a new job because I don't want to go to an interview as a fat person.   It's easy to give up on diets and exercise regimes and say  ""who cares if I'm fat; it's my body and my life, and I want to enjoy it""  - but sadly the answer to the rhetorical question is that  I care . I  do  care. I don't care what other people think about my lifestyle, my clothes, my hair or my personality, I don't even care if they think I'm overweight - but in a my logic, I think that people see me as I see me, and I know I don't like what I see; why would anyone else? No amount of opposing evidence is likely to change my mind.  I don't think being fat makes you a bad person. But as always special rules have always been in effect for me, so I think that being fat makes  me  a bad person.   Having realised, or admitting to - I really can't tell - the facts doesn't mean that I've actually changed in any way, or that I ever will; great dramatic scenes only have entertainment value and have little to do with my actual motivation. I've learned that I don't actually mind embarrassing myself nor eating my words, as it were, in public. However, at the moment I feel that I'm ready to move on and get a hold on my life again. I can't fix how I feel about myself  [that's probably a lifelong job for a really good shrink] , but I can try to change myself from the outside. Building up from the human wreck I am now  will  be unpleasant, discouraging and slow, and I can't promise that I will stick to it... In case of failure, I will eventually try again, and again. A lot of people spend their whole lives doing this, I hope I'm not one of them.  Damn, I don't mean to be dramatic.  It's just new to me to have energy to even think about improving my life and feeling like I need to get on top of things - who would have known? Leaving work at normal hours, not logging on to work from home and not doing overtime has actually paid off.",24,female

185,"So...our dear friends Chad and Jenny from AZ came out to visit us this weekend. It was quite a breath of fresh air for both Leah and myself.  It was fun to see some old familiar faces and just relax with them. Well...we didn't really relax, but we did to lots of stuff together.  They came out on Saturday, and right away we ate, and then went to buy more food for a bar-b-q with the Cronins and the Pearsons and some other friends at the CC Youth House. Then from there, after many games of Halo, we went to the Angels game. They got worked by the Dodgers and we sat it the furthest seats from home plate. That sorta stunk. After the game, we were itching for more Halo and burgers, so we went to the youth house again. We bought some fireworks, and since I'd like to keep my job, we set em off in an industrial park a few yards from the church.  Right as the last firework was going off, a cop rolled in.  As soon as we saw the cop my mind raced to the worst possible scenario. I'd be sent to jail, fired from my job all that stuff. But I stood still. My first inclination was to run, but that's pretty juvenile.  As Im freaked out and wondering what to do, Chad Cronin is slipping behind or into the car, thinking that will save him. It was funny.  The rest of us stood still as the fire work was still going off as the cop was trying to roll up on us. It seemed like that firework just kept going and going and going.   Anyhoothe cop rolled up, and all he said was (imagine this in your meanest, toughest cop voice) clean up your trash.    Thats all he said and did. He rolled out of there, and I about did a back flip. It was awesome!  On Sunday, we went to Church, saw the CC big ol' American flag and listened to Dr. Schuller do some horrible acrostic to A.M.E.R.I.C.A. yuk. But after that nightmare was over, we wanted to take Chad and Jenny to see our new favorite movie, NAPOLEON DYNAMITE! (seriously...this is my new favorite movie; every like is like a gift from God)  Ok...I'll speed it up, Sunday night, the night of the fourth; we couldnt find a good place to see fireworks. But Leah and I had a crazy idea of trying to park near Angels stadium and watch their 4th of July show. And by the grace of God we turned into a hotel parking lot that had the best view of the fireworks.  It was great.  Monday, we had some breakfast in old town Orange, and they took off for home.   NowIm sick.  I was probably sick on Saturday, I just amped myself through it. I feel like walking around my office in a big warm blanket. Thats how good I feel.    OkBye.",27,female

187,"Yesterday, the long version...   I snuck out of the house around noon and Adri and Steven came and picked me up. We stopped for gas and Adri's mom called (file that information away for later) and then were on our way again. We got to Becky's house a bit afterward (prolly something like 1:00), stayed there for a while, then got a ride to the closest MAX station. We rode that to the zoo, but there Adri's mom called and got mad at her for not calling and telling her when we were leaving Becky's house. Because of this, Adri's mom came and picked her up (go  here  to read Adri's oppinion about that - lol). My mom had gotten home before this, discovered I was gone, and had begun a day-long endevor to call as many people as possible and trash-talk me as much as possible in hopes that it would bring me home faster (F*** you, mom...) Anyway, she had gotten around to Adri's mom, and Adri's mom had kindly offered me a ride home, but I refused it saying that I hadn't come this far just to go back home when my mom told me to (...again).   Anyway, long story short, Becky, Steven and I had a great time at the zoo, though it was close to closing time and I don't think we saw  every single  exibit, but yeah, we had a great time. Afterward, we went further downtown (without paying MAX fare since we were only three stops from Fareless Square - o.O) and ate linner / dunch at Pioneer Place.  We finally headed back to Hillsboro on the MAx and arrived at the end of the line around 7:00. Becky's dad came to pick us up, but informed me that my mom had called and instructed him not to, under any circumstances, give me a ride anywere... That was odd, but whatever. Yeah... anyway, Steven and I just ran the ˝-1˝ miles to another MAX stop, got on, went to the Fair Grounds, got off, ran another 1000+ feet and met up with them at the Burgerville (lol... I'm still not sure why we went there... oh well, whatever). Anyway, we said goodbye to them and decided to head back. On the way back to Beaverton Transit on the MAX, two random college girls came up to us and started majorly hitting on us... The conversation went something like this:  Them: So, what'cha doing later tonight? Us: Um... going home... Them: Aw come on, it's Saturday night, night before break, let's go have some fun! Us: Um... all last week has been break. Them: Yeah, wait, wha...? how old are you? Us: 17... Them: Serious, no way! (to eachother: ooo, ooo, jail babe!) *We kinda just look at eachother right about now, wonder when they're going to go away* Them: (to eachother again: Well, they're kinda cute anyhow)  This kept going on for a bit, but you get the gist of it...  When we finally got to Beaverton Transit, we boarded a bus heading for my house, had an interesting discussion about the controversial restraunt  Hoooters  with a complete stranger, and finally arrived at the bus stop just over a mile from my house. Steven called him mom, who came and picked him up once we got to my door, and I went inside and greeted... my sisters. Turns out that my mom was gone to a bridal shower and my dad was gone to... something or other else.  Anyway, once my mom and dad both got home, they sat me down and mom listed her punishments for me (My dad had no punishments because in his view, I really didn't do much wrong... just needed some time to get away for a while.)  Punishments are as follows: 1. The doors to my bedroom and the office have locks installed on them, I am not allowed access to them for two weeks, which, in theory, negates the possibility of internet usage. 2. I am not allowed to drive for two weeks, though mom did return my car itself. 3. No activities whatsoever outside of school (this includes extra Calculus help after school...)",17,male

So when you really like someone a lot, and you have an incredible friendship, and things seem like they're on a fast track to where you want them to be, the best step to proceed to is definitely:  a) Keep things the way they are, keep spending time together, and hope that you get some clear sign as to how to proceed; b) Make a move, hope it's received well; c) Get drunk and sleep together.

195,"at our community pool, i’ve seen a couple come and go with their little baby and all the baby accessories. once we left at the same time, so we waved goodbye andi saw them pack everything into their blue SUV-thingie. every timei drive by and see that blue SUV-thingie,i smile thinking of them swimming with their baby and carrying more than people without babies carry when going to the pool for the afternoon.    nearly every morning around 10AM, a guy swims with his two dogs on the other side of the lake.i can’t see him very well, so can’t guess his age andi don’t know who he is, but i’ve come to hope he and his dogs will be there wheneveri realize it’s that time of day. one dog is white and the other yellow (labs perhaps), and they love splashing and swimming around the guy – the water goes a-flying. he tosses a stick and they all swim out toward it as if racing and laughing together.i like that guy whoever he is; somehow he makes my day better than it was at 9:45.    i know at least three friends who work in offices and read my blog, andi can picture each of them in their little spaces, working on the work they do (hello, hello!).i like picturing them there; it comforts me to see them even when they’re far away or we haven’t spoken in a while.    oncei had a friend with a little photo of himself in his cubicle with pin pricks in it, he liked to throw pencilsi guess. he said, “me, the target. buti don’t feel that way any more.” he pulled it down and tossed it away.i always meant to ask him about that, and wish i’d kept the picture – even if it was a really bad photo of him.    maybe my friends in their offices are having a bad day today. maybe their bosses are making them crazy. maybe the library members, subcontractors, and authors are being demanding. maybe today rather stinks in their life. maybe that guy with his dogs has only one good half hour in the day, or maybe one dayi won’t see him again. maybe my old friend feels like a target again. and still, somehow, both stranger and friend make my life richer just picturing them, wondering about them, praying for them, imagining their routine, thanking them for what they’ve given me, and even missing them terribly.    my youngest son’s question keeps coming at me, “what is your greatest heart’s desire?”i can come up with some pretty good-sounding spiritual answers – andi even mean them. but then there’s my earthly answers, and self-sacrificing ones,the selfish, the horribly honest, and then my wonderfully honest answers, and i’ve just decided thati must have several hearts for all the desires within them.    how can it possibly be this hard to live here on planet earth? seems the older i get, the more complicated it becomes, and the lessmost of ussee things as black and whitebut instead understand there are many layers and depths beyond our easy glance. we understand better how people do the things they do, even if we don’t agree with them or ever want to walk such paths or just don't have such affinities. but we get it. we can see a hint of waywardness within ourselves or our own secret wishes and it heightens our compassion and understanding. maybe that’s why. maybe discovering deeper levels of compassion inside, desired needsof forgiveness, more substantial beauty in what we’d once pass on by – maybe that’s why it’s hard on ole planet earth.    i don’t know. i’m just thinking here.",34,female

198,"Last night Jen and I were suppose to go meet some friends for a birthday party at Lush 1520 Greenville Ave., Dallas. I hate that place I will NEVEREVER go back and be humiliated like that again. We stood out side for about 30 minutes the friend we were meeting came outside to try and get us in and could not. I would never recommend anyone to go there to stand in line and feel crappy the way I did tonight. So we went up the street another bar and called the people that we were going to be meeting. They said we'll be down there in a little bit well an hour passed and there was no sign. I called him to find out where he was and got no answer on the cell so I text messaged him got no response.After about another hour or sowe decided it wastime to leave. So I call my friend that's still at the party to let him know that we are going, I get no answer. As the night goes on I called 30 minutes after the bars close and get no answer. I'm hating life right about now. Rejected because I don't look the part to get into the club and rejected by the boy that we were suppose to meeting. I know it wasn't his fault that we couldn't get in and it was his friend's party, so I could never really ask him to leave. I just wish that life wouldn't be so hard.",27,female
199,"Well it's been quite awhile since an update.  But I have not forgotten!  Let's start with today.  We finally got to putting together our presentation, we presented the play that I wrote, I spoke on the Roman Gods for ten minutes straight--it was a very boring lecture--but, anyway, Jarrod proceeded to do his Sean Connery impression while reading the lines for Jupiter (many, if not all of which, were written seriously).  I think he got a little carried away, he made a few connery-esque jokes during various monologues, and it kinda pissed me off...But, I believe the presentation went over smoothly.  The teacher slammed us with a poster project due tomorrow, I just finished doing my part of it.  Exciting.  Have you seen those Verb commericals?  You know, with the verbs?  Basketball people playing around, with the word ""run"" flying through their legs, and then a brief picture of them saying ""I love this verb.""  Yeah, pretty lame, huh?  I had a better idea.  Howsabout adjective commercials?  You could have an obese, sweaty, bald ugly guy bending over to pick up the last french (oh, excuse me,  freedom ) fries that he had dropped while slobbering over them, and then, while in the process of heaving himself back atop his trunks of legs, he could raise the fries in his piggy fingers and, with a smile, say: ""Fat.""   It would help people with their grammar even more!  Wow!  Amazing!  Yesterday, during wellness, the kids there and I had a conversation regarding our various encounters with moving cars that we had thrown rocks at.  Some of us had recalled how the drivers had screeched their tires and come back to scream at them, leaving them to only hide in the nearest trench that they could find.  Apparently, one time somebody threw a rock so hard it cracked the windshield.  But, anyway, as this conversation was concluding, our teacher, who is what could be referred to as a femme-nazi, noticed that ""only the boys do these kinds of things.""  Earlier in the day, she had also mentioned how women were ""winning the battle"" against men.  It can be thus concluded that she seeks to dominate and enslave men, rather than be equals to them and be content with it.  If there are enough people like her on earth, then maybe we'd better start making them wear dresses again...heheh...just kidding....  I saw Adaptation with Jarrod and Lily on saturday.  It was phenomenal, one of the best films I've ever seen.  It was written by the same guy who did Being John Malkovich, or, to be more precise, written by and about the same guy.  So many things worked perfectly.  Auggh...it was just brilliant.  I finally finished an incredibly boring art project thing.  I also finished 1984.  What a depressing book.  Yet it is also paralyzingly incredible...  I had hoped, from the beginning of reading it, that Winston would overcome The Party and help bring the world back to the way it was, with capitalism and delusions of freedom, etc.  But, to no avail.  I've written almost twenty pages in Intertwine over the last three days.  I feel so awesome about doing so.  I leave you, then, with my quote of the day, which I murmured while walking away from the school bus, which I usually have to flee from, because of a complex heirarchy of needs and...nevermind...here it is....  ""Fuck you, schoolbus.""",16,male

After that I think I'm going to start a campaign against women, and later I may begin my own country. Sounds cool, huh? Well, the only way to hear about me and my attempts to Nirvana is to read my blog, or call me, but nobody ever calls me. :(  This conversation has been dead on arrival! Fall out boy rocks :D.  Also, if you haven't seen my blog links yet, scroll down and pay attention to the right! Yeah, I made all of those :). I'm working on other people's for other blogs now. If you want to request one then e-mail me at 'notask8r@gmail.com.'  Today was cool because I'm so cool.

205,"I got to talk to Jesse a little bit this morning, but its been rough because my mom took the week off from work and was telling me to do a bunch of things before I had to leave for work, so I was running back and forth doing what I needed to do and what she asked me to do and tried to talk to Jesse at the same time. Jesse is doing good, as far as I can tell and they are keeping him busy enough so I am very happy for that, even though it interferes with our chat time.   The days get closer to me leaving for Anaheim with my mom, her boyfriend, and my two nephews. We are scheduled to leave Sacramento sometime around 6:00 am Saturday morning and are set to return sometime on Tuesday. We will be spending one day at Knots berry Farm (Sunday) and one day in Disney Land (Monday). I am so happy about going but at the same time I am not too sure I am going to be able to enjoy my trip because I know I will be thinking about Jesse, like I do so often.  Tonight my mom and I are going to Target to buy some snack foods and other things for the trip. I know once we get there I probably wont have time to even worry about how Jesse is doing but at the same time that is what I am afraid of. I know if Jesse were here he would tell me to go, enjoy my trip. He would tell me that I need to get away and I should treat myself for my birthday. I know deep down that’s what I should do, but at the same time I don’t understand how anyone can possibly have fun when they have been placed into a situation like I have.  I know all Jesse wants me to do is have a good birthday and to treat myself to a good time…but really all I want for my birthday is Jesse to be home.",24,female

Everything is all about him and what  he  wants. He is the most narcissistic, arrogant, aggressive, self-absorbed motherfucker I know other than me. Which is probably why we bonded instantly: we are the same.  That brain teaser led sort of tangentially (certainly not linearly) to the following theory:   Roald is the reincarnation of my grandfather.  Okay, I know this sounds flaky, but bear with me...I had this sense of ""recognition"" that I  know  Roald. As in before I met him. Like I've known him forever. Maybe the ""recognition"" wasn't solely due to us being similar in personality.  After pondering this a spell, I was lead to the following thought:  If this is true, then what the fuck did Grandpop do to get sent back as a  cat ?  Grandpop was a bit of a rogue (like yours truly), and he cheated on my grandmother constantly (if you knew her you'd know why), but he didn't do anything to deserve being sent back as a cat. That I know of.  It makes you think. Me, anyway.  So I ditched the Blues Fest due to my own personal laziness (Bad, Dave! Bad!), but I did manage to avoid having to go on the road and fight my way through horrible suburban traffic (Hah!). I took the L uptown and did all my errands. Took the L, walked, schlepped bags...Christ on a Fucking Crutch it was great to be a City Boy.   I also had an epiphany whilst on my quick haj: There are some gorgeous chicks here after all.  City chicks.  Cool city chicks.  No shit. They were everywhere. They were practically seeping from the walls as I walked down Chicago Avenue. And many with that desperate I-don't-have-a-boyfriend look.   It made me feel like I  was one of those murdering Islamists after taking out the World Trade Center, being sent to Paradise, and getting pimped 97 virgins to use for my personal pleasure. (Thanks, Allah!)  They were everywhere. Fucking everywhere.  And me so horny.  I was so surprised and shocked I couldn't deal. I scampered on home totally mind-fucked. This has exceeded all expectations.  But at least I think I understand why I haven't seen them until now: they've been inside hiding from Old Man Winter.   Now that the glaciers have thawed, they're coming out from their expensive post-Pleistocene caves to seek the warmth of the sun and engage in the summer mating ritual. How cool.

237,"urlLink Technology Professional Development: A Case Study  This is a new online full-text article from  Academic Exchange Quarterly .  It is by Dolores T. Burton at the New York Institute of Technology.  From the article:  This study examined the outcomes of a technology professional development initiative for elementary teachers. The professional development model used cohort collaboration, multiple strategies, and job embedded experiences to help teachers incorporate technology into their practice. Five sources of evidence, surveys from administrators and teachers, as well as interviews from teachers, computer aides and the staff developer were used to examine outcomes. The evidence identified a change in teacher practice and belief that included an increase in the self-reported frequency of the use of technology, the use of computers for research and project-based learning, and the Internet for instruction. The changes identified were consistent with the Phases of Instructional Change (Sandholtz, Ringstaff,  Dwyer, 1992).",34,male

Taipei is great and everything is going well. The new job is wonderful, I have 4,5, and 6 year olds for the summer camp and then in mid August I will have a class, yes just one, (what a novel idea) I am hoping it will be kindergarten (depends on enrollment) and then I will have one after school language arts class every day. The school is in great spot and has great classrooms and resources. I am looking forward to all the things that go with having my own class even concerts and report cards…. ask me again around Christmas.  The apartment that I found is pretty good, not amazing but I do have lots of my own space and it will do for the summer, I will probably try to find my own place in the fall once I know the city better. There are 4 people who live downstairs but we seem to keep fairly opposite schedules so it works out ok.   Taipei is beautiful, there are trees everywhere and it is very tropical. The weather is around 30 everyday and humid. There are heaps of mosquitoes too, I could do without those. I spent this past weekend staying is a great little hotel not to far away and got some sight seeing done.   I went to a great little Buddhist temple, to an observation deck in the “old tallest” building and to some amazing markets. The streets here are filled with vendors and stalls like in Korea but the selection here is much different and I have seen more chicken/goose parts than I could ever want to. They eat everything, except the feathers. The fruit is divine, I could live just off pineapple, watermelon and mango’s. There is heaps of selection in the grocery stores and most people speak English, at least a little bit. On Saturday night I saw Harry Potter, definitely a high point for me. On Sunday I went to this great market that happens every weekend under a bridge it is divided up into a few sections flowers, jade and crafts, it was really neat.   Today I went to the world’s tallest building (at the moment) it is huge, it’s called the Taipei 101 building and has amazing stores including my dreamy grocery store and the hugest bookstore ( I stayed away from it). I want to go back and just wander around, it has amazing security and the whole thing is quite impressive, the bottom 5 levels are shopping and the rest is offices.   Hmmm what else can I tell you about, not much else has happened since I have only been here for 5 days!

242,"THIS IS GOOD   From   urlLink Brian   about  Farenheit 9/11 .   ""- The woman who lost her son in Iraq was a very sympathetic person. Who doesn't feel for a mother who has lost her son? I cannot be the only person who caught this, but I think others have and are afraid to mention it for fear of seeming insensitive. (I myself have wavered over writing this, and I only get 150 hits a day.) The woman who lost her son said that when she was told, ""she dropped the phone."" I thought I heard that wrong, but a moment later she said she was all alone and had ""no one to hold her up."" I was outraged. The United States military informs next of kin directly, without exception, no matter where they are. For example, they went deep into the mountains in Mexico to inform a lost soldier's mother directly. I am not calling the woman a liar, but I am sure that Moore intended to leave the impression that our military is completely insensitive.""   Is anyone else thinking what I was thinking while reading this?  Moore coached her into saying it was a phone call instead of a face to face meeting.

257,"I'm really, really over-tired, so I'm going to make this as brief as I can.  The Les Mis performances were cool, although to my mind they started brilliantly and ended on a comparative low (I think it would have still been a high if I wasn't judging it against the first night, though). Was über-fun to do. I'm really going to miss all of the peoples who have been really nice during it... mostly James, Harry, Josie + Chrissie, Phil + Christina, Simon, Susie, Liv, Jack, Joe, N'omi, Rhi (obviously), Barley and Tom, who is in actuality an adult-ish but he's so irresponsible it's just funny...  Prime example of Tom's irresponsibility was yesterday. I'll get onto that though, I'll go step by step. Well, afterwards, I got my banner from Scott *hugs* and got changed. Oh, actually, missed out a stage.  Went into town with all the peoples at 3ish, and we wandered round, mostly in Millennium Music where we spent over an hour buying a plectrum (there was a woman called Laura something who Shez knows. Pity Shez wasn't with us at the time. But anyway, she's cool). Met Shez, and I bought cards for Liv, Phil + Christine, Jo + N'omi + Barley, Jake, Simon, James and Josie + Chrissie (my reasoning for not getting Jack one was that I bought him one for his birthday so that can suffice in my opinion. I only have a finite amount of money). That ended up costing me £11.55. Anyway, took t'lads back to my house and went off to Les Mis. You know, then we had the performance which went well. Liv and I both cried quite a lot during Rain. In My Life was as heartbreaking for me as always.  Right, back to afterwards. We had the after show party! Woo! I played the guitar and made up a ""We finished Les Mis"" song and basically the entire cast joined in clapping in time. It ruled. Simon, Phil and I did Californication together and Under The Bridge... this is what you get for knowing RHCP fans. Oh, and I did a Piano + Guitar/Vocs duet, with one of the backstage crew, of Imagine, and that was pretty cool. We also did a piano duet of Peter Gunn, in which I did my tune bit and let him improv. You know how these jazz players are. Seriously, though, the guy was on fire. Not literally. We spent the rest of the time really singing through songs and swapping roles - for instance, Phil and I did the docks, Phil being Fantine and... well, I'm glad that's probably not something people got a picture of. We did One Day More and I got to be Javert! Yay! Found out Liz, Jack's mini sister, is actually... not that mini... in fact she's 16. Now, I find her good looking, so I'm glad she's not as old as I thought she was. I thought she was in like Yr9, not Yr11... that's the only recent misjudging of age that I've made where I've judged someone to be younger than they actually are. But yeah, still... über-cool thing was, she had 2 people coming to see her, and one of them was the flautist (Beccy) for GODS' Music Night, that I did the trombone for way back in October. Well, I talked to her a fair bit. I really didn't expect to see her ever again. That was odd.  Anyway, went back to Andrea's afterwards and we basically... well, sad to say but we did things like this; ""Look down, look down, don't fart 'em in the eye. Look down, look down, you're here until you fart. The fart is strong, it's hot as hell below. Look down, look down, there's 20 farts to go. I've done no fart... sweet Jesus, hear my fart..."" and so on. Sorry, Les Mis fans. It was incredibly fun though. Oh, and Beccy sat on my lap and we were generally closish. Which is odd, given that meeting again ever would be incredibly unlikely. But yeah, she was cool, and not so sensible as last time. Which is a good thing, believe me. But yeah... Barley got pissed on like a glass of gin. Oh, while I think about it, whisky and Pepsi is not a good mixer. Trust me. Liv thought what I'd written in her card was really sweet and gave me a lot of hugs and sat on me for quite a while. I think I'm becoming a bit of a ladies' man. Oh well, it's nice to have someone there. It would be nicer if I actually was going out with them but that's not looking likely for a while, at least. Anyway. Yeah, we watched the dress rehearsal (it was recorded) and I ruled for some of it... I'm sorry, but I did! I'm proud of me at the moment. Getting to sleep was the hard part. At the beginning I was kinda sharing a cover with James but N'omi (who Tom said probably fancied me... not meaning to sound really smug but it was guessable, she has that puppy-dog look with me all the time. Which either means she wants me, din-dins, or both)  said it'd work better if she had less room because she's smaller (like 1 foot smaller) so I went to where she'd been and head-to-toed with Harry, who's small but has really long legs so it's hard to get comfy. Anyway, so I got bugger all sleep.  But yeah. Really tired. That took too long *dies*. The thing about being over-tired is I get very depressed, it's what happens to me, so I'm kinda thinking about someone who lives near Winchcombe a lot.

Salsa as in dancing, not a mexican dip party.  The party was wild and out of control and huge.  So many sexy women with beers in the cleevage.

264,"Per Reuters,  urlLink the U.S. will oppose action by the U.N.  based upon the World Court ruling denouncing the security barrier.  Palestinians face a brick wall of U.S. opposition to possible United Nations (news - web sites) action against Israel after the World Court ruled the Jewish state's West Bank barrier was illegal and should be dismantled.  ""We don't think there's a need for (U.N.) General Assembly action at this point,"" State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said after the World Court, the U.N.'s top legal body, announced its non-binding ruling in The Hague (news - web sites) on Friday. The General Assembly can, and probably will, denounce Israel and demand a dismantling of the barrier.  And?  And nothing, any General Assembly resolution will be non-binding, and the U.S. will block any Security Council motion.  Why?  Because we see that the Israelis have a right to defend themselves against Palestinian terrorism.  Who cares about the judgement of a ""world court"" led by a judge from the justice-and-freedom-loving nation of China.  The Palestinians later intend to take their case to the 15-nation Security Council, where the United States -- Israel's main ally, vetoed a resolution last October that sought to bar the Jewish state from extending the West Bank barrier.  In The Hague, Nasser al-Kidwa, the U.N. Palestinian observer, declined to say whether he would push for sanctions against Israel.  ""It remains the obligation of the international community to ensure that compliance takes place. We will take it step by step,"" he said .... The court said the barrier, which is about a third built, ""severely impeded"" Palestinian rights to self-rule. I want to go on record as saying the major impediment to Palestinian self-rule is the terrorist Arafat.  The Palestinians have had many opportunities to take the peace route;  each time, they have found an excuse to venture down the road less traveled by the peaceable. Opinion polls show strong support in Israel for the project.  ""The choice was between the inconveniences which are caused to the Palestinians -- and we recognize that there are inconveniences -- but the fence doesn't kill,"" said Israeli Vice Premier Ehud Olmert.",36,male

I was getting angry and emotional so I called Arik and everything was better...Can always count on him to make me smile. Hes so wonderful. So yeah that was a big interesting mess that I got myself out of. Anyways then today I got up around 8 and went out to the school for cheerleading. Ugh. I was soo extreamly tired...since I was up late talking to Arik and my mom. So we warmed up and I didn't have any breathing problems so I knew already that this year was better. We worked on some new cheers and did some stunts. We went over positions and jumps and then went to lunch. I walked over to Godfathers...yeah. Then walked back and sat around for awhile cuz no one else was back yet. Then we had cheer talk and then learned a dance. Im really bad at it now..its way to fast. Its to the song Yeah. Wow its fast. ugh. I will hopefully have it almost all down by tomorrow. Then we did more stunts and then got evaluated on a cheer and prep. It was a somewhat fun day I guess...Im just sooo sore. But that just means Im working...getting tight positions and all that. Plus I found out that someone droped Varsity so I might get to cheer some games. I don't know the exsact details to anything yet we'll figure it all out on the first day of school.

271,"so i was cleaning out my booklet of cds and found in there, some of my old skewl cds that i used to listen to alot to remind me of my parents, of home, of certain times and certain people who have been important (in either negative or positive way) in my life .. like, take for example .. MODERN TALKING .. hehe.. for those who dont know what the heck this is, modern talking is some 80s band that my dad loves, and probably still does and we used to travel from Kuantan to KL listening to these kinds of songs .. visiting mom .. those years of long ago .. he used to make us listen to BONEY M too, and after a few rebellious fights about not wanting to listen to some big haired, big braided group of singing weirdos ... we had to succumb to dad's choice simply because it was his car and he was driving .. so that began the whole journey of into dad's head of sing-a-long songs .. =) it makes me smile every time i listen to the two cds, not because i like them, it's because the songs remind me of simpler times of being loved by only your parents and not having to deal with the outside world.  come to think about it, life really was a whole lot simpler then.. i mean yeah ive had crushes and ive rebelled a lot to get to those crushes (countless myriads of british boys in my early teenhood, regardless) but those crushes and so called ""first loves"" have no bearing upon the two big ones that i have had in my young adulthood. in fact, the first one i had just before this one, seemed a lot simpler than the one i have now .. i dont know what it is, perhaps the fact that im a certain awkward age and that i have been burned down once, or perhaps that we are living together, makes it feel a whole lot more ... not burdensome, but weighs a whole lot more.e  simpler times of puppy love reminds me of whitney houston songs .. omg .. i used to come home after school (go Limehurst High!) at the age of 13, dream about a certain hazel-eyed, brunette young man by the name of Paul R. and wish he would stop staring at my fair haired best friend, Sarah and concentrate on the more awkward looking, trying to blend in Malaysian girl, who just started school ..   then there was Stuart F., my first ""real"" boyfriend, age 14. haha, this one is funny .. i had to try going out with him three times before i could settle down with the idea that we are a couple.. it just seemed so wrong, and he was such a scrawny blonde haired, blue eyed, true Aryan boy... i have him to thank for, for the many kissing moves that i have .. haha.. as if i had more than one :p   then there were those hunks that didn't quite look like hunks when they were in junior high but at the end of junior high into middle school, blossomed into the hunkiest of all hunks .. i shared my fantasy and dreams with one of my best friends from england, because we BOTH liked this guy (if you are reading this and recognize who you are, remember those times? when we drooled and fought on who should sit next to him on the bus? hehe) ... the boy in question is no other than Andrew P., also known as PONCHO (dont ask, i dont know)... i remembered in 8th grade, he used to sit across from me in MISSUS MADDOCK's class in Maths, and stare at me and try to get my attention in so many ways .. even Graham said he had a crush on me, but Ponch was such an awkward kid back then.. his hair wasn't properly cut, and he just had a whole lot of baby fat on him still, hehe we used to pinch his love handles to drive him mad ..   .... and THEN ....  come 9th grade, he freaking turned into a HOTTIE .. and not to mention 10th grade in Burleigh Comm. College, he was like, wreaking fermones or sth and all these girls would flock to him, sighing and swooning .. it was kinda cute .. at that time though, i had other crushes already, too many to even list down here .. they were all white boys, needless to say (i think i like my white men, what can i say) .. lets see shall we .. if i listed them all you will die of shock but this is quite fun to reminisce:  1. Paul Rycroft 2. Stuart Freer 3. i think i kinda like Adam Freer too, hehe 4. Andrew Pycroft 5. Mark Adkin 6. Adam Fairweather (more Shazz's thing but he was damned cute) 7. Adam Roper 8. Johnny sth, couldnt remember his last name 9. Lee .. err ... sth he was cute but he became my best friend for a whilee 10. Nikki sth, i just thought he was adorable, but like, about a foot shorter than i was hehe  those are the only ones i remember .. mind you the only one i dated out of all of those crushes was Stuart, for like, 6 months or something, i think, before he dumped me to go after my best friend .. i swear, all the dumpings have been painful for me .. but watever ...   then i came home, and had crushes on a few malay men, but gave up on those and came back to the US to get me another hot white american .. well, after i got me a somewhat decent looking malaysian men who claims to be a chicagoan (hehe just kidding!!! you are oh-so-hot! :p)  ROFL  alrite, time for me to leave this playground and go to another one, that is ASP.NET... *sigh* i wish my prof could speak real english, his sounds too guttural to be understood properly.",24,female

Everyone....  ok maybe not everyone, but 90% of the people in Montreal do not know how to drive safely.Ok, people can say thatthe streets are not fit for good drivers....I mean with all the murder holes, or should I say pot-holeson the streets to ambush these war or assassins' vehiclethat we call cars, are all there to serve as obstacles to ""test"" the driver's skills and verify that the driver is alert at all time...Oh how much I must saythanks to the government of Quebec for public funding to repair the streets...How they always repair that stupid same highway from years to years...(15 on the Decarie level, anyone?) but never repairs some of the streets. Then, to add more problems, well there's the number of lanes in the streets and highways...What's wrong with those engineers....2 lanes.....need I say more...What kind of big city have 2 freakin' lanes at highway interchanges...Turcot interchange(where the 20 meets the 720 and the 15), or how about those freakin' bridge like the Champlain bridge...With a population of about 3.3 Millions in the metropolitan area of Montreal, you would think that engineers would think about making the number of lanes more than freakin' 2 lanes....Ok, so this being said, traffic is really bad in Montreal   To make things worst, as if that wasn't enough..There's the people....YES the PEOPLE. Awww Montreal, where the city speed limit is only a suggestion. Now you would think that with all thedespicable road conditions, people would actually be more careful or drive slower...Guess again, how stupidpeople can sometimes be, is truly amazing. People think that their racing against freakin' Micheal Schumacher...and I don't mean just the people driving regular cars...I mean everyone in Montreal!!!

First, as I wait for the bus at the bus stop, well it can be sometimes really hot, really cold, rainy or snowy depending onthe weather. So as I'm waiting,the buses from the 37 circuit is either too early, or too late...But when you come in a bit late..They never wait for you, and actually drives a lil slower so the drivercan wave their hand and say Bye. Or if they want to be on time, they hurry to arrive early, and they let the bus at the stop so that the chauffeur can have his or her break...away from the bus...so, instead of letting the people in, they let the people stay outside in the bad weather and the chauffeur always go back in the warmth somewhere unknown where all decent or not chauffeur go during breaks. Ok, so after letting the people stay in the bad weather, they let everyone in and show how they have power and control the almighty bus by demonstrating their cantankerous behavior. But hey, it can be understandable..I mean you're driving all day, making about 60k a year, with lots of benefits, and overtime, and you get to be on strike for any reasons paralyzing the whole population using public transportation, oh and you have to deal with people sometimes...Life can be soo hard for them :P...anywhooo..as i wait there to ring the bell to stop just before my stop, i ring the bell...i look around in the bus to see how many people will get out....There's about 5-10 people in the bus but none except me that wants to get out, nothing the driver can't handle.....So as I wait to get out in front of the doors, the drivers starts to accelerate..Then I'm like err WTF,why drive so fast when the stop is only about 100 meters away. Well I start waving, and quickly saw that it was not very effective, so  ......Then as I give the WTF stare and watch the bus driver through the mirror, he doesn't mind me.....So as I walk up the alley to the main entrance of the bus and go to the driver and tell him  me: hey I don't mean to be rude, but you missed my stop...  Bus Driver: oh, did I?(pretending to care) oh I'm sooo sorry....well I just didn't see you nor the stop....  me: yeah it's ok (thinking yeah right Jack A**, you couldn't hear the bell, couldn't see the bus stop sign, and didn't bother looking in your mirror)  B. D.: oh well I guess I could let you out here..(meanwhile he's still driving)  me: yeah here would be nice...(if you really meant it, why didn't you stop before saying it)  ok so this is one of the many examples that reflect the attitude of the people driving in Montreal..FASTER is better....now, picture and imaginethis, imagine a bigger scale of those kind of people, but all driving on the highway or on the streets....hogging thelanes as if the street belong to them. Cause most of them think that because they pay taxes, the street is rightfully theirs since it comes from THEIR money....So you see, people, drive fast..say on average 120 when the speed limit is 70, occasionally cut people cause there just soo many drivers..that people driving fast tend to driver even faster...cause it's not a race, but they don't want to be stuck behind in the so-called traffic, oh and did I mention that we had to dodge the pot-holes, now adding to this, you have the small number of lanes serving a big population of cars...which in the end gives you...a big nightmare...  BTW, it's not just bus drivers..even the ""special"" people from those ""special Olympics"" do that too...the other day I saw2 physically challenged..or should I say freaksin a wheel chair racing on the side street on those electric wheel chair... >.  i'm not saying that when i drive, i'm a safe and perfect driver...but geez..PEOPLE use your comon sense......we're bound to go down as a society....",23,male
282,"I don't understand how a person can break another person's heart, one of which has already been broken several times. i guess the pain takes a deeper cut than before, and then the wound would take longer to heal. I don't understand how I can continue on with my life this way, with all these negative thoughts filling up my mind and only adding confusion to my heart. I don't know why I hold on when I know everything is just wrong and I don't deserve to be treated this way. I'm better than that, and I know that one day everything will be brighter for me.  I never stopped hoping for things to go back to the way they were, but that feeling of hope is slowly fading away with my desperation and sadness. I don't know why I'm still crying and why I still hurt. Every night I'd pray that one day I'll wake up and forget that anything has ever happened. Sigh all I've been wanting is to feel complete happiness..even for just a minute.  You know how you think things are going to end up throughout the day? Then again, you know deep inside that nothing is perfect. So even if that moment even comes close to being described to 'perfect', it never really is. I've never been that good at lying, I'm a bad liar. I can admit to that, so most of the time I try to avoid situations that would make me lie. Maybe the better word for it is 'bending the truth'.   Everytime he looks into my eyes and asks me if I'm alright.. he has no idea how much it hurts just looking at him that way. Every day my heart is breaking more because I know, I know more than ever, that everytime I tell him that I love him.. he wants to believe me, but he can't. He wants things to go the way it should, but we both know that it really can't. Not with the way things are going right now.. not with all the interventions and the pain I keep feeling in my heart.   Life is like a song. Everything seemed so perfect.. it is too good to last. I should have known better, but I guess I was being too hopeful. I should have learnt my lesson years ago, because it has happened once. Look at it now. There's a cut in my heart, and the memories are engraved into my soul. I should have known..   I'm trying so hard not to cry right now.",17,female

289,"So, I was thinking tonight, as I lied on the couch staring at the imperfections in the paint no the ceiling, what would I do if a foreign country, as opposed to a domestic one, declared war on the US and landed on it's beaches and started razing our cities and raping our women and the like? Would I leave and go to a neutral country and wait it out? Would I fight for my homeland? Would I fight for the other side? And in trying to answer all these questions, I had to ask myself ""What does America mean to me?"" meaning why do I love it? Do I even love it? Is it the land, the people, or the philosophy or the ideals or a little bit of all that makes me so attached to the place? And of course, what makes me not want to move to any other place, even after taking into consideration all the flaws in this country?  I came to the following conclusion, I would fight for my country, but not because any president or leader me so, but because I'd be fighting for something more than just an individual. I'd be fighting for an idea, no matter how poorly US keeps to it now, that you are nothing if not free to express and think what you want. It's kind of like how that guy, I forget his name, but he said something to the effect of ""I may disagree with what you say, but I respect it and will die for your right to say that."" So, yeah, I'd fight for my country despite it's flaws because the ideals are great, not necessarily the individuals we have in place now.  In conclusion, I'm not afraid to fight and die for something, I'm just very skeptical about what is worth such an expense.  I love The United States of America, forever my home.  That is all. -- Feanor",16,male

291,"Much cuter than Disneyland. Much shorter lines. Most of the park was reasonably cool and shady even though it was 90 degrees on Saturday. Unfortunately it has many fewer princesses and much less cool souvenir stuff to buy than Disney. I’m in love. Although, I think it’s definitely a place for women and children. None of the rides are scary, and it’s awful cutesy. Probably, the only one who reads this blog who will love the park is Meli (if you haven’t seen it, go, go now!).    For those of you who haven’t bothered going to the website.  urlLink www.bonfantegardens.com  Bonfante gardens is a theme park with an agricultural theme. The main/ first attraction was the circus trees which are really a bunch of trees grafted together to make shapes and stuff. Michael Bonfante made them himself, was the only one who knew how, and took the secret with him to his grave. This makes him a big jerk! And I don’t like him, I hope he’s spinning in his grave about the fact that paramount is running his park and selling their crappy souvenirs.  The kiddie ride part of the park is equally great. Most of the rides are food themed: artichoke, strawberry, apple, banana, garlic, mushroom… and unlike every other theme park in existence that makes all of their rides shiny like a carousel horse, many of these rides were matte. And they had very much attention to detail. Fine lines, shading. The artichokes even had the little pointy tip debossed and painted. It is also the first theme park that I’ve noticed artichokes being sold, granted they were deep fried, but still impossible to imagine being anywhere else. They had a pedal boat attraction, but of course it wasn’t a regular pedal boat, they were duck pedal boats. There were mallards, yellow ducks and swans and they looked so ridiculously adorable floating around the pond.   The strangest part about the park was the total laid back California attitude. You could pretty much do whatever and nazi teenagers wearing leiderhosen or old fashioned dresses weren’t around to stop you. They didn’t offer any instructions on how to drive the pedal boat ducks, they just slapped you in a life vest and sent you on your ducky way. The park was so uncrowded that most of the rides all you had to do was wait for the current cycle to finish and you’d get right on. They made sure you were safe and that your belts and bars were all correct, but somehow it seemed to be more laid back, and that made it run more smoothly. The only thing they were picky about was the 1 adult per strawberry car limit. Even though two of us could have more than safely been under the weight limit. And the words “please keep you hands and arms inside the car at all times” were heard so very little, it was refreshing.   Another great thing about the park is that there is a small mid-way section with games and over half of them involve you winning a prize just for paying your $3. This is how we almost ended up with a car full of stuffed toys, but last second managed to talk ourselves out of it. We did, however, come home with velvety plush roses with a bendy stem.   Conclusion: go, go, GO!",24,female

295,"Sounds like you guys had a good time at Grand Master Flash. We definitely had a much quieter weekend.   I was very disappointed Thursday night. We lost, I did my toe again and didn't go to see Krush. I went to the doctor instead. So the night ended up costing me $110. $50 for 2 tickets and $60 for the doctor visit. It wasn't too bad I guess, I think the universe is telling me to slow down. I had to work the next day anyway and Krush will come here again... maybe in 2008. On Friday night I found that I had lost my CD with heaps of mp3s on it, felt disappointed for a while.   Spent more money on the weekend. I've got to control my spending. With the jerseys, bball, movies etc I've really gone off the rails. Matrix was good though. We have a theory but won't spoil it for the others that haven't watched yet. Talk about it later. I too missed the trailer for the 3rd movie. Will go to watch it again. Also saw DOnnie Darko and Ghost Ship. I though Donnie Darko was a really good film. Definitely creepy in parts. The guy who plays Donnie is also in Bubble Boy and Fresh says that I kinda look like him. Anyway what do you guys think happened. Did Donnie see a future timeline in the instant he woke up and choose to stay in bed or did he in fact go back in time to change history. One thing that doesn't make sense is the engine. The engine is the item which changes the space time continuum. If Donnie died by being hit by the engine, where did the plane come from. The plane doesn't fly out for another month. So the wormhole is still there. could it be that this timeline will revert again at the end of the month and begin again. Forming a loop. Anyway how !@#$ing creepy was the rabbit. Maybe the story isn't so strightforward and its an allegory for another idea. What do you guys think.  I also spent far too much time playing Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom.

299,"I just lived through the second hurricane of my adult life. In the first one, I was living in DC. It was 1999, and I blacked out in my apartment, so I had to go to Georgetown Medical Center for observation. My boyfriend at the time wanted me to come out to his place to ride out the hurricane. We had a huge fight since my mother wanted me to go to my uncle’s house in Maryland. I preferred staying with the boyfriend, but I did not want to worry my folks more than I already was worrying them. So off to the wilds of Northern Maryland I went. I don’t remember much, except that when I returned to campus, there were tree branches everywhere.  This time around, the hurricane missed us. It went up the gulf coast, and all we got was one storm at one-thirty in the morning on Friday morning. It was an amazing sight to watch. I was completely awe-struck by the power of nature. Still, it was just a really harsh storm and not the actual hurricane.  I did not see the fall-out of the hurricane until yesterday. My father and I went to a Muslim wedding. It was my father’s first Muslim wedding, and my second. The wedding was that of a cousin of mine…of sorts.  The true family connection is through the husbands of two of my aunts. These men are first cousins to the groom’s father. The family raised their children Hindu, but the groom had become a Muslim.  On our way to the wedding, my father and I conversed about my life. We talked about relationships, my siblings and my sister’s impending arrival in South Florida. I had been expecting cautionary tales, warning me not to turn out like my siblings. I get those about once a month from him. Instead, thanks in part to a mix tape with  Shania Twain  and  10000 Maniacs  on it, we made it to the wedding with no tears, and a few laughs.  I had never been at a wedding before, where I was afraid to talk to the men. I guess afraid is the wrong word. I was uncomfortable speaking with them. I offered my hand to the groom when I first arrived, and he refused it because I was a woman. I had dealt with that before, but usually with men of Arab decent and they are a lot more gracious about it. They understand that in the US men and women shake hands upon meeting each other. This guy looked insulted that I had offered him my hand.  I spent the wedding talking to the bride’s parents: a nice American couple from the Fort Myers area. They were having a hard time dealing with their daughter’s newfound faith in Islam. Still they were there to support her and her decision to marry a man she had met on the Internet.  Most of Fort Myers had no electricity or running water, including the mosque where the wedding was taking place. Before the wedding, my dad and I went to  Publix  to get a soda. The supermarket was crowded with people, but we were warned as we came in that there was no frozen food, produce or refrigerated items. So we enjoyed a warm coke and drove to the mosque.  The Imam was two hours late. This was the first wedding I ever attended where the reception occurred before the wedding. Everyone was roasting in the heat, since the interior of the mosque was even hotter than outside. There I sat, in heavy emerald green silk with tons of gold embroidery, feeling like I was the wicked witch of the west. The phrase, “I’m melting! I’m melting!” barely even covered the way I felt.  All around us were broken tree limbs and other debris. If I had not seen the intersections without signal lights, and the fact that even taco bell was closed, I would have thought that they had just experienced a bad thunderstorm. I saw some interesting angles for photographs, but realized the wedding party did not have a photographer. I used film on them instead.  Finally, the Imam showed up. He claimed he was late because he was stuck behind President Bush’s motorcade. They held the ceremony outdoors, so we didn’t die of heat stroke. If they had held it inside, I would have had to sit separately than my father. Since it was outdoors, we were allowed to sit together.  It was weird. In the other Muslim ceremony I witnessed, the bride opted to represent herself before God. In other words, she said her own vows. In this ceremony, the bride asked another gentleman from the mosque to recite her vows. So instead of the bride and groom holding hands, the groom clasped hands with this man, and the bride sat to the side looking a bit lost.  The ceremony itself was ten minutes. At the end of it, my father and I said our goodbyes and hopped into the car. I drove, and sped all the way to the other side of the state. On our way home, we stopped for barbecue. I ordered pork. I guess I’m never gonna be a good Muslim.",26,female

303,"a whimsical semi-biographical tale  1997     Prologue   The amazement in my eyes Im sure is visible to anyone who notices me walking down the street. This was not what I knew of Chicago. I knew the poor, the filthy, the hungry. The people were mean and scary in themselves, without even making a move. Around them I felt like a thin wisp of lace at the edge of my memory, ready to crumple into nonexistence at the slightest touch or noise. But here on this street, amidst the lush green trees, the brick sidewalk, the blooming flowers carefully planted behind locked gates, and towering high rises with their noble residences, here I felt like a fine tapestry, protected and valuable, yet on display for all to regard its beauty. Here, walking down North Erie Street, I felt safe, guarded, and grown-up.      Chapter 1    It all began two months ago. Late at night, after working a long day at a boring desk job  clerical, mostly  I tried to relax by exploring the world outside my bedroom, using the phone as my connection to the vastness that constantly escapes me. On the computer screen before me, an ad flickered, changing. I usually dont even notice ads, because Im not interested, and even if I am, I dont have any money to buy anything.

304,"... and other such bullshit.    Hey everyone. Sorry about the long gap in the blogging there. I was actually pretty busy this weekend. I saw ""I, Robot"" on Friday and Sunday (and will probably see it again sometime this week) and would really like to discuss it because the movie brings up some interesting questions. But I have more important things to talk about today.    Warning: today's blog entry will be vulgar. If cursing bothers you then you may as well hit your browser's back button now. I am fuckin angry and if you can't vent properly in your own blog then where the hell else can you vent?    I went out with Meridith on Saturday. I took her to a really nice restaurant here in Jersey called The Cheesecake Factory. So we go to dinner, we sit, we eat. We wound up having a really great conversation and losing all track of time. I got lost two times driving home 'cause we were still having this great conversation that I wasn't paying attention to where I was going. So basically I thought everything went great and that was the impression I got from her as well. My ability to read people apparently really fuckin sucks 'cause the next day I got a text message (a fuckin text message, mind you!!!) from her saying that she had a really great time and shit but only saw us as being friends.    What the fuck?!?!    Okay, before I go on let me make one thing clear. I'm not angry that Meridith turned out not to be interested in me. This was someone who was a blind date I don't really care that it didn't work out. Whatever. No, what is pissing me off is the pattern that is forming here. Prior to Meridith I went out once with a girl named Karen. Karen sent me an email the next day (better then a text message I suppose) saying that she wasn't interested. Again after what I thought was a really good date. So let's take a look at the pattern, shall we?    Going back through my previous relationships or attempts at a relationship: Meridith was a bitch, Karen was a bitch, Natalia was just crazy, Laura was just... crazy, Heather was just... well... crazy, Saxon was... umm... crazy. You get the idea.    So there comes a point where you have to stop and wonder is the problem really these women? Or am I the problem?    The evidence seems to suggest that the problem is me. I was always taught... nah, fuck that, I wasn't taught shit... I've always believed there's a certain way you're supposed to treat a woman. You're supposed to love them, and respect them, and treat them like they're worth their weight in gold. I am a stereotypical ""nice guy."" The kind that women are forever saying they want.    But the truth of the matter is they're all lying. Women don't want a ""nice guy"" that's not what they're attracted to. It's the ""nice guys"" who get told what great friends they are while the ""bad boys"" get taken to bed.    My boss gave me a few books to read by this guy named David DeAngelo. This guy writes about attraction. In these books he essential makes the case, a scarily convincing case, that women are not attracted to nice men. In fact, they are turned off by nice men. We've all seen women who are with these horrible men who treat them like shit and if you're anything like me you've wondered why. Well DeAngelo argues that it is these ""bad"" characteristics that are attractive to women. So DeAngelo says that if you want to attract women you should be cocky, you should make fun of them, tease them about something they are insecure about, make fun of other people, etc.    This approach is completely repulsive to me. But you know what completely disgusts me? This fuckin DeAngelo asshole appears to be right! Natalia always said I treated her better then anyone she's ever been with. But in the end she just wasn't attracted to me. Karen and Meridith both told me what a great guy I am, but in the end they just weren't attracted to me.    So I'm angry. Angry because I'm sick of being told what a great guy I am and then seeing the same woman with a complete asshole. I'm angry because everything I ever believed about how a woman should be treated is wrong! Fuck! As much as don't want to accept it, the evidence is overwhelming. Women just don't like the nice guys, they like the bastards.    So this is my lot in life.

306,"I keep talking about how we are in the home stretch, and while these songs are pretty much up to snuff and just need drum edits before mixing, one song, called one.nine.five.six (which I'll herein refer to as 1956) has plagued us. It's been through several arrangement changes, and everyone has had a feeling for sometime that this track was not quite there yet. So now, thanks to our newest addition Charles breathing new melodic life into the song by adding some new basslines, I was now ready to tackle Track 2 of the new Hypefactor album, which by the way, is the angriest, heaviest song HF has ever done, and will appeal to the few aggression fans who might pick this record up someday.  This song was intended to be our Primal Scream homage. And while it's still a nod to Booby G and co, I decided to loosen the reigns while molding this song into shape. Again, kudos to Charles for his solid work the other night. Because of him, I was able to blow this tune wide open. The track is very loop-based and repetative in nature, so I decided to go over all of these parts with a fine comb. Doing so, I found that these verses could be cut in half without losing the intensity of the song. Originally, the song opened with a quick POW, similar to the aggression's CHEMICAL SUN or Primal Scream's MISS LUCIFER, but after going through these loops, we found several loops and feedback guitar (and of course some of Charles' bass) that I loved and was able to turn these into a cool new intro . B and I agreed that the intro should remain loop based so when the song starts, the impact of the drums guitars will hopefully knock the listener on their ass. At least that is the intention.  During all this, Brandt's musical brain was working overtime and we tracked some new melodic guitars to put over the non-vocal verses. That nailed it as far as I was concerned.   And by the time it was over, 1956 had evolved into something new and exciting. It's in good enough shape for me to now lay down some vocals this coming week, but don't be surprised that once we have the vocals and live drums edited in that this song goes through another draft (mostly because there are so many loops that can probably be removed once Robin's drums are in). Not bad for a song that started 2 years ago with the aggression fooling around with laptops and guitars in my parents living room.  SPEAKING of the aggression, they will have a CD out in early 2005 featuring 14 (mostly unreleased) remixes from the course of their entire history. I'll get further into this as time progresses and details have emerged, but as Dan Hamill says ""Nostalgia is IN"". It is nice though to meet people who appreciate the aggression and their body of work and who want to hear more.  Keeping it old school I-Rock, The MOGpac at Skinny Puppy tomorrow and Monday, look for us. I'm the one with the beard (facial hair, not Ash)  F",27,male
307,"My Decision, Mein Kampf   If you would have told me that a graduate with three majors graduating with top honors, a 90% on the MCAT, and 5 years of research would be rejected from every single choice school he wanted to go to I would have laughed outright in denial.  Denial is my reality.  I was always raised to think that doing your best and working your hardest would be rewarding, not only for your inner self but also for your future.  What I wasn't told was how all this depends on whether or not people will actually LOOK at what you have done.    Growing up I saw my share of racism with my family being from Iran.  Some were more gruism than others but you can never erase those memories and they motivated me to try to make a difference.  I never thought that I would experience a more subtle but equally degrading form of discrimination.  After performing poorly on the MCAT I was reject by over 20+ medical programs (I lost count after 20).  I retook the test relunctantly knowing that everything I had done was overshadowed by one stupid reading comprehension section.  When I got my new scores a great burden was lifted off my sholders.  I was in the 90th percentile and in science I was above that.  Surely this would mean that I would have a shot at my top schools for an MD/PhD program.  Surely places like UCSF, UCSD, and Stanford had to take notice.  I was right up there with them as far as everything.  The reality:  I didn't even qualify to submit a formal application to UCSF, Stanford told me that students like me infuriate them, and UCSD rejected me despite letters from two alums of that school.  I turned to the University of Washington, the only other school in West (where I wanted to be) that had the research I was interested in.  Indeed, 5 days after my interview I was accepted to the MD program.  Yeah right, the MCAT is just one factor.  Reality:  It is THE FACTOR!    I  anxiously waited for the news from the dual degree program.  My rejection came several months later with no reason.  The director said I should do research, perhaps try a summer research experience.  It was obvious my application as not ""looked"" at.  What else COULD I have done?  I'm only a recent undergrad; how can I have more than 5 years of research experience.  It was obvious that the thing at play here was merely where I was from.  Idaho = incompetence.  Need more evidence?  There has NEVER been an Idaho educated student accepted to that program, EVER.  I felt a feeling that I hoped I would never feel again, discrimination.  So, am I being overdramatic?  How would you feel having to wait 2 years to go to a school that wasn't at the top of your list, in a city you don't like, and to the wrong program!  I have a deskdrawer filed with over 40 rejection letters.  Did I have other choices?  Yes.  I got into 5 medical schools and 1 MD/PhD program.  However I have a specific area of interest and want to stay in the West.  Call it stupidity or ambition.  What does that leave me with?  I want a school that is established, has a program I want, and has some reputation.  I'm sick of being treated this way.  There was no ""choice.""  There was only one viable option.  The University of Washington is the anti-Albertson College.  It is almost the exact opposite of ACI.  The people treat you like a number, it is huge, and has a huge reputation nationally.  Alas my ""decision"" is to go to the University of Washington and reapply for the third year now to the MD/PhD program.  I guess it is irony because I don't like coffee, rain, or dogs.  But no need to worry I will spend my first day in the beautiful city of Moscow, Idaho.  I guess that's what I get for going to school in this state, having to stay even longer in it!  When I bump into numerous people they ask, ""So, are you excited to be going to medical school.""  How do I respond to something like that?",23,male

Hosted by Karen Jaime For more info: Fish@louderarts.com  917-209-4211  Tribute Fundraiser for the Rev Pedro Pietri III info at nuyoricanhostess@hotmail.com  ******Following article is from Juan Gonzalez from the Daily News ****************   'El Reverendo' just not ready to leave pulpit     The sad news spread rapidly this weekend: Pedro Pietri, the king of Latino poetry in this town for more than 30 years, is suffering from inoperable stomach cancer.  And what a hilarious reign it has been.  Usually sporting a long black overcoat and a black bowler, with scraggly shoulder-length hair and mustache, Pietri, who was born in Puerto Rico in 1944 and served in the Vietnam War in 1967-68, sarcastically calls himself El Reverendo, the minister of the fictional Church of the Mother of All Tomatoes.  A typical Pietri poetry reading is somewhere between a vaudeville act and a Pentecostal revival. His audiences are erupting in laughter one moment and fighting back tears the next.  For those of us who came of age during the 1960s and 1970s, Pietri's epic ""Puerto Rican Obituary"" - with its evocation of ""nervous breakdown streets/ where the mice live like millionaires/ and the people do not live at all"" - still remains the single most powerful expression of the Latino diaspora in this country.  Other Pietri poems, like ""Suicide Note from a Cockeroach in a Low-Income Housing Project"" and his extended series of ""Telephone Booth"" verses have been acclaimed as first-rate examples of urban street poetry and forerunners of today's rap or slam contests.  Pietri's prolific production includes more than 20 books of poetry and plays. His work has been translated into several languages.  His last performance was Nov. 8 at Town Hall, where he participated in the 30th-anniversary celebration of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, the cultural center he founded on the lower East Side with playwrights Miguel Pinero and Miguel Algarin.  Three days after the Town Hall event, Pietri fell ill.  ""First I couldn't hold down any food,"" Pedro told me yesterday.  ""Then I couldn't hold down liquids. But being a hardhead, I thought it was just stomach ulcers. I didn't want to accept the truth.""   He finally checked into Bronx-Lebanon Hospital, where doctors discovered a malignant tumor and immediately performed surgery. But by then the tumor had spread to his stomach.  Cancer is the latest and most serious of the physical maladies Pietri has confronted over the past few years.  Some, he is convinced, were caused by exposure in Vietnam to the herbicide Agent Orange.  ""When I was in the infantry in Vietnam, we used to see the planes spraying us with that stuff all the time,"" Pietri recalled.  For the first 20 years after his return from the war, his health was fine.  ""Then all of a sudden I came down with glaucoma, then with a bunch of skin diseases and now this cancer,"" he said.  His doctors are recommending radiation and chemotherapy to attack the tumor, but Pietri, always the cynical rebel, has rejected their approach.  ""They did what they could, but I don't want that radiation or to have them just cutting me up again,"" he said.  Instead he has decided to seek alternative medical treatment next month in Tijuana, Mexico, a procedure his health insurance carrier refuses to cover.  So last week his family and his friends at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe quickly established a benefit fund to pay for Pietri's treatment in Mexico. They are asking anyone who has enjoyed his poetry to come to his aid now.  Those wishing to help can send a contribution to the .   Pedro Pietri Health Benefit Fund,  c/o Nuyorican Poets Cafe, P.O. Box 20794,  New York, N.Y.  10009.   ""I'm not giving up. I'm going to kick this thing,"" Pietri said yesterday.  All those young Latino poets hoping to pick up the king's mantle will just have to wait, because Pedro is feeling too good to check out right now.

315,"There isn't a whole lot that I know of about tomatoes but I sure do like the cherry tomatoes. My dad starts planting tomatoes indoors in the back bedroom. He keeps it cool with the door shut and checks and waters them daily. He keeps them by the window with the shade drawn at night and in the morning, when the sun is shining, he draws the blind up so the tomatoes can get some sunlight. He is the biggest fanatic when it comes to his tomatoe plants. My dad last year had a tomato plant and I asked him what kind of plant that was. I thought it to be quite ugly myself. And that was the name of it. The Ugly Tomato. He has even had some yellow tomatoes and I have no idea what they are but they don't taste much different. He plants way too many tomato plants. He had people from all over town in gonvick, minnesota coming over for tomatoes and he has plenty. Gonvick is a small town. The population is around three-hundred. My mom does a lot of canning with tomatoes and uses them mostly when making chili. They sure are much better than store bought tomatoes. Sometimes when I stop over there will be tomatoes sliced on a plate on the table and I will eat some of them with a sprinkle of sugar on them. My dad will put salt and pepper on his and my three year old son will just take and eat them plain. My daughter, Brittany doesn't care for tomatoes much. Bridget, my oldest daughter does though. She will ask grandpa everytime we are there if she can have some tomatoes to take home and everytime he helps her to pick the best ones she can find. She also loves the cherry tomatoes. I'm not as big of a tomatoe fan but I do like them fresh from the garden for a B.L.T.",45,female

318,"It's late.  My husband is asleep, and I am so very lonely. I am so very, very lonely for the touch of a man, for the scent of a man, for the amazing feeling of a man next to me, on top of me, inside of me...  I slip out of bed, and tip-toe to the closet. I reach back, past my prim sweaters and blouses and dresses, to find it... The black skirt, the leather one that barely covers my ass. I slip off my wife panties and pull on my black thong, then step into the leather skirt. I exchange a black leather halter- the perfect mate of my skirt- for my night shirt, and step into my Manolo Blahnik stillettoes. I let my hair out of its ponytail, and brush it with long strokes, letting it spill over my shoulders and neck. A touch of red lipstick, and I am set. The transformation is complete.  The club is on the other side of town- nobody knows me in this place. I stride slowly through the crowd, trying to draw attention, and find my way to the bar. Some kid fresh out of college is tending bar, and I lean over the bar and wave to get his attention. He smiles at me, and hurries over. I try to pay for my Jack Daniels, but he waves the money away. I blow him a kiss.  On the dance floor a couple is standing, arguing. They're oblivious to all the motion surrounding them. Dancers spin and gyrate around them, but they just stand there arguing. Interesting. She's pretty, plump, and about his age, with short, dark hair and dark eyes. They're both younger than me by a few years, in their early twenties. He's gorgeous. His hair is closely cropped, and he's dressed nice in slacks and polished shoes and an expensive looking shirt. He's no punk. Finally, she pushes his shoulder and steps past him, headed for the Ladies' Room.  I leave my drink at the bar, and move towards him. He's still standing there, in a daze, and doesn't notice me until I'm right in front of him.  ""You look sad,"" I say. ""I hope it's not something I've done.""  He's confused for a moment, and replies, ""No, it's my girlfriend. We're just fighting about something stupid.""  ""My husband and I have the same kinds of arguments,"" I say. ""I am so glad he's not here right now.""  ""Where is he?""  ""Home, sleeping.""  ""What are you doing here?""  I smile, amused, and lean to him. I rest my arm on his shoulder and whisper in his ear, ""I'm looking for somebody to fuck.""  He laughs nervously for a moment, trying to determine if I'm joking. I'm not.  ""I think you're very sexy,"" I whisper. ""Why don't you take me home?""  He blushes, and stammers, ""I came with my girlfriend. I can't leave her here.""  ""Even better,"" I say. ""Let's bring her along.""  I tell him my name, and ask about them. He is Danny. She is Heather. They're engaged.  Heather arrives, looking none to happy to see me. Before any fun can happen, I need to get her on board.  ""Hi, Heather,"" I begin. ""I hope you don't mind me interfering, but I was just telling Danny to stop being so rude to you. If there's one thing that I've learned in my marriage, it's that no man should treat a woman that way.""  She laughs, confused by relieved.  ""Anyway,"" I continue, ""Danny and I were just talking about going back to your apartment and having some drinks, then sorting out this whole mess. Are you ready?""  Heather nods, completely shocked. I put my arm around her and tell Danny we'll follow him in my car. She'll ride with me. ""Time for the fun to start,"" I think to myself.  We settle into the car, and I compliment her outfit. She really does look hot. She's wearing jeans and a tank top. Her breasts are plump and firm, and she's got beautiful dark skin.  I question Heather about her relationship with Danny. It turns out they were fighting over one of his ex-girlfriends. She discovered he had been talking to the girl. ""The problem,"" I tell her, ""is that he's supposed to be jealous of you. We need to find a way to make HIM jealous.""  As I talk, I make it a point to gesture with my hands a lot, occasionally patting her arm or thigh. I want her to get comfortable with my touch. She tenses the first few times, but seems to relax over time.  We arrive at their apartment, and Danny pours us all a drink. I push him into an easy chair in the corner, and settle on the couch next to Heather.  ""Danny,"" I lecture, ""you're not giving Heather the respect she needs. You're not giving her the affection she needs. She tells me you don't even kiss her properly anymore.""  ""What? I kiss fine,"" he protests.  I turn to Heather, and gently caress her cheek. ""She's such a beautiful girl, Danny. You need to let her know that."" I lean to her, close my eyes, and kiss her softly. Our lips part just a little, and the tips of our tongues brush against each other for almost a minue.  ""That's how you kiss a beautiful girl, Danny.""  Danny looks down, unsure of what to say. Heather is staring at me, obviously wondering what I plan to do. I guess there's no reason to delay. I kiss her again, pulling her to me, my arms around her back and shoulders. She returns my kiss, our tongues pressing together. My fingers dance along her shoulders and back, glorying in the touch of her bare skin. I kiss her her ear, and her shoulders. She leans back her head, to give me access to her neck. I nibble gently on her throat and bosom, and her breath quickens.  ""Pay attention, Danny,"" I say. ""I'm going to show you how to make love to a beautiful girl.""  I reach for the bottom of Heather's top, and she lifts her arms without a word as I pull it over her head and toss it to the floor. She reclines on the couch, and I spread her legs. She hooks her left leg over the back of the sofa, and the other hangs onto the floor.  I begin with her stomach. I taste every inch of her torso, breathing in her sweet perfume, loving the texture of her warm dark skin. I nibble lightly on her breasts, small painless bites. She caresses my neck and shoulders and back, and runs her hands through my hair. I tease her nipple with my tongue, then take it into my mouth. I suck each nipple gently but firmly. She gasps with each suck, loving the sensation.  I trace my way back, and kiss her stomach while I open her jeans. She raises her hips to let me pull them off of her, and I do. Her panties are cute, small and black and silk. I take her hand, and slip it into the front of them. She closes her eyes, and begins to touch herself while I massage and kiss her thighs. She's lost in the pleasure, rocking against her fingers.  I glance at Danny, who is leaning back in the chair and rubbing his erection through his slacks.  ""She's beautiful, Danny. She's a beautiful sexy girl who just needs the right attention.""  Heather's fingers make a wet sound as she rubs her clitoris, and the pace of her rocking increases.  ""Watch, Danny. She's going to have an orgasm without you. She's going to cum, Danny, and she didn't need you to help.""  Just then, Heather climaxes, letting out a low moan as her back arches... I reach for her wrist, and slowly pull her hand from her panties. It is very wet, and I slip her fingers into my mouth, savoring the scent and flavor of her orgasm. She raises her legs to slip the soaked panties off, and I lay her hand back between them.  I stand, as she begins to masturbate again, and stand in front of Danny. He's still rubbing himself through the fabric of his slacks.  I step out of my heels, and remove my halter and skirt, so I'm standing in front of him in just a black thong. I glance back at Heather. She's lost in her own world, having orgasm after orgasm as she masturbates on the sofa.  ""Stand up,"" I bark at Danny. ""I'm going to teach you the right way to make love to a woman. I'm going to teach you how to fuck.""  He stands, and I order him to undress. He throws his clothes on the chair, and instinctively begins to stroke his hard cock.  ""Stop that, Danny. That's not for you, it's for Heather."" I lead him by the hand to the sofa. I bend over and kiss her on the cheek. ""Come on, cutie. Danny has something for you.""  She opens her eyes, and looks at him hungrily, like a wild animal who hasn't eaten in days. I help her to her feet, and guide her toward him. He wobbles on unsteady legs, but manages to embrace him in a kiss. His erection is pressing against her stomach, her breasts smashed against his chest.  They look at me, not sure how to proceed. I tell them both to kneel, then I help Heather recline on the floor. She is so beautiful, so sexy stretched out in front of me. I want to make love to her for hours, I want to taste every atom of her body, but I hold back. This is Danny's treat.  ""Go on, Danny,"" I say. ""Explore her. She's so sexy. Learn every inch of her body.""  I lie back on the couch and watch them. He licks and nibbles on her calves and thighs while she touches herself. He massages the muscles in her legs, before finally lowering himself to her wetness. He goes down on her, and she reacts instantly. She must be so sensitive, after nearly a dozen orgasms. I slip out of my thong, and begin to caress my nude breasts and stomach and pelvis. He attacks her clitoris with complete abandon. His face is wet. She cums, and cums again, wave after wave of orgasm engulfing her. I reach between my legs, and find myself very wet, my labia swollen with desire.  Danny looks at me, unable to think for himself. He is soaked with her sweet, wet perfume. ""Make love to her, Danny,"" I say. ""Fuck her, but slowly. Savor her. She's so beautiful.""  Danny rises between her legs, hovering over her, then enters her slowly, bit by bit. Heather moans softly, spreading herself wide to receive him. He thrusts in a slow rhythm, and she pulls her knees toward her shoulders, opening herself for him. They are gorgeous. Her, beneath him, legs clenched, breasts swollen and aroused, eyes closed, mouth open, gasping with each thrust of his cock, her fingertips digging into his back, pulling him into her. Him, inside her, his wonderful young ass tight as he pushes himself inside her. Sweat covering their bodies. Lost in each other. Lost in the desire.  Their fucking intensifies, quickening. Danny is on the brink of orgasm. I am wet and overcome with arousal. I am going to cum, but not this way. Not alone.  I stumble off the sofa and crawl to them. I kneel beside Danny, and bend to his back. I kiss it gently, then kiss his buttocks. Then, wanting him, needing him, I bite him roughly on the ass. He moves more quickly, fucking, fucking, fucking Heather. I wrap my arms around his waist, and pull him, forcing him away from her. He tumbles to the floor, and I take his place between her legs. Heather grabs the back of my head, and pulls me to her wetness. I devour her, pressing tongue and lips against her sweet, wet clitoris.   She screams. ""Ohhhhh, yessss, ohhhhhhhh.""  Danny is behind me now, He seizes my hips in his hands, and quickly, roughly forces himself inside me. Such a great cock, so big and so hard. I move in rhythm with his thrusts, raising my ass and hips to meet his push, while Heather bucks and moans beneath me. This is Heaven. This, the taste of a beautiful girl on my wet lips and the cock of a gorgeous young man inside me, is Heaven. My breasts bump against the floor, and it hurts, but I love it.  Heather's body rocks with ecstasy and she struggles for breath. Danny fucks me, faster, faster, faster, and I can tell he's going to cum. ""Yes, baby, fuck me. Cum for me, Danny, cum for me!""  He thrusts again, pulling me onto his cock with all his strength, and his body shakes as my orgasm meets his. His hot cum fills me, and covers my pussy and thighs and runs down my leg.  We collapse, the three of us, naked and spent and covered in sweat and semen, and sleep until morning...",27,female
319,"Pleasure   To overcome my stupid depressive thoughts. I figured I need to get myself organised. Came out with a list of things to do.   1. Save. Seriously, put aside money per month and use it on rainy days.  2. Take a roll of pictures per month and get them developed. Taking pictures make me happy. 3. Treat my parents to a movie/dinner to somewhere new per mth.  4. Get that blardy car license soon. Either that, or to sit the IELTS english paper and pass it and get my arse outta of Singapore. 5. Watch a movie per week.  6. Write at least an entry per week on the blog.  7. Make good use of that gym membership that I have been neglecting. Lose that weight really.   That's quite a bit. Hope to stick to it eventually.   I got 6 pending rolls that need development. Hope the pictures will turn out well. Hope my pay will check in real soon. Sheeesh. Nite.",24,female
320,"My history test is over and done with.  We can just leave it at that.  Although I don't think I did exceptionally well (it has never taken me the full exam time to complete a test before this one), I am fairly certain that I at least passed.  In other news, I began to unwind from this horrible week by going to tonight's Bruins and Rangers game.  It was, as usual, a lot of fun!   urlLink Gonchar  scored his first goal as a Bruin, and good old Joe got the other two red lights tonight.  The people watching was at its prime- there are so many entertaining imbeciles there to pass the time (and the nachos aren't terrible, either).  Hockey seems to make me feel better- Vinnie's proposal includes one hockey game a week to relieve stress.  If he finances this method of treatment, I won't be too opposed!  I can begin collecting the souvenir cups- you can never have too many!  Hopefully spring break will make me feel better.  I got approval to stay in my dorm for the week.  I figured the office of residence life and housing might as well approve something, since I didn't get the RA position.  No big deal, I can have more time to myself and less time detracted from my studies and other such ventures.  Spring break has commenced and I am, once again, free!  The man can't hold me down anymore!!!  Okay, gotta go to bed- work tomorrow morning at 8!  Later.  *me*",23,female

322,"Hello everyone!      I am posting this as a warning to all of you, who may be thinking of purchasing something from the Internet at any time. This is not spam, and is entirely from my own experience. The details in this story are facts, and happened to me over this last week. Please feel free to pass this on to anyone you'd like; this is meant to serve as a warning, and hopefully to prevent you from having horrible customer service, like I have.      Over the last week, I've been browsing the Internet for a certain pair of speakers, Harmon Kardon Soundsticks (USB version). These have been discontinued by HK, but are still available online. I did some searching, and saw that not only did Buy.com list them at the lowest online price ($165), but included free shipping. Because Buy.com's warehouse is located only a few hours north of me, it should take only a day of in-route shipping to get here.      Before ordering, I sent them an e-mail on Wednesday to try and find out if they were new-in-box or refurbished speakers. After not getting a response by Friday, I figured I'd bite the bullet and take a chance; after all, I wanted the speakers either way.      I placed my order at 10:30am PST (1:30pm EST) on Friday; Buy.com's web site states that in-stock items usually ship same day if ordered by 4:30pm EST (1:30pm PST) - I obviously met this requirement. I checked their website around 4pm PST, to see if it had shipped. It was listed as being ""Sent to Warehouse"". As you guys know, companies sometimes take a while to update their websites and with the weekend, I wasn't overly concerned.      Monday rolls around, and I still haven't gotten a shipping confirmation e-mail, and their website still listed my order as ""Sent to Warehouse"". I sent Buy.com an e-mail through their website asking for a status update. (Side note: Still no reply to the first e-mail I sent on Wed.) I went to school and didn't get a chance to think about it further until the afternoon. Around 3pm, there was still no update via e-mail or website. I attempted to find a phone number on their website to call, but there was none - at all. I thought this was odd, and tried a Google search for their contact information, which turned up nothing. I decided to do a WHOIS search on their domain, and got a phone number through that. But, it was past 5pm now, and I waited to call until Tuesday.      Tuesday morning, still no new information on my order. I called the number, and got over to an order representative. She informed me that the speakers I wanted were on ""surprise backorder"", and had been for over two weeks. (Surprise backorder? Was there suddenly a rush on discontinued 2 year-old USB-based speakers?) They had no ETA as to when they might come in stock. But wait, doesn't their website list them as in-stock? They sure do - and the lady had no idea why. Why was I not informed of their stock status before, during or after placing my order? She had no idea, and apologized. I was upset at this point, mostly for wasting nearly 4 days waiting for speakers they didn't have, but decided to see what other Internet retailers had the speakers, and simply take my business elsewhere.      5 minutes later, I checked eCost.com, and found they had them for only $169.99; not too much more, and they also had free shipping. I called the phone number CLEARLY shown on the top of their web site, and confirmed they were in stock. I placed my order, and less than 15 minutes later, was very happy again. I decided to call Buy.com and cancel my order. Upon getting a hold of a customer service rep, she kindly took my request to cancel the order.      Fast forward to 3:30pm PST. My order from eCost.com has already shipped, and should be here tomorrow (Wednesday). Then I get an e-mail from Buy.com. It seems that ""Unfortunately, this item has already entered the fulfillment process and we were unable to cancel it."" Wait - how has it entered fulfillment? They can't ship or bill me, because they don't have the product. And they have no ETA on getting the product; so how can they not cancel the order? (Keep in mind, they have an authorization charge on my credit card for the speakers; their policy, however, is not to complete the charge until the item ships.) I call them once again, and the customer service rep informs me that she cannot just cancel the order; they have to e-mail a ""request to cancel"" to another department. Wait, what? How does that make sense? You take the order, you can cancel the order. Who does business like this? At this point, I'm getting upset and ask to speak to a supervisor.      A supervisor finally gets on the line and insists that he can't do anything. I grill him about their policies and how they operate for nearly 30 minutes, but he still only apologizes and says he can't do anything other than e-mail this other department. When I asked about this department, he confirmed they were in the same building - but he couldn't call them OR physically go there to them. I ask to speak to his supervisor; he's the ""most senior person on duty"". When asking for anyone higher, there's no one there. Now he's really pissing me off. I ask him how his company can operate by lying to customers, stealing their money and then ignoring them. Still nothing but apologies and ""we can only send a request to cancel the order"". I remind him that one request has already been refused, and ask what will be different this time around; he has no answer.      Fine; let's sumbit another request. How long will this take? ""You shold have a reply to the request in 3-5 business days."" Wait, what the hell? Not a cancellation - a reply; they can simply say NO again. And I have to wait 3-5 business days for this? Now I'm pissed; and as most of you know, you don't piss off a Heltsley. ;) I tell him to send the request, and tell him that his company sucks and hang up.      I call back, get the operator and ask for their legal department. After the transfer, I find that most everyone has gone home (it's near 5pm PST now), but the lady there takes a message and promises someone will get back to me within 24 hours. At this point, I reply to their ""refusal to cancel"" e-mail and re-iterate that I want my order cancelled, now. I also call my credit card company, but they can't block the charge approval; they tell me to refuse the item if it does get shipped to me and then call them back, and they'll get my money back.      So, here I am. Lied to by website, ignored via e-mail, and money stolen by a company with questionable business practices. So I do what any American does - tell everyone he knows never to buy from them again. As most of you have worked in retail at one point or another, you know the saying: An angry customer tells 10 friends never to shop there again. Well, I'm letting you know and asking you to pass on the story (in whole or part, your choice) to anyone you know. I know it won't really hurt their business, but if I can prevent any of my friends from suffering as I have, I'll feel better.      I'll feel better after having a chat with their legal department tomorrow, as well. ;)   - John",26,male
323,"Today: Early Out! oh yah. So then I went to Kinky's house with Travis to take apart our RG. We've been putting that off for like 5 weeks, and it took us around 5 minutes to do. So then we killed about 4 hours at Andrew's house. We drove around, walked around, I tried to ride his bike in a skirt (haha), played poker (or tried), played spit (and lost to Travis), and then we played BS (btw, Andrew isn't very good jk lol). So after watching Andrew blow up 2 peanut cans with a gun we went to the movies.  Well, none of us are 17, I'm the oldest, I'm 15 lol. We wanted to see Dawn of the Dead. So I tried to pretend I was 17. Unfortunately, that didn't work. So then we got tickets to see Walking Tall. We got there, and I really didn't want to see it so then Andrew asked the front desk if we could switch to Scooby Doo 2.... (sad... we know) So we went to Scooby Doo 2, and we were the only ones laughing. I swear we enjoyed it more than these little kids lol. Of course, if we'd been smart at the beginning we would have bought tickets to Hellboy, which was right next to DotD and then gone into that one. But no... We just couldn't think that fast.

324,"At age thirteen, when I invited friends over, I'd tell them: ""Self-service!""  I wasn't a very good host.  I remember someone being shocked when I came back from New York and was actually serving her drinks like a semi-proper host.  I was the family baby in Malaysia. When guests came, my elder sisters did all the drink-serving and small-talking. Everyone just told me to get out the way.  It was only in New York, when Mom had to rely solely on Adik and I, while entertaining guests, that I picked up the skills of a host. So, while Mom planned the party and entertained the guests, Adik and I made sure the food and drinks were continuously available, and I even picked out poor lone-wolf guests and brought them into Mom's fold.  I enjoy the running of a party. There's so many balls to juggle, and it's fun to juggle them.  But I have yet to master  planning  a party. Me and plans don't do very well. I'm more a trouble-shooter. If we're suddenly out of Coke, I'll suddenly pop up with a solution. But to figure out how much Coke we'll actually need?

325,"Tossing and turning, I get up and realize that I need to clip my left hand fingernails to prepare for praise night's heavy duty guitar playing.  Currently I await my rommate to finish hhihs shower so that I can enter the bathroom and get the nail clippers.  After the last post I laid in bed, tossing and turning.  I got up, and went through the set list again.  I realized there were too many songs, I took one out.  That's when I noticed my long fingernails on my left hand were hampering my fingers from properly form the chords.  They weren't that long, just long enough to make a difference, maybe one and a half millimeters long.  Tomorro is Wednesday.  A day of much preparation to brring a lot of stuff home.  A day in which I will determine myself to make a difference in my life instead of passively letting my flesh and its fears freeze me into falling into the same pattern again.  Snow is falling outside.  My roommates take a break from their bout of Mario Tennis to note the layer of snow that has already formed.  Winter is here, already.  Seasons change, but do we?

It's how we handle the small things that indicate how we handle the big things, right?  My roommates are getting more into their Mario Tennis Match.  I sit here typing, eyes closed, in my stream of consciousness, connecting, waiting for the next significant thought to appear.  Strong Bad, on the Homestar Runner site, noted in a recent email cartoon that ""the Internet is place where nothing happens, nothing.""  I agree with him.  To a certain degree.  Smalville episode was interesting today.  Kristin Kreuk seems to be the main draw for everyone I know that is hooked on the show.  Me?  I watch the show because I was into comics as a kid, and it's interesting to see the plot twists and turns.  Kristin is quite attractive, but that's such an impersonal medium.  Since friends started to idolize celebrities in the 5th grade, I sometimes bought into the whole ""ogle the celebrity female"" thing, but not much.  When I entered puberty, it became more of a physical thing, but I never really went crazy about obsessing over some stupid celebrity like I noticed many other guys did.  I noticed the girls around me, and was more content about finding interest in them, because they were real, and they were fun to talk to.  Since then, it's been the same.  I don't really care to admire celebrity females, because my heart doesn't buy into the cultural definition of beauty.  Well, to a certain extent.  It tends to fantasize more about girls I've met.  don't take that the wrong way.  fantasize as in, smitten, as in, admiring beauty.  my roommate is done his shower.

327,"Keith Barton, a magician in Hueytown, Ala. with Mississippi ties, received national attention after Matilda, a 14-year-old chicken featured in his magic act, was officially named the ""World's Oldest Living Chicken"" by Guinness World Records.  Barton was born at Keesler Air Force Base, grew up in Gulfport and graduated from Harrison Central. His father, James Barton of Orange Grove, still lives in South Mississippi.  During the ""Mort the Mystifying"" magic show, Matilda's role is to appear in a pan that contained only an egg yolk and some hot sauce moments earlier. Barton's wife, Donna, is also in the act as the magician's assistant.  Matilda has practically doubled the lifespan of a normal chicken, which is 7 or 8 years. Matilda has never laid eggs and is very pampered, and Donna Barton said she believes both contribute to Matilda's long life.  The Bartons began performing their magic show in 1989 for children at libraries and churches. In July 1991, Matilda made her magic show debut.  Barton is a member of the Fellowship of Christian Magicians, International Brotherhood Of Magicians and Ring 35 (Judge Arnold Drennen Ring) of Birmingham.

329,"My last Sunday night at the hotel. My last night at the hotel.  The housekeeping ladies threw me a small party with a cake. I had no idea I was so loved . . . as a group they hate the hotel management and I habve never really bothered to hide my contempt for the owners of this place, and as such, they have always appreciated my barbs towards the higher ups.  mad props were thrown all 'round . . . in an almost haphazard, willy-nilly fashion  now there is less than two hours left in my sentence and I can go back to  enjoying my Sunday nights . . . . I have an entire season of Simpsons to catch up on now.    Then, Graduation.  I'm not too sad, but it will hit me when I'm in Toronto and lonely - not so much for the individual people that I'm leaving behind here at Queen's, but for the lifestyle that I have experienced as a 19 to 24 year old.   For instance: last Tuesday, Bob (my housemate) and I threw a kegger. Bob  bought a keg of Keith's and refused to charge admission for it. Free Beer. (Bob works three jobs, two of which are merely titles right now, but he gets paid quite well - it's a long story involving our third housemate who moved out in December and far too boring for this piece of the Internet) Anyway, the beer was just Bob's way of having a good time.  And a good time was had!!!!  We had a ton of people over and drank about a third of the keg (we had a  further get together Friday night for hockey and partially-flat Keith's) and anyone there could not have cared less about the next day. I played an acoustic set of music with my lead singer in the living room and was in heaven for an evening.  It's evenings of the like that I will miss when I'm stuck at home in my parent's house in June. The Complete and Utter Lack of Responsibility. Friends who live - at maximum - ten minutes away and we only need a designated driver if we're going to steal shopping carts from the A across the street.  Strangers that become formal dates that become 'sleepover friends' all in the span of an evening.

It gets knocked for that reason yet I have loved just about every moment (well, barring a month here and there) that I've been able to spend at it. It really is a world unto itself and I've been lucky enough to take advantage of so many opportunities that it has thrown my way.  I'm happy I'm here. I'm happy to have been here.

334,"Updates and Lil' Tidbits   Back in action!  1)Yesterday was my first doctor's appointment in the last 8 years.  I mean, I've BEEN to the doctor since then, but I now have a real doctor in the city that's all my own.  It feels GREAT to be an adult for once.  The check up went perfectly.  He said that I am in excellent health.  The only bad thing he noticed was that I have a slight tremor (I was unable to touch my nose with my eyes closed).  He said that it may be caused by my quitting smoking or by not eating breakfast yesterday morning.  Either way, he's going to monitor it over the next couple of months to make sure it's not something serious.  BTW, I can touch my nose with my eyes closed now that I'm out of the office.  Figures.  2)My anniversary with Paul was wonderful!  His gift to me was perfect.  He bought us two handmade silver rings from a jewelry designer ( urlLink Jill Platner ) in the city.  They are beautiful rings.  On the inside of mine it says ""APG loves JHC, 1/9/2004"" and his says ""JHC loves APG, 1/9/2004"".  We are both wearing them on the middle finger of our right hand.  I was very moved by the gift.  After this, Paul took us out to dinner at  urlLink Lupa's  and we had a great dinner.  The wine was SO good and the food, although it was gourmet style and looked foo fooish, was excellent.  The whole night was memorable.  3)I didn't end up doing the five senses gift.  I am running VERY low on money and was unable to buy him a gift this year.  Instead I remodeled his bedroom.  I decorated it, organized it, and whipped it into shape.  He was VERY excited and happy with the gift and I saved me some extra pennies, which I am in desperate need of.    4)For Mariah's Christmas gift, I overhauled her bedroom too.  I wish you could see it.  In the 4 years I have been friends with her, Mariah has never had an organized, clean bedroom.  Now she does.  I told her that I would be giving weekly inspections to make sure it stays that way.  And I'm serious.    5)On Friday night we went out to Splash Bar.  I think everyone had a blast.  I know I did.  BUT, there was one rough moment.  There were these three middle aged queens hanging out in the bathroom at the same time we were and they would not leave Mariah alone.  I pulled her away from them and they got pissy.  I then asked them to leave us alone as we didn't want to hang out with them.  This one guy got really angry and called me ""bald"", which I didn't like very much.  I then told him that he was an ""ugly 50 year old man that is obviously spending his night alone"".  He didn't like that very much and grabbed my shoulder.  Now, I do NOT like when people put their hands on me and I tend to turn into a huge psycho.  I started telling him to ""remove his fucking hands immediately"" and he kept pushing me and rubbing my head.  Eventually the bouncer came over and asked me if this loser was bothering me.  I said yes and proceeded to walk with the bouncer to the entrance.  Fuck head got BOUNCED right out the bar.  I felt so powerful and dared all of my friends to mess with me.    6)My brother is being nominated for a  urlLink Bronze Star !  Read up on it to find out more.  My family couldn't be more proud.  7)I saw  Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King  last night.  I must say, this trilogy is by far my most favorite trilogy ever.  I could watch it over and over and over.  The last installment is surely Oscar worthy and will prove that point once the Academy Awards roll around.  I won't give anything away, but dammit, it is rare to see a movie of such caliber.  Thank you  urlLink Peter Jackson  for directing this masterpiece.  8)Ari informed me that there is a new remake of  urlLink Dawn of the Dead  coming.  She showed me the trailer while we were at work on Friday and I still can't get it out of my head.  FUCKING YAY!  9)I had one cigarette on Friday night.  I caved and had it all by myself in my bedroom.  I haven't had a single drag since and am still quitting the smokes, but I did cave once and thought I should be honest about it.  Unfortunately, the Nicotine patch is giving me a horrible case of insomnia.  I have to try removing it before bed tonight to see if that helps.  I'm barely surviving on 6 hours of sleep  for the last 3 days.  That should be it.    I have rehearsal tonight.  We found a space for our February AIDS benefit.  I am really excited that this is moving forward.  I have to memorize another script during my lunch break today and I should be ready to go.

335,"This week was undoubtedly one of the most hectic weeks for the past 2 or 3 months. Almost every evening i was meeting my house broker to see various houses. I finally decided on one house this thursday. Its pretty much sufficient for one guy ;) .. with a good bedroom, hall and kitchen and ofcourse the bathroom. Its on the first floor, near a park, in a very silent lane [ except for a couple of dogs i guess ;) ]. The only thing new for me now, is to learn to stay alone :-(, with my earlier room-mates shifting to separate houses. It was such a pleasure living with them. I hope to keep meeting with them often even after we start living separately.  Every eveving, I had to rush to catch hold of this broker since he usually is not available otherwise. They are so much in demand these days in Bangalore. On the weekend, when i actually met my new house owner, the broker had another customer literally sitting on his head asking him to show him some house he promised. The owner seems to be a nice guy and i hope to not have much problems. The best thing about this house is that the owner stays about 25 kms away from my new house. I am sure its one real good thing that made me decide on this house.  As if this was not enough, our test engineer for Evolution Exchange connector, suddenly woke up from his slumber and started filing bugs left right and center. The bug count dramatically rose up [ which was quite expected if anyone tested the component ;) ]. But, unfortunately, most of the bugs were very rare case scenarios or negative test cases and not so interesting to fix apart from a few good ones. I have started working on those interesting bugs for now. One very interesting bug is that, if i get a task forwarded as an ics file and i accept it, evolution hangs. Well, that was what the bug said, but my RedHat 9 box, had a pretty different story to tell me. Whenever, i tested this bug, it was just not evolution, but the whole machine that was getting locked up. I could see the CPU being hogged [ the CPU red light was glowing continously ], and no keyboard inputs were being accepted. I tried a ssh to my machine from another test box, but that also timed out. Was very annoying to have to reboot my machine after it being up and running for a month :-(. To gather more info about this bug, i left it hanging in the evening and came back in the morning and saw that the machine had reached some sanity and was recognising the keystrokes, but was nevertheless damn slow. So, i have decided to debug this on the tester's machine itself ;)  Before i forget to mention, there are a few very nice blogs written by  urlLink fejj  which i would like to mention here. One is on  urlLink profiling tools , another is on  urlLink effective searching  and a follow up of this on  urlLink binary search trees . These are all quite elementary in nature, but i liked the approach in which he explains this. And as he later points out, there is a wealth of knowledge on different tree implementations at  urlLink http://www.msu.edu/~pfaffben/avl/   This week is gonna be another busy week, and i am planning to do some reading too :-) Hope i am able to balance my time between hacking and reading.",26,male
336,"Okay wow, Macs piss you off.  And I don't know why.  But they do.  After receiving some post WWII era Macs (no pun intended, seriously, they run 33mhz at top speed), I think these might have been the Nazi Party's secret weapon.  And think about it, its genius!  To develop ""boxes"" with TV screens and an advanced recording system that somehow plays a series of scenes on the TV screen, fooling the user that they actually bought a working computer!  After a while, the user gets enraged at this machine since it does absolutely nothing.  Also it has eye-burning colors that just suck.  After repeated attempts to operate the Nazi TV Box, the user becomes angry and punches it in the screen, which would electrocute him and he would die.  Now all the Nazis had to do was mass-produce them in a wide variety of colors and sizes, and then to put them onto the market at reasonable prices, and you have the Macintosh corporation.

338,"I can't be alone in the world wishing that Robert Winston would shut up. His recent  urlLink outburst directed towards Prince Charles  has just made me dislike him even more.  I happen to think that Prince Charles is great at raising public and political awareness about issues. Let's face it, the man has a lot of time and resources at his disposal to enable him to actually research these areas that concern him and many others. Besides anybody who tries to make a bit of trouble for greedy politicians is alright by me. I know he gets it a bit wrong sometimes, but generally I think he's right to make people sit up and listen. In the  urlLink Indie article  he explains that it is nanoparticles that really concern him (and not robots) and I for one think he's right in asking for more research into the effects of such compounds. The effect of using nanoparticles in contact with the skin may be very different from ordinary sized particles. I think the point is here that we just don't know, and a real effort to reassure people with facts is required. Winston's and other people's reactions to Charle's opinion doesn't help the situation. This kind of attitude is precisely what makes people suspicious in the first place.

342,"I'm heartened to know there are Singaporeans who believe that money isn't everything. I hope that I never forget that... Of course, there are those also those who believe that money is progress, like the other letter-writer in today's forum page. And he quotes LKY too:  ""My point to Mr Stefansson is that if one stops striving to achieve more, to be better than one is now, to set a higher target once the target is reached, one has stopped progressing.  Why do you think Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew is exhorting Singapore not to rest on its laurels and stay at 30,000 feet? He thinks that Singapore can and should climb to 36,000 feet."" - - PETER TEO BOON HAW  Exactly. WHY? Mr Teo, progress for the sake of progress, is why Singapore is the way it is today, a place with no respect for the past and no sense of the present. We are obssessed with better. We are obssessed with new. So much so that one of our  tabloids - more than a decade old - is called ""The New Paper"".  An apt name, come to think of it - one which describes Singaporean mentality. Building too small? Tear it down! Replace it with something bigger, something better, something new. Nevermind that the building is still in perfect working order. Nevermind that the building holds memories dear to Singaporeans. Nevermind that renovations were just carried out a few years ago. Why have pseudo-new when you can have a brand new, bigger, better building? Progress? Mr Teo, think hard about why Singaporeans are so depressed nowadays. I say it's because we've been told - no, ordered - that staying at 30,000 feet is not progress, Not good. Ironic that he quotes Ben Franklin saying, ""Who is rich? Someone who realises he has enough.""  Maybe we should realise that we have enough. We complain about not having things to do when the reality is that the weekend comes and we are too tired to do anything. Why? Progress. We have to, we must, climb to 36,000 feet... then 50,000 feet. And then we'll finally reach the outer limits of our atmosphere. Suddenly, we'll realise that we can't breathe and that we're about to - literally - burst.  Easy for a professional bum to say all this though... right? As I said at the start, I hope my belief that money is not everything holds even after I enter the working world.   urlLink Is chasing after money good or bad? - The Straits Times, Forum Page, FEB 5, 2004   (Start of copied text) ---------- I APPLAUD Mr Paul Stefansson for dispensing very wise advice at the start of a new year in his letter, 'Money, money, it's a rich man's woe' (ST, Jan 31).  After the momentous events of the past few years, one has to realise that, at the end of the day, there is more to life than chasing money.  While my peers and my husband's moved from Housing Board flats to condos, we remained in our HDB flat. While our friends moved on to own cars, we stuck with the efficient public-transport system.  We are living on a single income for the fourth year so that our son can have a full-time mum to look after him, and imbibe our values.  While we live simply, we have created opportunities for our child to see the world, to realise that there is so much more outside this island. There are flowers to pick, open fields to run in, birds to chase; on the other hand, there are also hungry people and not all children are playing, some are working.  At the end of the day, we have to ask ourselves, what do we really want?  SHIRLEY WOON LI LIN (MDM) ---------- (End of copied text)",26,male

345,"Who is Tinku ?  We moved recently to a new place to reduce the insane commute times to office. And we landed up at what we thought was a nice apartment complex.   As we settled down and got introduced to neighbours and all, who do I see but this 12 year old kid by the name Tinku calling me 'Uncle'. I took an immediate dislike to him, though I not sure why.  Now he barges into our home whenever he feels like it, shouting 'Uncle' in a shrill voice to tell me about some new thing that he has learnt. I think the fact that my mother gives him something or the other to eat whenever he comes is encouraging him even more.  Now coming to the interesting part - he is hardly the size of my computer table but he already knows the difference between DDR Ram and SD Ram, has his own computer, knows a couple of scripting languages - python and ruby and constantly embarasses me with questions about them.  I decide that he is too young for stuff like this and tell his mother that this is the age to play and it is likely that he will have all kinds of problems in his later years if he does not stop all this immediately.  Instead of taking it in the right spirit, she told me that I should learn more if I can't answer his questions instead of asking him to stop learning.

We had a hilarious time laughing about our nilagang-baboy adventures. I told him about my aversion to nilagang baboy, ever since that incident in the St. Peter cafeteria.

He then pointed her to the direction of PGH tapos sinamahan na rin niya patawid.  Now, to get to PGH from the Supreme Court, there's a short cut where you go through the Dent driveway. When they got there, medyo whooosh! Milky and clear fluid plus blood hit the ground. Reminds of that scene in Sex and The City where Miranda broke her bag, spilling fluid on Carrie's Christian Louboutins. Nataranta si Doc Danny so he left the woman by the guard house to call for help.  Maya-maya, yung vendor sa labas nagpahiram ng monoblock chair. Patients in the Dent lobby, a lot without teeth, became instant midwives. She gave birth right then and there. Somebody lent a surprisingly clean towel. Med students arrived.

I got up pretty early today, around 6:30am. I really loathe getting up early. It's anathema to me, you could say. Particularly because that's supposed to be one of the perks of the student lifestyle, right? Ability to set own schedule, thereby avoiding the false necessity of the daily grind (the whole evasion-of-real-world-responsibilities- -in-guise-of-ongoing-search-for-enlightenment thing that's supposedly everyone's real reason for going to grad school).  So I got up early today, to go to early morning outdoor yoga. One of the instructors of the Yoga Club (of which I am a part-time member) is holding extra sessions out by the Point. That's where Hyde Park juts into the lake. A very pretty area, with trees and a grassy little field and rocky ledges from which to watch the surf. The contrast of views is interesting: look north, and you can see skyscrapers, the famous Chicago skyline. Look south, and it's much flatter, less affluent, and way more industrial, culminating in one of those nondescript (to me) factories that's constantly pumping out vaguely toxic-looking smoke (cf. White Noise, which you should be reading now instead of this). But anyway, literary pretensions and Chicago's social geography aside, the Point is just a really nice place to be outside in the summer. Seemed worth getting up for.  Malevolent clouds in the sky from the moment I wake up. Still, I hadn't heard that class was cancelled or anything, so I started walking over, hoping for the best. It starts drizzling a little about halfway there, but I soldier on. Why, after months in Chicago, this seemed like a rational course of action, I do not know. And of course, like a block and a half away from destination, it starts raining really hard. I turn back, getting pretty wet. Needlessly wet, since I've got an umbrella but, inexplicably, I choose never to take it with me anywhere. I get to the apartment. Rain stops a minute later.  Not to squeeze too much semantic juice out of this, of course. Rain probably doesn't care all that much, whatever I do. Unless I'm building some kind of diabolical weather control machine or something. But they don't let you do that until after you pass your orals. And anyway, yoga in the mud and cold doesn't sound all that appealing.  Next early morning session is this Thursday. Forecast calls for scattered thunderstorms. Whatever. What with all the paper-writing I'm supposed to be doing this summer, I'm determined to be outside whenever possible. Maybe I'll bring my umbrella this time.

Just to recap when watching over my neighbor's house (which my boss lives in) I had to feed the family fish that they had for 3 years and it dies on me (see blog post from June 30th)  This week I was asked by another neighbor to water the flowers (not a problem, it rained every day they were gone), bring in the mail and put it in the box in the garage (the garage back door would be opened). PROBLEM. I forgot to get the mail for about 3 days, then when I did get it, I went to put it in the box like I was told to, the garage door was looked, so I took it home. Then I was asked to take the garbage down on Thursday morning, not a problem. That is until I discovered that the garbage cans were not outside like at my house, but in the garage, where the door was locked. So I decided to try the door one more time, it worked, and the garbage was taken out, and the mail put in it's proper spot.  This is the grand daddy of them all and it's at my own house, so regardless I wasn't house sitting, but I am the only one home until Sunday. So I decided that I was going to be productive last night when I got home from work and clean my room, and do some laundry. Everything was going great, just chillin by myself and what not. Then I went to take my dried dark clothes out of the dryer and switch the lights into the dryer. When I walked into the hallway, I noticed the rug was all wet, then when I opened the laundry room door, there it was, a huge flood, up to my ankles. A sock from teh darks clogged up the sink drain where the washer drains out to. So there it was, water everywhere, everything was soaked. It was awful. I cleaned it all up, but what a mess.

Well, if you've ever been with my daughter, you'll know where he got that from - The Girl just doesn't shut up... ever.  She can sing for two hours straight and will expect you to listen to every word.  It gets pretty old after awhile.    So, here I am in the car with The Boy and he sings the softest, least annunciated version of the A,B,C's... it was perfect.  Every single letter was there and he even trailed off the ""...won't you come and play with me"".  I looked at him through the rear view mirror and he gave me that big smile of his and said ""again... you sing it with me"".    Ya' know, I really like talking to my kids in the car because some days I don't get much better than that... and that singing will only really get old if they stop singing to me.",36,male

365,"[ the reason why some pictures here aren't loading... ]  gate.polarhome.com is down. Main HDD in gate.polarhome.com died. It contined the whole www.polarhome.com plus five months backup from all member server. Server will be recovered, but there are some damages that can not be repared.  Please note, that 12 member servers as redhat, debian, AIX, VAX etc, are not affected with this crash. They will continue to operate as usual, but some services will not be available imediately.  Q: How can such things happen to polarhome.com A: First: polarhome can not appreciate a real backup system that could satisfy polarhome current needs (about 60G compressed) therefore one HDD had been used for such purpose. Second: polarhome operates on home equipment that can not survive more than 4 years in such work environment. First died Ultrix box, then RedHat's HDD, then FreeBSD's, now gate's... which one is next? It is running out of control. There are too many users and to high expectations towards polarhome. But it will not change the reality. polarhome.com is not a professional system and everybody have to be aware of it... and on non professional eqipment shit happens more often. :(",24,male
366,"Okay, I do not want to turn this into anything, so if anyone responds to this, please do not use any harsh language towards Relevant or any member of that community.  The other day someone posted a thread talking about wanting to leave Relevant for a while to get away from people who are critical and rude and negative about other people’s posts. Then someone else responded to this leaving by pointing the finger at other people, blaming the ""nOObs"" (which he later edited) and later blaming me (which I have found to be a misunderstanding in the first place). I pointed out that it was post like this that were the very cause of people leaving Relevant, posts in which new people are made fun of and people act in a negative manner towards each other. Then I was blamed. I decided to take a break to let myself cool down as to not say anything I would regret. I came back today to read some posts (not post) and found myself banned. In my confusion I IMed one of the mods or admins (doesn’t matter who). I was told that I was a ""problem child"" and that they were ""taking care of the problem"". I am very sad about this because I love Relevant and the people on those boards, they all mean a lot to me. If anyone really was offended by any of my posts I am very sorry, it was never my intention.

368,"OK, rescheduling again, this time because of dear old  urlLink TechEdge . So, we have two tentative dates now, which are  Thursday the 5th and Friday the 6th (same time : 1.30pm) . I would like comments from the people who want to attend so that we can decide on the most favourable date.  A recap for those who haven't read about  urlLink Sessions@Exun  or more specifically  urlLink PHP . The idea of Sessions@Exun was conceived so that interested people may learn a specific skill in computers from people who have already learnt that skill and are experienced in it. This helps because reading big, fat books is tedious and sometimes if the book is technical, then confusing as well. Teachers are always better than books anyway.  More specifically  PHP  ( P HP:  H ypertext  P reprocessor) is an HTML-embedded scripting language, which means that it is used for serving dynamic content on web pages, just like ASP. The only difference (usage-wise) between ASP and PHP is that ASP is a Microsoft product and needs a Windows Server to run on while PHP is Open Source and can run on any OS. And since Linux is being more widely deployed these days, it makes more sense to learn PHP if you're doing Server-Side Scripting. I am told that PHP is tougher than ASP, but since I have no knowledge of PHP (I'm counting on this Session myself), I can't say anything about that.   About  Mukul : Many people have asked me who Mukul is, so let me introduce him. Mukul is an Exun alumnus, currently studying at Iowa State University (US). He is here in Delhi for his summer break and has found time to give us an introduction to PHP, which he says is his mother tongue.  Please comment away people. We want to know who's coming and what day is more favourable - Thursday or Friday.  --Karan  PS: Any student of DPS RK Puram can attend, not just Exun members.",15,male
369,"Ok, so today's Valentine's Day. Big whoop. I have never had a Valentine in my life, and I doubt I'm gonna be starting now. Is that pathetic when a senior in high school has never had a girlfriend even though he is the most handsome guy in the world? Yeah, I know; how  was  that possible for Brad Pitt not to have a girlfriend?   But back to me. I think Pam is my Valentine. She never actually  accepted  the invitation, but she wrote about it in her blog, which is phenomenal, because I am NEVER in there, but have only recently received the honor. So, in short, Pam and I are Valentines today.  Just something cool I found:   JJbaby9:  Girls are like apples on trees. The best ones are at the top of the tree. The boys don't want to reach for the good ones because they are afraid of falling and getting hurt. Instead, they just get the rotten apples that are on the ground that aren't as good, but easy. So the apples at the top think something is wrong with them, when in reality, they are amazing. They just have to wait for the right boy to come along, the one who's brave enough to climb all the way to the top of the tree.  xuan 578:  most girls on the tops of apple trees are chemically enhanced apples, made really beautiful on the outside and bad tasting on the inside... that's why the good guys just eat watermelons, that way you can spit out the bad seeds  I've done a lot of thinking recently, and I have come to this conclusion: I am in exactly the same position as when I started thinking.  There was something I was about to put in here, but I forgot what it was. Dang it.  Who's Megan?  No Galveston trip today; the weather was too bad. That sucks because it would have been one helluva good time. My CC friends always make me have fun... I wish I had gone to Denny's with them Thursday night, because it was certainly unproductive to go Valentine's shopping for someone who doesn't even care.  However, Jenn liked her rose, so huzzah! Jennifer Elkin is one of my new all-time favorite people. She's way cool, and she makes me feel good. Not just in general, but also about myself; she's a real self-esteem booster. And that is a quality lacking in many people I know. And I enjoy squirrels.  Now I remember what it was I was gonna put: POST IN MY FORUM. Just click the link at the top of the page and do your thang. It has been severely lacking in sustenance (posts) for too long.

371,"A TvNewsLIES Reader contribution.By John Gray Cincinnati, Ohio -  urlLink jgray7@cinci.rr.com  - July - 2004  Printable version:  urlLink Click here!   Joe gets up at 6:00am to prepare his morning coffee. He fills his pot full of good clean drinking water because some liberal fought for minimum water quality standards. He takes his daily medication with his first swallow of coffee. His medications are safe to take because some liberal fought to insure their safety and work as advertised.  All but $10.00 of his medications are paid for by his employers medical plan because some liberal union workers fought their employers for paid medical insurance, now Joe gets it too. He prepares his morning breakfast, bacon and eggs this day. Joe’s bacon is safe to eat because some liberal fought for laws to regulate the meat packing industry.  Joe takes his morning shower reaching for his shampoo; His bottle is properly labeled with every ingredient and the amount of its contents because some liberal fought for his right to know what he was putting on his body and how much it contained. Joe dresses, walks outside and takes a deep breath. The air he breathes is clean because some tree hugging liberal fought for laws to stop industries from polluting our air. He walks to the subway station for his government subsidized ride to work; it saves him considerable money in parking and transportation fees. You see, some liberal fought for affordable public transportation, which gives everyone the opportunity to be a contributor.  Joe begins his work day; he has a good job with excellent pay, medicals benefits, retirement, paid holidays and vacation because some liberal union members fought and died for these working standards. Joe’s employer pays these standards because Joe’s employer doesn’t want his employees to call the union. If Joe is hurt on the job or becomes unemployed he’ll get a worker compensation or unemployment check because some liberal didn’t think he should loose his home because of his temporary misfortune.  Its noon time, Joe needs to make a Bank Deposit so he can pay some bills. Joe’s deposit is federally insured by the FSLIC because some liberal wanted to protect Joe’s money from unscrupulous bankers who ruined the banking system before the depression.  Joe has to pay his Fannie Mae underwritten Mortgage and his below market federal student loan because some stupid liberal decided that Joe and the government would be better off if he was educated and earned more money over his life-time.  Joe is home from work, he plans to visit his father this evening at his farm home in the country. He gets in his car for the drive to dads; his car is among the safest in the world because some liberal fought for car safety standards. He arrives at his boyhood home. He was the third generation to live in the house financed by Farmers Home Administration because bankers didn’t want to make rural loans. The house didn’t have electric until some big government liberal stuck his nose where it didn’t belong and demanded rural electrification. (Those rural Republican’s would still be sitting in the dark)  He is happy to see his dad who is now retired. His dad lives on Social Security and his union pension because some liberal made sure he could take care of himself so Joe wouldn’t have to. After his visit with dad he gets back in his car for the ride home.He turns on a radio talk show, the host’s keeps saying that liberals are bad and conservatives are good. (He doesn’t tell Joe that his beloved Republicans have fought against every protection and benefit Joe enjoys throughout his day) Joe agrees, “We don’t need those big government liberals ruining our lives; after all, I’m a self made man who believes everyone should take care of themselves, just like I have”.",43,male

Immaculate Heart of Mary Church in Marshall, an Eskimo village of about 360 people, has been abuzz since the Easter Vigil, when a group of parishioners say the church's main crucifix began to bleed from the feet, hands and side.   Anna Polty, 73, claims she saw something happening to the crucifix during the April 10 Easter Vigil. And after the vigil, when the parishioners were downstairs having a snack, Polty's friend, Sophie Shorty, whispered in her ear that the crucifix was starting to bleed. Both women went back upstairs to see.

378,"No decision is completely arbitrary. Roll a die, pick a card – some unarticulated motive will affect the outcome. Nothing is pure chance.   At the start of each day, you make a choice. And you have to live with it. You’ve learned how to navigate your top drawer and the silks and cottons it holds, but getting her has been a process. In the beginning, you had no say - someone else put them on and took them off. But then underwear became perhaps the first sartorial choice in your life. Your inner child knows that the skivvies you put on are intimately connected to who you are, hence the wailing echo of “I wanna wear my Underoooos!” Outside, you were just another goofy three-year old. Inside, you were Aquaman.  The change from Justice League to snug and silky is subtle; underwear evolution comes without color commentary. But each year, your natural selections take on greater import. It’s a complicated cocktail of mood and intentions, choosing underwear is: an expression of how you forecast the day ahead, your expectations and hopes, maybe eve your dreams.  Your underwear sends a signal. But it also transmits a message inward, whether you want to receive it or not. Like on those days when you catch yourself lingering just a little too long at the top drawer as you mentally fast-forward to the shank of the evening.  No! you say, that has nothing to with it , claiming mom and paramedics as you select. But as you anxiously gulp one more beer with your best friend’s recent ex and your silky blues struggle to readjust themselves, you know that something that was not supposed to be there is. It’s taunting you, flaunting you; it’s got you under its skin. At the end of the day, you can’t hide who you are. Or what you want. Your underwear does not lie.",24,male

389,"David Miller   It's been a couple of weeks since I have been to  urlLink his site , but David Miller has redesigned, and generally improved his mayoral website.  I hope that his  urlLink Policies and Issues  section will grow over the course of the campaign.  Miller is clearly the ""TTC candidate"", and I think he'll be recognized for that.  I just hope that he doesn't pigeon-hole his campaign to that issue alone.  He's got 3 councillors who support him directly (Bussin, Johnston, and Pantalone), and a few others who have written letters of  urlLink recommendation  and support.  Most notably, famed  urlLink urban planning  theorist  urlLink Jane Jacobs  who writes:   Jane Jacobs  Letter to supporters January 2003  I'm working for David Miller because I believe this is the most crucial election in Toronto's recent history. Left and right stereotypes are irrelevant because David understands that, as he says, ""the city can't work socially unless it works economically"". What he has already accomplished tells us how much David can achieve in the years ahead:  - David Miller fought for the public inquiry we now have into the scandalous MFP computer leasing deal.  - David Miller is a leader in the campaign against the Island bridge and expanded airport, which will destroy this City's waterfront heritage.  - When TTC fares were raised, David Miller came up with a plan for companies, hospitals, and schools to get cheaper rates when they buy TTC passes in bulk.   The time has come for new ideas, a new way of conducting business, even for a new generation of politicians. I support David Miller wholeheartedly and with great personal enthusiasm. I believe he is the only person with a coherent vision of Toronto's future, with the ability to do what needs to be done, and the energy and will to do it.",27,male

391,"As most of you people from school know, I am very sick. Or rather, I FEEL rather sick.  I'm sorry to have whined about it in school, but I was in pain.  When I got home ( at 3:15... stupid bus didn't show up so had to wait something like an hour and a half for dad to get me... then we went into town... ARRG! ONe plus is that we got Tommy out from the library, so tonight I am going to be enjoying the best rock opera in existance, and also watching the Flying Circus!  ( It's..... XP )  So maybe getting sick wasn't so bad.  The only bad thing is that I took a nap, and woke up at five.  I had part of my sick dream  ( the dream I always have when I'm dizzy ) and it was about the world being distroyed.  I am really shaken up right now, I need someone to talk to to get my mind off this subject.  Benedict, why do we keep missing eachother online?  We have a five day weekend ( starting today..tomarrow..whatever. We go back on Wensday)  so hopefully we can talk sometime in that little window of freeness.

397,"If I came back in 1,000 years, I'll find the same people, espousing the same positions, glumly tossing the same evidence at one another. No, I'm not talking about the Bush-Kerry election. I'm talking about the American Civil War. Every now and then I check back in on my friends in that community, and I find them as immortal and immovable as the poker-playing dogs in those cheap prints, or the Seven Sleepers in the New Testament, waiting it out till the end of the world.  The anti-Confederates mine the history books for quotes from the leading (or not so leading) figures of the South, and crow when they find one who says he understood the war was ""all about slavery.""  Yet what any one person in a movement gives as his reasons, if he speaks candidly, can only be his own reasons, unless there is some transcendant uniformity of thought or mind-control in effect. Even a quick survey of the old South turns up such a cacophany of rivalries, quarrels, and feuds it would be nothing short of miraculous if, though they all took the same step, they did it for precisely the same reasons.  Just look at current events. America is at war again today. What are the ""reasons"" we attacked Iraq? Revenge for Saddam's insults to Bush I? Unfinished business from the first Gulf War? Blood for oil? The risk of a rich despot with a determination to get WMD in a post 9-11 world? Freedom for Iraqi people? Planting democracy in the Mideast? Enforcing U.N. resolutions? Intimidating other rogue states?  If you argue that it is ONLY, EXCLUSIVELY about one of those things, you're nuts. The voices on one side are as diverse as Christopher Hitchens and Pat Robertson and Jose Ramos-Horta and Tony Blair and Dick Cheney. Can you really devise a one-sentence reason that covers all those minds (and me, too).  I should add, to the anti-anti-war list, the delightful ""Muslim refusenik"" Canadian feminist lesbian  urlLink  Irshad Manji  .  Here's how she dismantles one detractor on her Web site:    “You remind me of Afro-Americans like [Supreme Court justice] Clarence Thomas, [national security advisor] Condaleezza Rice, [Congressman] J.C. Watt and [Secretary of State] Colin Powell, who sold out their Afro-American credentials to the Republican Party to gain affirmative action appointments.” - Tanzila    Irshad replies:  Afro-American ""credentials”? Honey, that’s so 1980s. Please join the 21st century and think about this: Why should skin color dictate thought pattern? Isn’t it racist to assume it should? And why do you automatically reduce these individuals to ‘affirmative action appointments,’ neglecting that Watts fought and won an election or that Rice was provost at Stanford? I’ll need some thoughtful answers before I can be shamed into believing that I’ve ‘sold out’ my Muslim credentials. Meanwhile, don’t forget to forward your ideological clock to 2004.",44,male
398,"The place to be during today's flash flood warning time period (6:30 to 8:45pm) was on the covered patio at  urlLink Cup A Joe , Mission Valley.  Despite my truly awful Thai iced tea ( urlLink Cafe Cyclo  has a decent one, but Raleigh is clueless about all things Thai), and the conversation blocking rain-on-metal-roof noise, it was possible to have an engaging conversation with an outgoing stranger while watching the storm.    The weather is so exciting, here.  It's loud and inconvenient instead of merely damp.  In fact, we don't have weather in Oregon most of the time; We have damp.  Anyway, the conversation was interesting.  He guessed that I'm vegetarian - is it that obvious? - shared that he has faith, and then asked me what I believe.  I was taken aback, since a) my beliefs are too complicated to spell out in one paragraph let alone to someone I just met and b) no one asks this outside of church.  Except it wasn't that kind of situation.  He was curious what I believed.  So after I said, ""That's a rather personal question, isn't it?"" I told him that I have faith, although different than most peoples', and I choose to show it through action rather than vocalizing it.  Sometime later we got on the subject of schizophrenia.  He could see that I was okay with talking about mental illness so he was comfortable telling me that he's a schizophenic.  This surprised him because it isn't something you tell a lot of people even if you're on your meds and doing well, like he is.  So I told him that D. has it.  We talked about how terrifying the disease is for everyone involved.  He said to be careful not to get too stressed out, or take drugs, and to stay healthy to avoid triggering it.  (I could develop it into my early 40's but I doubt that I'm high risk.)    Of course, this makes me wonder if I'm being ridiculous about the D. situation.  Is it time for me to make peace with the Boogey Man?  He is going to die soon, right?  How much of his obnoxiousness is the illness and how much is just him?  He's a manipulative bastard, but should I continue to cut him out of my life completely?  That's not very nice, is it?",25,female
399,"for no apparent reason, today i was thinking about the pain we all carry.    i pictured the faces before me from my husband, family members, and a trail of friends, and with each their pain seemed suddenly vivid -- nearly a color or image. then thoughts went to acquaintances who i've often been surprised to find what they've carried, or the many hastily resown hearts.  we've no idea what each other has inside.  such scars and unhealed wounds. they can't be compared to each other, each individual's experience comes in different weights.  i considered my own too and wondered how we all do it.  how do we get up sometimes?  later, i stopped by the traveling viet nam wall with my oldest son and daughter and my niece.  yes, ""stopped by"" which felt rather disrespectful.  my father was in viet nam when i was born, and i wished to know the names he could recognize there.  we watched a man trace the name of someone he knew.  i read wishing to speak each one aloud and know them for a moment.  what enormity of pain in each one.        another matchbox twenty quote (oh, that rob thomas), ""there's no one around who can tell us what we're here for.""  such could be a quest of mine, to know why we're here.  i mean really.  my need for christ is part of that quest, but all the old answers don't work for me (such as, ""to go out and share christ.""  yeah, that's worked great, so all this pain has been well worth it).  robert benson writes something of this in  between the dreaming and the coming true . this from memory and my own thoughts too...but,   can we see or experience light without having been in the dark?   could we know joy without some sorrow?   is beauty beautiful because of the ugly to contrast?   for us to love must we also feel pain, even the pain of love?   is the loneliness required to someday feel complete?   and must we be separated from god to truly discover him or to need him or yearn for him or recognize our need and want of him?    somehow among these, i feel it connects with a required divine sacrifice for human redemption.      wonder if robert benson has a blog?  i'd be stopping by if so; his books amaze me.    anyway, i'm much more philosophical silly-putty than any kind of theologian.  maybe sleep will bring something more, lately sleep's been overflowing with dreams.  some scary, others painful.  so i'm tossing thoughts to see what returns.",34,female

Jennifer has a nice car, and the front was bent up a little bit, so she got freaked out, but never the less the fact that Jennifer and I both got out without any injuries is the biggest part.

404,"PROTESTING THE PROTEST   Initially, I decided to leave Mr Sexton's  urlLink account of the Sproul protest  alone, mostly because spring break came along, love was in the air, and I was spending too much energy being happy about this:     (if you don't want to hear him, tell him to make bad movies . . . you know, like bo derek and shannen doherty do)  Anyway... as I said, I had planned to leave it alone, but Mr Engberg's "" urlLink news analysis "" came along after Sexton's, so it's time to have some fun.  One of the implications here seems to be that the anti-war movement (in Berkeley or wherever else, it isn't clear after a while, there is a part-for-the-whole implication on Engberg's part here) is being anti-troops.  First of all, any rational thinker, not to mention rational observers of the anti-war movement in action (whether direct at a street corner, or through a lit candle) can tell you that opposing the war and administration policy are thoroughly different from non-support of the troops.  Engberg doesn't draw on any specific evidence regarding non-support, other than ""ranting"" and ""raving"" by speakers from the rally.  (where's the, um, ""analysis""?)  Attempting to give him as much benefit of the doubt as possible, perhaps he is referring to the yellow-ribbon episode described in Sexton's earlier piece: Surrounded by the peace activists, members of the Berkeley College Republicans distributed yellow ribbons as a symbol of support for the U.S. troops. They were able to hand some off to opponents of the war, while others of the protesters jeered and derided the troops. Some anti-war activists took the yellow ribbons, threw them on the ground and stomped on them repeatedly. Others took the basket filled with the ribbons and hurled it across the plaza, causing many of the small yellow ribbons to fall to the plaza ground. Is it within the realm of possibility that the actions taken against the ribbons by some at the protest may have been a response to what amounted to an attempt by the BCR's to look for trouble and create a scene, all while cynically using our men and women in Iraq as pawns for their politics?  Part of supporting the troops is trying to get them home as soon as possible; they're not the ones who dragged us into this foreign policy debacle.  Quoting a Republican freshman doesn't reinforce the argument any further.  A longer discussion could center around the idea that the campus protest movement is a bit iconoclastic when it comes to ""patriotic"" symbols like flags and yellow ribbons.  But anti-symbol doesn't necessarily mean anti-patriotic.  Perhaps, also, a realization of the worldwide implications of our current action in Iraq renders the protest movement bigger than just an issue of American patriotism.  This idea is certainly relevant to the situation in Berkeley surrounding the 9/11 anniversary several months ago.  Ooh, speaking of 9/11, from Engberg's final 'graf, on how we should all join hands, sing songs and support the war gleefully, says: ...Remember the three-week bipartisan lovefest we experienced after 9/11? Why did it occur? It occurred because abnormal times mandated a deviation from normalcy. Under normal circumstances, our nation is divided strictly along partisan lines. We often forget that we are Americans. Now, however, the time has come to remember once again that we are not identified by the party we vote for, but by the country we live in... Engberg seems unable to understand how we could unite after 9/11 but not after this war starts.  What's the difference between 9/11 and the Iraq war?  We united after 9/11 because  we were attacked !  We were not attacked by Iraq, we have never been attacked by Iraq, and no evidence exists showing Iraq to be an imminent threat to our security!  (just yesterday, the discovery of white powder - gasp! - turned out to be, well,  urlLink explosives , again not our promised WMD)  There are many other reasons why there is not unity behind this war, but that one seems to stick out the most.  Oh, and  urlLink this too .

408,"My life is in constant motion. Falling away, and the next moment coming back together. Then fall away again...like air particles moving at high speeds in random motions. And right now, I just feel that I'm losing control of my own life. But that's no problem, cause most of the time I would be able to gather it back. But there are just certain things I wish to address.  As many who know me would know that I just camp back from the Youth Retreat. And to be honest, despite the many changed lives and people, and people who thoroughly enjoyed and learned from the camp, my experience was a totally different one. It was probably one of the worst camps I've ever been to. Not in terms of planning or the work done by the commitee, but rather my role during the camp as group leader, and the discouragement I get so often.  It started out with that terribly barren population of my group (this is no offence to my ex-group members), which already removed half my heart for excitement during the camp. Then the next day, I got really fed up, cause it's so hard to be a friend to people and at the same time a group leader. I was angry with people, but more with myself. And all the 'like here like there' thingy (my sister refers to it this way) really destroys my day. To be honest, I think that adolescent 'love' is probably pure infatuation and selfish foolishness, I know that by saying this, I offended like 99.99% of my close friends (that's if I ever had any), but I don't care, cause that's what I think. I'm not talking this in a bias viewpoint. In fact, I didn't say this because I just had a rejection from someone I really 'like', but instead, it's quite the opposite.  I shall now officially leave the topic of camp. And now, I have a confession to make. A big one. One that's probably an invitation to a one to one personal time with almost everyone who reads this entry. Here goes...For this past year, I've had two mutual crushes. Don't mind me using the word. I don't believe in adolescent 'love' anymore, although I should have thought better than to believe in something so 'fairy tale' in the first place. One lasted  10 months and another a week. And just a moment ago, I felt terrible and guilty and was faced with the: 'She needs you more from both people.' You know, at this point of time, you just want the whole world to tell you that you're a sinful scumbag who is heartless and deserves all condemnation possible. That would have made me feel better. Instead, every single person I talked to said I did the right thing and at least I was honest and all. Oh...brother... But now, I've made up my mind and I'm telling myself that I'm never going to like another girl (I'll just perish all thoughts concerning anything like it) for 5 years. That'll help. It's not that hard after having made the same mistake with two different people. Disclaimer: This two people are great people, but my heart is now hardened and I shall not let them take any romantic position in my life which I feel is hardly possible even if I allow them to, since adolescent 'love' is just a lie that you want to spend the rest of your life with someone. *quote*love or not love, true love, such a thing is too early to be possible for us.*unquote*  I don't understand why people fall out with people. You know, like why can't the whole world be friends? I know the problem is sin. But everyone things that it's the other person. Partly, I mean totally, that's due to sin too. But people just tend to be selfish, don't they? I often feel that the young people (around my age) are separated into two factions. There's a group that is the 'in' group. Supposedly better looking and the more well dressed and fun people to be with, and the more quiet, if not less popular people that only just want to have friends. (forgive me...) This are just my thoughts, nobody said they are or were true. Ok...this is out of point. I think I just wanna express my unhappines.  I was at the Music Camp Concert on Sunday night. And looking at the kids, I realised that innocence is so precious, and is something that should be well treasure. With innocence, all you want is fun and be happy. As someone said, 'You just like this person *full stop*' 'Love' would be ten times more fun, and also, in case of self conciousness, it is practically non-existent. I mean I went just where a Batman costume and walk about the street without worry about being laughed at if only I still there much of innocence. It'll be silly to say that I am not innocent at all, cause if you say that you are, you're probably too innocent. But I do feel that I'm innocent, but still not enough to be the inner child inside of me, which I would like to deny that is 16 years old.  Ok...last of all. I still love God and He has control over my life. After all this, all the more so. I've sort out my thoughts, my life is God, that's my decision. Soli Deo Gloria!",16,male

415,"William Safire on the 9/11 Commission   Pity the great writer on politics and language  William Safire .  Why ? Well, aside from being a Pulitzer Prize winning former Nixon speechwriter and Senior columnist for the  Old Gray Lady , he has a lot of new words to digest and interpret for his  On Language  column in the  Sunday Magazine . These 9/11 hearings have given us all pause, what with their codewords spiralling out into the light of day.  I wonder how  urlLink Bill  would analyze the 9/11 hearings of yesterday?  Hmmm (dreamy fade away):   Actionable Intelligence   What is  urlLink actionable intelligence ? And when, more precisely, is intelligence actionable?  In response to questioning from the 9/11 commission on Tuesday, Secretary of Defense  Donald  ""The Jockstrap""  Rumsfeld  said, ""First, I know of no  actionable intelligence  since January 20, 2001 that would have allowed the U.S. to attack and capture or kill  Usama bin Laden .""  But in this matter we will give the last word to DC  urlLink doyenne   Sally Quinn , who is used to such gallant favors:  Washington DC is a matriarchal society and I am the queen bee. Any incoming administration would be ill advised to get on my bad side early in the game. Ask  urlLink Bill Clinton  about that point sometime.  Anyway , I received some action able intelligence  via the Hill some time ago that  urlLink Arianna Huffington  coveted my social position. Well, I don't like to kiss and tell, but let's just say Arianna was last seen dropping out of the California recall debacle and  urlLink producing telemovies . She'll never eat lunch in this town again. Draw your own conclusions.                                                                                         Sally Quinn,                                                                                        Washington DC   The Washington Read   ""I have not read the book, "" is not the sentence that the President utters most often, although, no doubt, he probably does. ""I have not read the book,""  is the answer that many under questioning from the 9/11 Commission offer up.   And what is the book in question? Why: It's  urlLink Richard Clarke's   urlLink Against All Enemies .  Everyone it seems used plausible denial when asked whether or not they had read the book in question. Only one respondent admitted to ""the Washington read,"" which entails scanning the index to see if anything is said about you.   This reminds me of an incident between  urlLink Norman Mailer and William F. Buckley :  "" William F. Buckley  once sent fellow author  Norman Mailer  a copy of his latest book. Mailer, disappointed to find that Buckley had apparently neglected to inscribe the book, promptly flipped through the index to see whether he had been mentioned. There, beside his name, Mailer found Buckley's 'inscription' - a handwritten 'Hi!'""   The adjectival Talmudic   Let's get our "" urlLink boots on the ground "" and try to discover the use of  urlLink Talmudic  as an adjective by the 9/11 Commission.   urlLink The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage  by  Allan Siegal  and  William G. Connolly  says of Talmud, ""The overall term (literally study) for the body of Jewish oral law and tradition.""   But what they don't mention is that studying the Talmud is thirsty work. Influential conservative philosopher  Leo Strauss  made many innovations in the study of ancient philosophical texts through his intimate knowledge the Talmud (Strauss was a rabinnical student) You won't see  President Bush  in the near future poring over the Talmud in the West Wing, deep in thought. And so, with that improbably image in mind, any text too complicated for Dubya will hereafter be called  Talmudic .   Thank You For Your Candor    After testimony is given the commissioners tell those who have just testified, ""Thank you for your candor."" Where did this originate?  Candor, of course, is derivative from the ancient Kryptonian city of  urlLink Kand-or.   ""Kandor is ... harbored in the  Fortress of Solitude  until Superman can one day find a way to free the people from their dimensional prison. Until that day, Cerizah and the people of Kandor will feel safe knowing Superman is looking out for their well being.""",33,male

417,"Well, I did promise some more stuff for today, and here it is: Having watched ER (as in, the American hospital drama, created my Michael Crichton, among others) for some time, I've begun to notice some trends within the program - it appears that the parallel universe in which the series is set (for it must be an alternate reality; where else would a slight upon a patient ensue in a vengeful tank rampage?) is controlled by a malevolent right-wing deity, determined to impose its values on a rather liberal cast of character. This manifests itself mainly in the punishment by ""acts of God"" of those who transgress against a rather reactionary unspoken moral code. (as an aside, I want to point out that the comments below in no way represent my opinion, rather the apparent beliefs of the writers of the series.) For example, in the last series alone, Dr. Carey was punished for her lesbianism, and, more topically, her marriage to her partner, by the death of said partner (a heroic firewoman, probably ""lead astray"" at some point), and the virtual abduction of their child by her wife's unsympathetic family. Dr Carter, an otherwise ""blameless"" character; clearly Aryan and fresh-faced (and a multi-millionaire to boot), makes the mistake of falling in love with not only a black woman, but one who does not endorse the US' medical policies abroad with regard to AIDS in Africa. Moreover, she has a clearly European/British accent and is uncomfortably independent of the good doctor. To cut a convoluted plotline short, she eventually falls pregnant by Varter, but the pregnancy results in a miscarriage, in what seems like a punishment for so-called ""miscegenation"". There may seem to be little point to my rantings on this subject, but in my (admittedly warped) mind it strikes me as a rather worrying subliminal encroachment of neoconservative values in popular culture - often an excellent indicator of political climate, especially in high-profile U.S. television dramas.

Maybe Schlitterbahn on Friday, when I grab my emergency cash loan that will sate me until the loan fundage comes in.

420,"June 3, 2004 - We applaud the pastoral sensitivity of Bishops Jon Bruno and John Chane in choosing to both authorize and preside at the blessing of unions of same-sex couples in their dioceses. We believe such celebrations of holy love give glory to God and are examples to us all, and we give thanks for the witness and ministry of the bishops presiding and the couples committing themselves to Christ and to each other.  We reject the American Anglican Council's characterization of the actions of the bishops of Los Angeles and Washington as ""unilateral,"" noting that such blessings are in accord with the actions of the majority of the duly elected representatives of the mainstream Episcopal church meeting in its General Convention.  Since that General Convention in 2003, the Episcopal Church has faced the challenge of an unprecedented assault on its unity by the leadership of an American Anglican Council committed to a course of polarization and division. We are deeply saddened that their continued refusal to engage in reconciliation-focused dialogue with those with whom they disagree has lead to the current state of affairs. We re-state our assertion that responsibility for any looming schism lays firmly at the feet of the leadership of the AAC who have rebuffed every effort to mediate the differences between us, forsaking the historic via media for a theological absolutism antithetical to traditional Anglicanism.  As the Lambeth Commission strives to balance the unity and diversity that are hallmarks of classical Anglicanism we urge them to balance as well the pastoral and the prophetic. Had Rosa Parks listened only to pleas for restraint and not heeded the call for justice we might well have been spared the tumultuous challenges of the 1960Â¹s but at the cost of abandoning our baptismal call to strive for justice and to respect the dignity of every human being. We believe it is never too late to embrace the high calling of living out the good news of God in Christ Jesus made available to all people. We give thanks for the privilege of offering that witness to the world.

421,"Today was a misfortunate day for me. I started working in my blog early in the morning so that I can have a good speed internet connection( through the phone), but the internet was not working very well especially with my blog. I wanted to change its template but I could not. so at the end I put the first template I could download instead of the one I wanted.  In the evening me and my husband went to a new internet café near our house and we rented two computers. I was so happy at the beginning because everything was going as I wanted. I downloaded some lessons for Flash that helped me in web design (I started designing few web sites and I want to learn how to add animation to them). Anyway, I finally wanted to put these lessons into the flash RAM when I discovered that my computer’s Windows is 98 and not 2000 and it cannot see the flash RAM. My husband tried to copy my files to his computer because his computer’s windows is 2000 but the network did not work. Finally we asked the man in the internet cafe to bring us a disk so I can copy my files on it. I was shocked when I heard that they did not have a disk! can you imagine an internet cafe had nothing you can to take your work out from it. Any way I believed that today was my bad day and I was making my way out when the man in the internet came and refused to take the money for the rental of the two computers we had rented. We asked him to take at least one computer’s rental but he insisted not to. That was the only good news in my story. I came home and willing that tomorrow I will be able to go to another internet cafe and download what I want .",27,female
422,"Well well well, if it isn't Monday! Hilary and I spent the weekend absorbing too much alcohol which has left me listless all irritable. The only thing worse then being those things is writing a cranky blog. So I won't. What's worse then logging on to the world wide web and complaining?  Friday afternoon Hilary I spent in athletic lounge clothes sitting in the tv den of laziness. The only thing motivating us to adjurn to the table, was a dime bag with the crumbs of some weed Hilary found at gas station last month. We had stopped at a Mobile Mart on a road trip up to Worchester (7 Mash Shows). So Hilary is walking along, minding her own business when she stumbles upon this delicious little treat. What I liked 2nd most about when she found the weed, was how she only saw it because she was walking across the lot with her head down, eyes on pavement. She told us how she always finds herself walking like this, and as a result, finds many treasures. Kitty noted that indeed it is the meek who will inherit the earth.  So anyhow, Hillary and I get good and giggly from the pot, and then proceed to mix up some cocktails, with shakers and martini glasses- the whole bit! This was only killing time until the Champagne we lazily ordered from the liquor shop across the street cooled off, as I had not had the frame of mind to order it cold! Stupid Tracy.

425,"Well, I made it to London on time and I'm glad to say that my hair and makeup turned out fine in the end!   I met Dan at Paddington station just before 4.30pm (after being harassed by a stinky drunken tramp who wanted to squash on the seat next to me then pushed me aside when I stood up). My first clue to the location of my surprise was that we would be going to Green Park station. The only place I knew where that was the nearest stations was Hard Rock Cafe but I was told it wasn't there ;o)   We started off with a pint of Stella and a GT in the Reef bar to discuss the plan for the evening and eventually decided to head off towards Covent Garden. After a wander round and a glass of red wine it was time for the mystery location to be revealed.   We arrived at Green Park tube station and I saw a sign above the exit which give the game away. My birthday surprise was... Dinner at  urlLink The Ritz !   With an hour before our dinner reservation we went for a drink in  urlLink The Rivoli Bar . I ordered one of their famous ""Pre-Dinner Cocktails"", a Ritz Medley and Dan went for a Mojito.   Soon it was time for dinner in  urlLink The Restaurant  which was a fantastically stunning room.   After placing our orders we were firstly greeted by a waiter with the bread trolley on which was a basket of about 6-7 different types of bread. Bewildered and confused by all the types I stuck to the white ciabatta which was sliced in front of me and then served from a silver dish while Dan decided on the tomato and olive bread.   Next came what seemed to be an expresso but in fact was an appetizer with compliments of the chef. It was a kind of fish soup which I thought wasn't too bad (not being a lover of fish) and Dan thought was very good.   Our starters were served, mine complete with a silver dome cover! I chose the Duck served with broad beans and peas while Dan opted for the Smoked Salmon served with herb blini and creme fraiche. The half of lemon was wrapped in muslin and tied with a yellow ribbon so you didn't get any pips or anything in your dinner!   For our main meal I had Lamb Cutlets while Dan had the Sirloin Steak. Both were served with chunky chips and green beans and both were absolutely gorgeous. The meal was washed down with a very nice bottle of South African Cabernet-Sauvignon.   We couldn't refuse the desserts which were as fabulous as everything else. We both went for one from the chocolate section. Mine was a chocolate and caramel creation while Dan had a   chocolate fondant with raspberry ripple ice cream. Divine!   It was an absolutely fabulous night and if your credit card can survive the damage then I'd recommend everyone to go. We're already starting a collection to go again! ;o)   Thanks to Dan for arranging it for me, it's the best birthday surprise ever and I love you lots!   L xx",27,female

432,"urlLink  Salon's got the goods.   A great compilation of 18th birthday advice from various ""experts"" for our favorite twins.  Some excerpts follow.  They are pretty long excerpts because I was laughing so hard reading it that I almost peed my pants and I know none of you want to wade through Salon's ads to read this stuff.  Still, this is only about HALF of what the various people have to say.  My favorite is probably Janice Dickinson because all she did was talk about herself.  But Annie Sprinkle gives the best advice, I think.  Simon Doonan, creative director for Barney's New York:   A twin, as your nearest and dearest confidante, can also be a validator of dreadful obsessions. Nonstop togetherness can lead to a deranged cul-de-sac where all your darkest obsessions (bulimia, big boobs, body-cutting) are validated by each other! It's a sad fact that most celebs end up getting strange at some point, finding themselves in weird cults and whatnot, but from what I can tell, twins are worse off than most. Start hanging out with intelligent, fun, intensely charismatic people. Intimidating people. Perhaps some of that attitude will rub off on them. Why not ring up Camille Paglia, for example, and ask her to come on holiday?  Annie Sprinkle, prostitute/porn star turned sexologist, educator, multimedia artist and utopian entrepreneur:   At this stage in their lives and their careers, I think it would really benefit them to embrace masturbation, to practice reaching orgasm. They need to get comfortable with making themselves feel good on a daily basis, to help them feel prepared to face the challenges of their busy little lives. Personally, I've really come to value the orgasm experience in times of stress and strain. As they get older, the twins will probably become more and more orgasmic, but good masturbatory habits start now.  J.T. LeRoy, novelist band member and associate film producer:   The twins would have to endure a torrid event, a public disgrace, because our society has very set rules. In order to change perception about someone, we need to be seriously shaken, like an Etch A Sketch. Look at Brooke Shields -- she had to do some big fat fucking falls on her face before she could move forward in her career. Their best bet would be to simply disappear for a while. Maybe one of them could break off from the pair and take on a lesbian role (but not with the other twin!) in an edgy foreign film, a role that would really prove some acting chops.  D-Roc, from the Ying Yang Twins hip-hop duo:  Shit, I ain't never had that kind of money like them other twins have. I'm still trying to get that much. The first thing I be sayin' to them: Manage your cash properly, don't spend it all in one place. Shit. I'm still thinkin' 'bout all that money! Be yourself, girls, and the rest will follow. From what I can tell, they haven't ventured out on their own. They always be chillin' together! They gotta get their own thaaang. Keep that wholesome look, and they'll keep raking in the cash. And they should definitely stay off the drugs. Absolutely. Peace out (times two).   Janice Dickinson, judge on the UPN program ""America's Next Top Model"" and self-described ""world's first supermodel"":   I'm on a hit show, I'm gorgeous, I feel good, and I'm so grateful to be me ... but wait! We're talking about the Olsen twins here.  I'm the perfect person to give the Olsen twins advice.  My daughter absofuckinglutely loves these girls. In fact, the way for them to really move their careers forward is to have them send lots of free Mary-Kate and Ashley products to our house. Address them to Savvy, my daughter (get my info from the UPN people). Savvy is gorgeous and doesn't really need any of it. Being the world's first supermodel, the only things that matter to me are oxygen, hair, makeup and clothes. Children, dogs and, of course, society come second.  If they were contestants on ""America's Next Top Model,"" I totally think they would win. We'd just have to stack them one on top of another, to make a whole Olsen. You tell all those fucking pedophiles that they are going to have to deal with me, Janice Dickinson. I will kick their asses, cut off their dicks and send them off to Mississippi. They are fucking pigs. Personally, I did not have plastic surgery until the end of my shelf life as a fashion model. Now, of course, I'm totally fake. The other day, a photographer told me to smile, and I said, I AM SMILING! It's the Botox.  I will be their new manager. I'll tell them exactly how to talk, how to walk, where to shop, what to wear, how to get invited to the best fashion shows. And I'll send a mobster after all those fucking countdown-clock pedophiles.",24,male

435,"so i've started on what can only be deemed as the ultimate life-long dream of writing my book. what the hell is it about? a memoir? the first hand look from the fuck up girls mind? a sad  modest  desire in me to see my name in print...or just the longer, printed out, mass marketly available version of my blog? i'm not sure exactly..but a couple of days at the book convention thronged with six million publishers, editors, authors and people trying to convince you that writing is the ultimate thing might do that to you.   or not.   we'll see. :P  how's la been, everyone seems to ask?  or at least all 368k of you that took up my inbox space that hotmail threatened to kick my ass and stick needles up me.   it's fine. it's beautiful. it's sinfully amazing.   i've spent more hours in the sun, basking in the glow of very deliciously tanned boys from god knows where and from every corner of the earth..getting in line with everyone and their mother's being sucked into fucking great marketing from the people at universal, rediscovering my love for mickey, the anaheim ducks and bloody basketball and every damn news coverage of the downtown la area and back plus getting to know the bellboys, the housekeepers and the man that stocks up the mini bar daily very well. life is beautiful and things do seem to be getting better for the most part.  i take these long walks late at night after the partying is over and everyone's returned back into their rooms...and i walk these streets and streets that seem so ancient and so emcompassing at the same time. i take a million pictures of the beggars lining up the streets and the drunks returning from a good night out with feathery boas and weird dress sense and make friends with the new faces from different parts of the world all here on holiday or for the book convention. it's quite strange really.  i've been to quite a few of these things growing up. my dad's business things but suddenly i am eighteen, sorta kinda grown up now and put into a different light. i meet these publishers that have seen me grow up and i run into their arms for the great big hug and i feel secure. papa rold especially and he shows me his cellphone and how my names imbedded in there and it's wonderful. like coming home really.  and me dad. god, where do i even begin? i cried and bawled like a little child when i met him off the plane at lax. he'd flown in from narita and here i was, 6 hours later from pensacola, tired of the plane and fucking anxious to see him and i just burst out crying. i swore i wouldn't do it and even as i said good bye to the other parents, amanda and keith...walking in to board my plane and all that good shit i was still doing fine. laughing, making stupid jokes, tinkering around and being silly....but then i saw my dad and suddenly i felt so many things and it was as if some switch in me had turned on or turned off rather and i was my dad's little spoiled princess child again and i didn['t need to be in self-protection bitch mode because i was home. and safe. because it was that feeling of being loved for whoever i was, whatever i'd become and whoever i was going to be. it was a good feeling really and i've missed my dad and it's funny how much you realize what love truly is and means.   there's been so many little things in the past few days that have just sorta taken me aback and made me so thankful for my family. from the little surprise package my mom sent with my father to the gentle caring glow that reflects in their eyes. the way he sorta boasts and tlaks about me to his friends/business people and the way i know he's proud of me and i can be a cocain crack homeless absolutely useless addict shithead and he'll still find something to love. that just amazes the hell out of me and i am blessed. truly.   i tlaked to jared the other night too and it was odd. there's a lot to be said about the ups and downs i've been through in the last few months but i feel sorta grown up yet naiive in some way now. some part of me is so ready to conquer the world, live out my life to the fullest extent i can live it too and yet at the same time i'm sorta chilling and taking things one thing at a time. it's weird.   my brother's going to balk at this but here i go again tlaking about change as i move on into a high. bloody manic depressive freak. :P  some little part in me is beginning to believe in myself...it's as if these last few days i've seen all these people believe in me and seen how i am someone in someonelse's life and it's weird. i don't know.  i'm also a little worried about ryan at the moment but i suppose i'll ring up jessica tomorrow. i'll be home in less than a week and that's a crazy crazy feeling.   wow.   i've also clocked in at least 200 laps in the last few days at the pool so that's kinda cool too. my bullimia is somewhat under control but it's still somewhere there but you know, you take it one step at a time eh? i don't know, but i'll be right...:)  hm. i need to get back to writing the damn thing and sending out some postcards so i suppose i'll talk to you guys later.   i love you and take care okay?  i miss you!",25,male
436,"movies...   I'm having a lazy-day.  *sigh*  I was all gung-ho about going out with Hannah and getting my shiny new Cal. State Id card, and realized...waaaait! I don't have a stroller! The two strollers we do have are in the trunk of our car...which is in Glendale with Deane today *sigh*.  So then I called Deane's brother and they offered to let me use one of their strollers...so I said OK! Good idea.  Then I changed my mind like an hour later and decided to just let Hannah stay home and rest today and hopefully *fingers crossed* feel better.

440,"urlLink    A typical cell phone user at North Lake  So I come into work this afternoon, and see sitting out in front of the circulation counter a large fishbowl with green aquarium rocks in it and what appear to be one or two cell phones, on which is taped a large sign that says ""Please turn off cell phones...or deposit them here!!!"" Now, most people are not going to want to leave their cell phone in a bowl and out of their reach, let alone in a bowl mixed with other strange phones carrying God only knows what diseases. So one would be led to believe the implication is that we wish you to turn you cell phone off before entering. BUT...that's not what the sign says. Clearly, there are two options, including the option to leave the cell phone in the bowl...with no requirement that it be turned off before it is left in the bowl. So you can, in theory, leave your cell phone in the bowl  turned on . And being as this is a public library I can guarantee that at some point some patron will leave their cell phone in the bowl,  turned on . And naturally, that someone will try to call this clever patron while their phone is in this bowl of phones. And that, upon hearing it ringing, the circulation staff member currently occupying the counter will rush to the bowl and begin cursing frantically as they dig through phones and aquarium rocks to determine which of the phones in the bowl is ringing.  In truth I am not entirely opposed to this plan, as I welcome all arrangements that produce amusement in their absurdity, and the failure of the arranger to be aware of all natural outcomes of their action. It is my fondest wish to see this particular outcome before I leave.",23,male

443,"why i hate my name. again.  (The scene:  urlLink Chaat Cafe , last night. I'm at the counter with my boyfriend, ordering dinner. This time, instead of italics being in Chinese like in previous posts, italics signify a heavy, heavy Indian accent.)  Ernie: Hi, one chicken pesto stuffed naan and a chicken tikka dinner please, to go.Woman at the counter: Okay. What's your name?  Ernie: Ernie.  Woman: What?  Ernie: Ernie.  Woman: Ornie?  Ernie: Ernie.  Woman: ORRNIE? [flashes Ernie a dirty look]Ernie: ... yes.Woman: Hrm. [writes my name down, hands it to chef]  After paying with my credit card, I open up my wallet and look for some cash to put in the tip jar. Since I only have bills above $10, I decide I'm not that generous and put my wallet back in my pants, only for the woman cashier to notice and give yet another glare of death. ""I think she hates me,"" I say to Mike.  So, I'm sitting in one of the benches marked for to-go customers, taking in the ambiance; there are framed pictures of Bollywood stars, and the restaurant is still filled with mostly Indian patrons, a promising sign of knowing whether the restaurant is going to be good or not. (As opposed to a restaurant that has a name like, say, ""Rick and Mollys House of Sushi."" Right?) Although I find it funny that the Indian chef calls out for the name ""Horny"" for a to-go order.  What kind of Indian name is Horny?  The chef repeats the name again. ""HORNY?"" on the giant microphone. Except this time he is looking straight at me.  Now at this point, I'm not necessarily thinking he's trying to say the word ""horny"" - I'm thinking the cashier wrote the name ""Ornie"" and he's just pronouncing the name a little differently because he's not from America and it's like the game Telephone, when you sit around a circle with your 12-year old friends and you giggle as the phrase ""The love of Jesus surrounds me"" turns into ""blah blah blah (fill it in yourself - as far away a possibility as what it WAS),"" so I'm telling myself that it's cool, no harm, no foul.  And only THEN do I look down on the receipt. And there under the order, written in large letter with a giant BIC pen, do I see my name spelled the following way:  H-O-R-N-E-Y.  I look over to the cashier in horror. She's helping another customer, oblivious.",24,female
444,"Margaret Sanger: Not only did she favor abortion, but she proposed forced sterilization for those whom she considered unfit to reproduce. She worked hard for a ""race of thoroughbreds"" until Hitler’s similar ""Master Race"" made that goal unpopular. She was a true eugenicist. For example, her April 1933 Birth Control Review, devoted an entire edition to eugenic sterilization. Whom did she consider unfit? Black people, Jews, Southern European immigrants (especially Italians), but also others of ""low I.Q."" These ""feebleminded"" people were a ""menace to the race."" Margaret Sanger, the famous founder of Planned Parenthood, was supportive. She wanted ""more children from the fit, less from the unfit."" This wasn’t only related to contraceptive planning. A seditor, she printed grossly eugenic material, approving of Hitler’s sterilization program (see Into the Darkness, Nazi Germany Today, by L. Stoddard, p. 196). She believed that ""Negroes and Southern Europeans were mentally inferior to native born Americans."" She found these people, Hebrews, and others ""feebleminded,"" ""human weeds,"" and called them a ""menace to the race."" In 1933, her Birth Control Review devoted an entire edition to eugenic sterilization. Sanger’s famous ""Plan for Peace"" was almost the same as Hitler’s, even going beyond it to suggest, in essence, concentration camps. ""When the world realized the logical consequences of Hitler’s hereditarian-eugenic, totalitarian type of government, Margaret Sanger’s birth-control movement had to take a quick step away from its overt eugenic language.""Let us quote from her ""Plan for Peace."" This was little more than peaceful genocide. She wanted the United States: - ""To keep the doors of immigration closed to the entrance of certain aliens whose condition is known to be detrimental to the stamina of the race, such as the feebleminded as determined by Stanford-Binet I.Q. tests. - ""To apply a stern and rigid policy of sterilization and segregation to that grade of population whose progeny is already tainted, or whose inheritance is such that objectionable traits may be transmitted to offspring. - ""To insure the country against future burdens of maintenance for numerous offspring as may be born of feeble-minded parents by pensioning all persons with transmissible diseases who voluntarily consent to sterilization. - ""To give dysgenic groups in our population their choice of segregation or sterilization. - ""To apportion farm lands and homesteads for these segregated persons where they would be taught to work under competent instructors for a period of their entire lives. [Practically speaking, a concentration camp.] - ""[To] take an inventory of the secondary group such as illiterates, paupers, unemployables, criminals, prostitutes, dope fiends; classify them in special departments under government medical protection, and segregate them on farms and open spaces as long as necessary for the strengthening and development of moral conduct."" (Again, concentration camps.) She said, ""The most merciful thing a large family can do for one of its infant members is to kill it.""  Furthermore, there are alternative methods of birth control. NFP leaves the act intact while reducing the risk of pregnancy moreso than condoms. It also has no side effects present in the pill or other medicines that attack and pervert a woman's hormones.  The great thing about this country, obviously, is that everyone can be sexually promiscuous without repercussion or responsibility, since we're all just animals anyway. The only difference is that we animals go to ""colledge,"" so we oughta be able to control us selves. But a little self-control? Whoa, obviously the Founding Fathers never intended that to happen. AMERICA: self-control optional. It was actually on the last page of the Constitution, but it got lost in the fire at the White House in the war of 1812.  See ya.",16,male
