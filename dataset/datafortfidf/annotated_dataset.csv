0,"No emotion So I have come to a point after many years of depression and a self-depricating mindset that the only emotions I feel anymore are annoyance and frustration. These emotions are triggered, so it's not like an anxious constant frustration, only about 2 hours of each per week I would say. Any other times it's only neutrality. Anger, pleasure, joy, stress, all gone. Except for a brief 3 month period over a decade ago, for the first time since I can remember I don't feel depressed and lonely. I have made a certain lifestyle decision that I think is against the rules to elaborate upon, but I don't know whether to be worried. I mean, isn't an almost complete lack of emotion a sign of some sociopathic killer type of thing? I have never had murderous impulses and condemn human suffering, but from what I understand no emotion is a very bad type of thing. Or maybe it is peacefulness and I'm not sure that I know how to process this. I don't want to be crazy, but that type of thing isn't something one has control over, is it? Then again my suicidal tendencies are stronger than ever. Without a filter of emotion with which to process my thoights and motivations, I don't know where my thoughts and actions amy take me.",1
1,"WOW everyone here is my life savior!! Hi everyone, I've been reading the forum for a few hours and I can't believe how alone I'm NOT!!! I've cried, I've even yelled at the computer at some peoples posts and responses...out of love of course not anger...but who am I to judge, right? I'm on the fence of of suicide once again in my life...I've convinced myself that my presense is a bother to the small amount off people in my so-called life. That's including my daughter and my cheating husband in Iraq returning home in 2 days.... my suicide attempts in the past have been weak and just cries for help...yet I'm seriously considering it now...no holds bar...not talking to anyone about it...waiting for the right amount of meds to take, decided if I was really going to do it...why go to work, why pay my bills this month...why tell anyone? Honestly I don't want to die, I don't want to leave my daughter but she's 13 right now and naturally selfish by age...so I've convinced myself she's better off, she has her father who will give her a better life than I can. I love my job, yet that is ending in 6 weeks...off to umemployment I go...which won't cover my bills or rent, so I'm forced to have my daughter move in with her dad 4 hours away....I did have everything till the day I found out my husband cheated on me 3 days before he left for Iraq. I tried to stay strong...and didn't even tell him I knew because of where he was and didn't want to cause him more stress ""over there""...yet after 4 months of verbal abuse from him accusing me of cheating and doing whatever I want because he's not around I had it and told him....he changed his tune after that....then I found out about a girl online he was starting a internet relationship with...that's when I decided to leave...and I did being strong and standing up for myself and not teaching my daughter that it's okay to let people shit on you.... So I hear I sit on a pathetic sunday afternoon writing to you guys...cause someone hear may understand or relate...no one in my life understands...everyone thinks i'm idiot for leaving my husband casue atleast with him i was financially okay....sometime i think they were all right cause atleast back then...i didn't want to die...i just felt like i was dying a slow death....o yeah..I drink all the time too..another habit i started in the past 6 months....I'm even considering cutting now...I did it back when I was a teenager....I liked back then thought maybe doing that would give me a few more days.....I'm messed up and alone....and I'm really just looking for some friends...that can relate and I do the same....I really don't want to die alone....",1
2,"""Hope"" I have a ""see what happens"" approach to suicide. I guess for some people that's just hope. I don't like calling it that because it doesn't come off as being like a grounded solution. I like painting what could happen as a possibility that's almost pointless not to observe, because that's something my thinking brain can understand. That keeps me alive without really keeping my ""hopes"" up. Sometimes even that feels pointless, though. Sometimes I'm just suffering because whatever, fuck me I guess. Like there's no reason for it, and no reason to endure it. Better to post that here than to crave sympathy from actually nobody.",1
3,"Dealing with the demons I could probably write for hours about why I feel the way I do but the gist of it is that I don't feel like life has anything for me. I'm going through a lot of crap recently, and while I understand a good portion of it is self inflicted I can't escape the dark thoughts in my head....I've never tried to harm myself previously but life has been feeding me relentless shit for almost two months solid (and obviously before that, it's just that previously there were bits of happiness to break up the funk). It terrifies me that one day I'll be all alone (like always) and just decide I've had enough. It would be over in seconds. There would be no more pain, hurt, betrayal, lies, nothing but the perfection that can only exist in nothingness. I know there's good in the world. I'm sure there is. But I don't make friends well and my own family doesn't even seem to really care all that much. I so desperately want to just find a friend I can talk to about this shit. I've been told I need to see a counselor. I don't. I don't need just an hour of help per week. I need somebody I can text and talk to at 3AM when I'm at work all by myself with no distractions and I know the girl I love is laying down to sleep with someone else. I need to step back from the edge, and I guess I need to be convinced that the edge isn't all that great to begin with. Is there a term for any of this? Not necessarily wanting to kill yourself but feeling like one horrible thought or realization would push you over the edge? It's literally driving me crazy and I just don't know what to do anymore. Thanks for reading I guess. Hopefully this works. I'm running out of ideas.",1
4,"another close call today i was sitting in my room, writing down some thoughts in a notebook, and i suddenly had a really strong urge to commit suicide i thought about it pretty hard... two of my roommates were home, but they were in the other room, and my other roommate was out of the apartment. i knew my other two roommates wouldnt notice anything, if anything they would think i was sleeping but probably wouldnt question it. i didnt even think of how my roommate would react when she came home... i didnt really care. the only thing that stopped me was the fact that i was pretty sure i'd heard that committing suicide that way is a really painful/slow process and i wouldnt want to put myself through all that. it was terrifying though... i mean, ive stopped myself twice now, but what about next time? will anything stop me then? its especially scary that the fact that people were right in the next room didnt really stop me or anything.... im just really scared, and i dont want to talk to anyone, not even my therapist... i feel like ive gone backwards, like i cant talk to my roommate anymore, i cant talk to my therapist, i cant talk to my friends... i feel like my roommate is tired of me talking to her and i know its stressing her out and she hasnt asked me how i am in a while so im assuming she doesnt want me to talk to her anymore... so im not... but thats also causing me to close up to everyone else as well...",1
5,"here we go again depression coming back...that's right...time for me to complain. I'm not getting anywhere with this...I wish not to talk to someone face to face...my dad isn't home...I'm drunk...I'm hurt... No one is home but me. I'm all alone. I can't get ahold of my boyfriend and I cut myself...I am not calling any hotline cuz I will not share my voice... I dun deserve to live I want to die, to get out of all this pain My family won't miss me...my dad barely knows I'm here he goes to work everyday forgetting that he has a daughter...my mom lives a state away...I can't see her...she won't know... until my dad calls her saying he found me dead. my brother doesn't care...my sister is only 4 she won't know.... my grandmother knows nothing about me...the rest of my family can care less. My bestest friend wont even take this seriously and my boyfriend isn't answering his phone. I think it is time...",1
6,"i’m sad and confused. I’ve self harmed. I’ve thought about suicide, but not this much before. i’ve been so stressed and just so sad and angry all the time. and i don’t get it. my boyfriend supports me. he’s amazing. my mom is great. my dad is too. i live with grandparents. my grandma bitches at me and it’s proably verbal abuse, but she’s super lovey as well. it makes no sense. i’ve tried to get my grandma to let me have a mental evaluation, but she just ignores it. maybe if i harm myself enough to hospitalize me, maybe she’ll realize that i want help. i want to know why i’m sad. i want to be happy. i don’t want to actually kill myself i guess i just want her to see that i’m not okay and i want help.",1
7,"Lost my sister .. and perhaps myself .. Honestly .. I happened upon this site in searching for an answer as to why I have been so depressed and thinking ... . Sept 12th was the date my older sister killed herself. Every year since, but especially the last 3 years, has been a struggle. I've been in public service for many years and for the past three years have been in Iraq. All of my kids are gone and into their own lives over these last three years ... and for their success and enjoyment of/in life I am thankful. But all too often my dreams now are haunted by the death of my sister -- and I dont know why its been so consuming of all my thoughts as of late? Until now I have never spoken to anyone about it. My parents divorced soon after .. and I was alone throughout the years before I left home and went my own way. I guess since then until now I compartmentalized it all .. but for some reason its flooding back now. I feel alone again .. and in trying to understand the reasons for what she did I cant say that I havent had like thoughts. I kept thinking of what the best situation would be that would have the least impact on my kids. If that is even possible? Nothing I've read nor thru my own experiences in life have really helped me. I think I see on one hand that somehow I must never ever consider doing what she did. But I just cant find a reason that my life has anymore real purpose. Perhaps I never really accepted or dealt with, nor struggled with, what my sister left behind. I guess now I find myself asking questions I should have asked a long time ago? -- How could I have not known since we were so close? Why didn't she tell me; why didnt I notice? Why did she do this too me? I find myself longing desparately to connect with someone, but equally I desire to be alone and away from everyone. I think this tug of war is starting to spill over into my work here ... . I sometimes reason that this is due to me having been here in Iraq for so long, and that I just need to go - home? Only, there is no one .. to go too. The last time I was state side it all just seemed so ... unreal. I don't know if I'm a going to make it or not. ........",1
8,"Does it ever get better? I feel like it is all getting too much again. In May I was raped, I went to the Police but they basically in ways not so obvious but in little hints put it down to me being trans* and gay. I thought that would be the hardest bit going through the forensics and the interview (where I had to explain about my gender, my sexuality and my childhood abuse because of what the forensics showed) but whilst waiting to hear if the perp was going to be charged they offered me no support because it could effect the case if it did go to court. I got bounced between mental health services and SARC neither took responsibility to help me. I then as a transman found out I was pregnant, I felt I had no-one to talk to and tried to take my life. I ended up being arrested for my own safety and took to hospital under section, where I deteriorated end up intensive care and only just survived. After the attempt I had to beg a psychiatrist to put me in hospital on my 20th July. They wanted to send me home but after much pleading and discussing many of the ideation thoughts and impulses in my head he agreed to admit me to psychiatric ward. I was released on Thursday after 3 and half months in patient treatment. I am still just as suicidal as when I went in I still want to die. Now not only do I have to deal with the rape, whilst I was in hospital I found out the police NFAed the case, I lost the fetus due to my actions so I effectively killed my child. I just feel like no one gets me, if I tell mental health workers how I feel, they say it is attention seeking if I was serious I would just do it, but when I do just do it they ask why I never asked for help. So now I feel silenced and like I am walking the tightrope alone and at any moment I could fall.",1
9,"wish to contribute to ""before you kill yourself"" b4 i get banned off this site i'd like to give back. when i feel the urge i have sayings that i picked up over the years that help me to not. i would also like to add to my personnel library by seeing what saying others might use. ------- your parents gave you life. evrything else is a perc. if you were in the ""guff"" awaiting your turn, and you could see your life would be hell, you would jump at the chance to live anyway, knowing you might change it. there is allways some one who would gladly trade thier lifes problems for yours. if you loved some one with all your heart, what would thier suicide do to you....... suicide is a selfish act. ------------ i dont subscribe to all of these all the time, but at any time, one of them might be just enough. i for one am interested in seeing others.",0
10,"son overdosed says it was not suiside attemp Hi I am new here and just looking to see if anyone has any advise.My 14 1/2 year old son overdosed the other night. He said it was a mistake he just took to many pills. I found out from him over a 24 hour period he took 20 perks, 7 viks, 13 xanex and drank tequila. We have a large house and he was treating me like crap so he was in the basement playing video games and I was upstairs and did not really pay attention to what he was up to. I had no idea he had gone around the house and found all the meds we had from previous surgeries for pain and the xanex for my anxiety. I cant believe he almost died and i was mad at him so I was not paying attention. I am trying to digest the whole situation, was he just trying to get really messed up or was he trying to end it. He had been wearing a belt around his neck also said he likes it there it makes him feel comfortable. Anyone have thoughts on this or suggestions how to help him. He is already seeing a psychologist and had just gotten out of a 30 day wilderness RTC.",0
11,"Sick of life and people. So im at a crossroads right now, im 18 male i have a great job , good pay, benifits, the whole deal. I also just moved out on my own 2 months ago. Ive been depressed for a few years, highschool was horrible, i was expelled for drug possesion about half way through my senior year. Finished up at another school though and graduated, but thats not the reason it was horrible, I wasnt bullied or anything, i was just a total loner, completly antisocial. I had 1 friend but he got sick of my pessimistic attitude towards everything and eventually drifted away. My childhood was good, until my parents got divorced, some 5 years ago. And since then shit has gone downhill. Empty, lonely, tired, i know people notice becasue my face looks like death, heavy dark circles under my eyes, i have no emotion when i speak, i have no interests. When I wake up on my days off, i just wallow around my empty apartment all day. Its hard to explain how i feel, it truely is the worst kind of suffering, being isolated. Knowing there are others living, loving, socializing, Its hard to just stand up and go meet people, i wish it was that easy. I know this post wont do anything either, i guess the minor satisfaction of others knowing what im going through is somewhat comforting. Not to be smug, but i envy ""stupid people"" who just look at things the way they want to see them, living blindly in there own little happy world. And they just roll with it. As much as i despise ""sheep"" i sometimes want to be one. I have an addiction, not to drugs, a different type of addiction, a guilty, nasty, pathetic, addiction. One i love and crave, but also despise Im not going to explain though (Yeah its that low and vile). I sometimes wonder if this ""addiction"" is a reflection of my OCD. But what do i know im no psychiatrist. The mysteries of life and death have always facinated me, im not religious (go figure right? He hates the government and is an athiest) Im no liberal either if thats what your all leaning towards right now. But thats beside the point. I was raised catholic, accept god, fear god, love god and you will go to heaven and lead a happy life. Obviously that didnt work out in my favor so therefore i start to denie god. I dont like being looked at as a stupid teenage kid who is a complete ignoramus about the world, when the person making that accusation knows nothing about me or what they are talking about. Why would it matter if im 18 and there 40, knowledge is not obtained by years. Anyways im getting off topic, Why should I keep living like I do? Whats the point of living when you dont FEEL anything? When you dont care if you live or die, will it ever end? The sadness the dark feeling that lurks inside of you day and night? It sounds like a cliche but its painfully true. Im very close to ending it, and frankly I dont see why I shouldnt. Replies would be greatly appreciated",1
12,"A Puzzle I went through my notebook and took the best line or two of each poem I've written, then I put them together to create this letter. This is basicly a puzzle fully assembled. As I read over it my eyes filled with tears and my heart ached so bad, it's just a puzzle but I couldn't say it better . . . I'm fighting a war that I can't fight much more. My eyes can't hold the tears, my mind can't control the fears, and my arms ache for one more hug. You'll never know how broken I am, or why my tears have fallen for so many years. One day soon I will give in. Most will never understand why I chose to die. I try to keep everyone from seeing this broken heart of mine, or the deep emptiness in my once bright eyes. Still time continues to pass, the earth continues to rotate, life and death, good and evil, love and hate as well as peace and war continue. People still laugh and cry, live and die and wonder why. I find myself pacing the floor looking for something I've done before. Looking for something I don't have to think to do. The fog in my mind thickens while the darkness grows darker and I find myself living by the light of the moon. The nights shadows hide my tears. The pain that fills my soul and makes me cry when I'm alone. You'll never find all the pieces of my broken heart, I gave them to God hoping he could fix them while my broken body bleeds itself dry. I can hear the whisper of death calling and I see the dark angels that want to take me away. Please hold me close, hold me tight, hold me all through the night. Hold me so I finally feel what love is. Save me from this place where I'm just waiting to die. Have you ever been lost in some of the most familiar places while the salty tears stain your face? You may see the smiles I show on the outside, but you'll never know how I'm dieing on the inside. What happened to the innocent child, the little one so very meek and mild? If you took the bricks from your wall and climbed back up from that painful fall, if you were able to reach beyond your fears, would that child of innocence still be? Would he be building castles in the sand? Would he still smile back at me? Tis' just a dream, this I know, back in time we can never go. I've had these deep dark dreams buried in my mind but living in my heart. One day nothing will be as it seems and the long awaited silence will start. I'll simply fade into a peaceful sleep and nobody will have the slightest clue why, silently, I begin to weep. My pain relief is so long overdue. Is your world always shadowed by a deep sadness? Do you long for some type of human touch? I wish I knew how to ask for what I need, the natural human touch we all need. Would you hold my hand and teach me how to hug? I wish I could hold back the tears just long enough to expose the broken hearted child in me. Do you hear the soft whispers that haunt the silence of the night or the music nobody else seems to hear? Do you know how to ease the pain of a broken heart? I know my death is coming soon. I'm falling into a dark hole that does not exist. All of my sand castles have blown away in the wind. There's an emptiness in the air, an emptiness that I can feel. Somebody is missing here, somebody has gone away. Their dieing of a broken heart, their dieing scared and alone. Nobody knows the pain they try to hide, and nobody knows this Somebody is me. The days are too long and the nights are too short, I'm caught in a life I wish I could abort. Nobody has realized that it's my tears . . . not the rain. Nobody knows of the nightmares that haunt my mind, nobody could possibly know such fears of this kind. Nobody knows that I'm broken and dieing inside. Take this life of mine, take it far away. Take the air from my lungs, take the blood from my heart. Take the pain inside of me, take it all away. Save me from this place where I'm just waiting to die. I can't stop the loneliness that drives me insane or ease the never ending pain. My heart beats hard, fear and panic fills my trembling body. The fear and emptiness that is so indefinably real. My broken heart is flooded with tears, can a person forget how to cry? I'm carrying an ache I need somebody else to feel, to help me understand. Nightmares are stuck in my head. I can't stop thinking, reliving these things, the things that hurt so much. The only way to stop these memories is to stop my brain. I'm sorry that I could not spend more time with you. But the day has come, the oxygen no longer flows, my heart no longer beats, my body no longer grows, my tongue no longer speaks. I'm ready to simply let go. My tears have never really dried but death will dry them, I know . . . Now my heart is forever still and I'm at peace - that can't be wrong.",1

15,"It can always get worse A little while ago I struggled with severe depression and thoughts of suicide. Had planned out a fool proof way so I wouldn't fail and end up severely crippled. Came close many times. Dad had died, dog I had since I was a teen who was one of my two best friends in the whole world passed away, wife who was my other best friend divorced me unexpectantly and a series of other things went seriously wrong. My best friend drifted away and I had no other close friends left. Only thing that stopped me each time was I still had a very good although stressful job that paid extremely. Thought at least that's something which I could also use to get some help and try again to make a last attempt to turn my life around. Then I got laid off unexpectantly (never lost a job in my life before) with a deep recession and no other jobs available in my area. Now I am also unemployed, have no money and might lose my house on top of everything else that I was depressed about. Prior to the job loss I would have been positive that this would have pushed me over. Some how I'm still here. I came to an important realization though. No matter how bad things seem they can always get much worse. Best to enjoy what you have now. For about 5 years things in my life kept getting worse and I always kept looking back thinking how good I had it five years ago, two years ago, one year and even six months in the past. Thinking what I wouldn't give to go back to where I was back then when at the time I was also depressed and also thinking what I wouldn't give to go back to better times. For some reason now and recently whether it be that I am in the eye of the storm or that thought that I had better savour today because it can always get much worse tommorow I feel calm and ok. Part of me thinks so what if everything I cared about is now gone. Life is a journey and the past was just one part of the experience with the future being another chapter in the journey of life to get to experience. I really hope that this is not just the eye of the storm.",1
16,"Done and Dusted - ready to go I am truly done and dusted now. Let me start with a short history of myself. I have been diagnosed with manic depression since 18 , I m 38 now , been on all sorts of medicine, only helps temporarily. Seen countless psychiatrists to no avail. I was brought up in a well to do family, my dad died of a heart attack when i was a kid, I grew up being a spoiled brat as my dad has left a fair amount of money behind. I trained as a lawyer and at the height of my professional career, I made quite a bit of money. I started partying to no end and became an alcoholic and was dismissed from my job last year. i am tied in a very unhappy marriage , though my wife is very supportive , I never feel connected to her. Now jobless, pennyless, i dont have enough strength to go on. I guess the lesson I want to leave you all is that dont take anything for granted, appreciate what u have before its too late.

18,Depression or suicide???? I haven't decided where the best place is to place this post. I know not to make it too long otherwise people won't read it. But I'm feeling low and not good tonight and I'm not sure if i'm at risk or not. So hence the title of the message. I've been through therapy and meds and understand my childhood and how it has influenced my being and my life.... but I still cannot extricate myself from it all. So I keep questioning my existence and whether I should be here at all. And I don't have a good answer yet.,0
19,I am hanging by my last thread I have attempted suicide before and https://www.takethislife.com/substanc...-worked-44030/ explains a little more of my background. I grow more alone and unsatisfied with my life everyday and I just don't see the point to living an unhappy life. The only thing keeping me alive is the fact that I am my moms only child and I dont want to leave her alone. I need a change in my life for the better quickly.,0

21,"Descending I'm a 20 year old male. Over the past 9 years I've struggled with consistent severe depression and suicidal feelings. There has always been and always is within me a strong feeling that something is bubbling under, that I'm on the brink of getting too sick of it all and doing away with myself. Most of the time, I conceal these feelings and behave relatively normally, except for the occassional glance into nothingness as I drift off into dark thoughts without checking myself. Sometimes the sadness grows so overwhelming that every moment becomes an agonising struggle in which I feel I must decide whether to ""do it"" or ""not do it"". Many times I've been on the brink of suicide for days, weeks, months. I've destroyed everything I own with a hammer countless times, including expensive valuables, and even when I've done it before and regretted it I've done it all over again. I've lay catatonic in bed for weeks, not washing, barely eating, leaving my teeth to rot, not even looking out of my bedroom window. In my depression I've shattered the few friendships I've had, and those I did not shatter withered away out of my lack of enthusiasm for other human beings. I've had educational opportunities but I quickly lose enthusiasm for them and ultimately fail despite having ability. I do not live a hopeless existence. I was just recently given an unconditional offer to attend one of the world's best universities purely on the basis of my talent despite having next to no qualifications. I am in good overall physical health. I'm OK looking, and have been told many times that I have ""swagger"" and ""charisma"", though I know full well that it's a pretense, the only way I know of to hide my misery from other people. A few times I've dropped all pretenses and been frank about who I am and what I feel - that hasn't worked out so well. I've come to learn that people prefer the charade, even those who claim to love me. Anyway, my point is, I know full well that I am priveleged, compared to many. What disturbs me is that I simply don't care, because I have no enthusiasm for life. I have interests and hobbies, but they are hardly worth living for. I know people, but they, too, are not worth living for. If I could, I would forget about forming attachments, forget about enthusiasm for anything and just drift along through life in my indifference, but alas, I cannot do that. I feel too heavily burdened, for I am always weighed down by guilt, regret and doubt. I can never recover from the past. For example, I lost my only real friend over two years ago after an argument and it still torments me every day. Nor can I ever look forward to the future, because it is my natural tendency to expect history to repeat itself and for the same misfortunes to recur in my life. I feel that I am destined to be unhappy regardless of what fortunes befall me. Ultimately I see no reason to continue. I am not mentally ill and have no personality disorder, so I have no interest in seeking medical ""treatment"" and no delusion that said ""treatment"" will lead to any kind of improvement. I recognise that my unhappiness is directly connected to my core personality traits. Truth be told, I don't know why I'm posting this... I guess I just want to see what people have to say. Thanks for reading",1
22,Any last words from the audience before I kick the bucket? I have no friends and have barely had any throughout my 21 years of life. My family thinks I'm a loser. I can't have a real relationship with a guy because I'm too scared after being raped last year. My job prospects aren't good because my grades are mediocre. Nothing is fun to me anymore... Fear of possible consequences is the only thing holding me back from killing myself right now. I want to be absolutely sure that this is the right course of action before I finalize my plans. Is there any reason at all that I should live? What hope is there? I'm having a hard time finding any.,1
23,"My Introductory Post I'm in my early 20s. Since my mid-teens I've suffered depression, general anxiety, and social anxiety. I find it very difficult to function on a daily basis, and so pursuing a career in anything I'm really interesting in seems like a far-off dream. As such, I work part time doing factory work, dreaming of what I would really like to be doing. My childhood has been full of neglect and emotional and physical abuse. I speak to both parents (who are divorced), but feel a lot of hurt from the past, and don't feel I can talk to them about any real issues. I am quite intelligent in a lot of ways, but emotionally I feel like I'm still a child, as though I was never taught how to adjust to adult responsibilities. I've been on Zoloft in the past and now take Effexor. Neither have been much help. I have substance abuse issues and am probably an alcoholic. Last week I was drinking with a friend. He had no money and I spent the last of mine at the pub with him. The last thing I recall was dancing with an elderly woman to some blues music, then I blacked out. When I sobered up I was walking the streets with a dollar in my pocket, and my bag from college lost somewhere. It was freezing cold, one of the coldest nights in some time here. I spotted a garage door that was slightly open, so I let myself in and slept in a stranger's laundry. I woke up in the morning and left before they found me. There's been many times when I've woken up on footpaths or gutters. My mother was recently diagnosed with lung cancer, which is quite serious. Her chances are relatively slim. I had sex at a very early age, and have had many sexual encounters since, but have never had a proper relationship. My best friend is twice my age, and in many ways he's more like my father than my real dad. His kids have become like my own brothers and sisters and I love them very much. However, my friend has a family to look after, so the support he can offer me is limited. He is also very religious and I'm not. Often when I discuss my problems with him, he tells me that he was very similar at my age, and the only thing that got him through such problems was God. That sort of thing only makes me feel worse, like there is little hope for me. I see a psychologist sometimes, but I don't feel like I am making much progress beyond just being able to have someone else to talk to. I feel a great deal of distress and anguish on a daily basis. I often feel like no one really understands the extend of what I'm dealing with, and that it would take something drastic like a suicide attempt to make them understand. I don't really want to die, but I often fantasise about attempting suicide, and maybe finally being able to get the help I need as a consequence. I realise this seems selfish and attention-seeking, but I really feel like no one takes me seriously. Often the only thing that stops me is the idea of living with organ damage, and the thought of how my family would cope if I were to actually die. I also have problems with self-harm (cutting). My mother often tells me I should move in with her, that the change of scene will do me good, as if it were that simple. (In actuality, moving in with her would probably be a terrible move, due to her levels of stress and emotional instability.) That's pretty much it, where I'm at right now. These are just some of my problems, other things I can only discuss with my friend and counsellor due to their nature.",1
24,"Cant take this any more... been a while since iv posted here..... any ways.. i just cant take life any more i just cant, christmas time is always hard for me because in 1996 on christmas eve my dad comitited suicide, he hung him self in the bath room. i think about suicide every day, i am in pain every day, at work one of my managers is being a real dick and i am dreading working the rush hour because i have high anxiety. my anxiety is so bad i stopped going to school last year and im only 14 i cant deal with things i was getting picked on, no one would listen to me i was a lone. i still am alone i just dont see the point in living when every day i am in pain every day i dread what the world will bring me every day i cry i think about how i will end my life. i get so close to cutting my veins in my wrist then i remember my mum saying she loves me and i just cry..... i just cant take this any more! i am a failure why should i continue living when i am in pain i am dreading every thing in life. i dont know why i posted here i just wanted to know im not alone i guess.......",1
25,"One Girl Could Ruin It All I feel awful. On the 10th, this girl in my emotional support classroom tried to hit me. And ever since then, things have been spiraling out of control. I was doing so well not thinking about suicide for the past couples months and was almost 2 months clean from self-harm. And then after that... well that weekend, my friend's sister was so rude and mean to me... and then on this past Tuesday I self-harmed, twice. And then Wednesday morning, I self-harmed again. I'm such a failure. And I haven't been able to stop thinking about killing myself since that Friday. The cruel jerks rule this world, why would I want to stay? It's been 4 years since this all began and here I am, still wanting to die. When will it get better? Never. It will never change for me.",1

27,"The Dark Place Well Ive been in a pretty dark place lately, been testing the waters on the couple people I have left that I think might still give a shit and they both failed. Some people call this this a cry for help, but I'm way beyond that. The only reason i haven't killed myself to date is because I thought my two friends gave a shit, that literally has been keeping me alive the last ten years. I have grown spiteful at them, almost as if it's their fault I'm here suffering. So not knowingly at first, I started pushing them away, which was surprisingly easy. Recently I have been getting worse, more depressed, drinking more, thinking about killing myself a lot more frequently, now multiple times a day, sometimes all day until I pass out. I was hoping my last couple friends would pony up and make my being here worth it, but they still believe i'm being weak or acting like a cry baby. On top of all the other crap it makes me want to kill myself just to show them Ive been serious all this time, which i know is a crazy thing to say but I suppose I'm a little tapped at this point. Pretty much close to the end of my rope, not much fight left, in fact i don't care to try anymore.",1

29,"struggling, anyone want to help? If I happen to pass away soon whether it is a natural death or a suicidal death, I want people, especially my family, to know a few things. First this wasn’t caused by any single person. This is not because I’m getting bullied or because of other people. This is because I am not happy with the world or the thought of life. I just can’t stand people and their changes. I wish people could just stay the same way all the time, but that’s life and they can’t and that is why I’m not happy with a lot lately. Sure people say that I have a lot going for me, but I’m not thinking into the future and that’s my problem, how can I look into the future when I’m never happy with the current times? That’s just a calling for a problem to occur. For the past few months now, no matter what help I get, I just can’t and won’t be happy anymore. I’ve dug myself a deep hole and I realize that but I just can’t get out of it. It’s not on my list of priories right now and I would love to find a way to change things, but I can’t find the right help. I’m getting sick of the everyday depression I get, and I thought it was normal at first, but after time went on I can just see that it’s not normal at all and that I have a problem. Anyone with help I would love to hear it, Thanks a lot world. Talk to you later.",1
30,"On My Mind... Everyday I wake up, every night before I go to bed, leaving this planet is always on my mind. It's a hard thought to deal with. Very overwhelming. It's easy for me to picture my deaths in many ways. Sometimes I get lost in the visions and the thoughts, and it gives me a sense of security (oddly enough). The thing that bothers me the most about it, is how taboo it is. We are always told we have choices in life. But if someone chooses suicide, they are thought of as selfish, coward, weak. Not to mention the implications on family and close friends. That is the only thing that stops me. The thing is, I am not afraid of death. I believe everyone has a soul that moves on (maybe reincarnation?) to another place, like a different dimension or something. Everyone tells me I am so young (in my 20's) and I shouldn't be feeling this way. This pisses me off even more. They are trying to put a label as to what I ""should"" be, but I am not. I always feel like I want to run away from something. My fight/flight instincts are always in gear, and it's very tiring. I know life is what you make it, but sometimes life has different plans than what you thought... and life loves throwing out surprises. I just don't know if I want to continue dealing with this. It's not normal. I have a yearning to ""go back"". Back where? Off this planet... but I dunno. This place is dirty and filthy. I don't see the point to it anymore. I'll stop rambling.

32,"lost today I'm trying not to get swallowed back into full blown depression, but its hard. I was trying to avoid thinking, my thought process was if I didn't think at all, than the thoughts wouldn't be negative and I would somehow fight off the depression thats always waiting to pounce. I don't know why I'm posting, nothing changes and everything needs to change to get any better. This seems so difficult for me, sometimes I feel like it will never happen. I'm trying to not let my head lead more than my heart, my heart feels as though its trapped and there's no way out for someone like me. No way to find light and happiness, no possible way to make things better. I know there's no logic in life, no reason for something good or bad to happen...and it tires me out a bit. Anyway I know the whole thing, think positive etc and things will get better. Of course it has to, just continually trying will eventually turn something good, something in your favour. I always promised myself that I would kill myself at 32 and I haven't and that's kind of depressing. Now I'm promising myself I'll kill myself in a year, give my all and if nothing changes for the better, kill myself. I know these aren't happy thoughts but I think its the right thoughts for me. I've been having a hard time lately and it looks like it will only get worse. Will I ride out the bad times? yeah for another year at least. My brother is beautiful, very flawed by such a great guy but I won't talk to him anymore about my feelings. They are so repetitious and exhausting, how could they not be exhausting for him too? Don't get me wrong I am going to try to fight but I won't fight forever, I refuse too.",1

I always make shit decisions in life & I end up getting hurt so badly. There must be something wrong with me. I'm so pathetic it's actually embarrassing. I've been planning to move abroad to make a new start but now I think it would be easier for a lot of people if I was dead. I'd have to pack all my stuff up first though as it wouldn't be fair for someone to have to gather all my belongings. I wish I had the guts to do this tonight. I'm too pathetic to try. My only hesitation is my mum as I don't want to hurt her but I can't go on like this. My life is so shit & no one knows how much I am struggling, people think I should just cheer up & go out more. I can't. I can't eat properly either, I've lost nearly 2 stone as I have no appetite.

I have felt this way for so many years and I can only hope that one day I will be brave enough to carry through. I'm tired.

Drink a caustic fluid? possibly...Walk the railroad tracks into a passing train? possibly....Purchase a gun? possibly....Razor blades? possibly....These are thoughts that haunt me every day.

It's those times when I'm completely out of the strength to keep on holding on to the last rung of the ladder that I'm the most afraid for my life. I don't really want to let go, but I *cannot* try any more. Life hasn't worked so far and I'm out of the gas required to keep on going to see what's over the next hill. I've tried twice. I'm not there tonight - my tank of denial has some fumes and I've got my rose colored glasses on - but they're wearing on me and I can see the long road past them anyway. *taps at fuel gauge* Nothing is terrible. I have a fantastic job. Romance has had the normal ups and downs. Family & Friends are awesome people. But I can't make myself function as part of society; I genuinely don't know how without faking it and it takes *so* much energy and only works for a few hours at a time. Everyone who knows me knows a character I made up and make up every day so that I don't stumble out into the world like an alien. The character forgets its lines sometimes, though. Or smiles when there should be tears. Most people smell something off about it and just don't accept it at all - no matter what it looks like or what it says. I'll always be peering in the window from the cold outside looking in. And if I'm always going to be on the outside - and I'm old enough and experienced enough to strongly believe I will - then I just don't know what to do. I only get joy from friendships, family, and loves. The rest is just passing the time. I'm very, very tired and the spinning panic comes more and more frequently. My life will end with a shrug, I think, after the panic is done and I can't...anything...any more. I'm terrified of the stillness. Hi, I'm new here. :/",1

In 5th grade all the problems started, my best friend passed away, I was mad at the world. 9th grade I lost my grandpa, my great uncle and another family member. 10th grade I lost my best friend, my math teacher/running coach. First year of college I lost my mentor in life and faith. When will the pain end, when? Maybe I should just end it now? Whats the point in living when u lose everyone who is important to you? Its going to be 9 years this March since I lost my best friend, it hasn't gotten any easier...is there hope? because right now I am struggling to see it... is there anyone out there listening?",1
52,"Is thinking about death and dying similar to ""suicide""? I know the dictionary definition of suicide is taking your own life - right? But what about continually thinking about death and dying? Is it similar to suicide? My life has ""felt"" different ever since September of last year. I guess the catalyst for the change was a relapse in CFS/ME. This chronic condition has taken away some more ""living"" for me. Less energy, less focus, less ambition; more pain, more fatigue, more brain fog. It has impacted my work, my social life (not that I was a big social butterfly before), and my marriage. So now it's been 6 1/2 months of living a less engaged or active life ... and I find myself thinking about death and dying a lot. At least every day. I am not making any plans, I am not acquiring any means/methods, I am not finishing up any loose ends, and I am not actively working through any bucket list. But I have this strong sense of apathy - you know that inner ""meh"" you feel whenever you think, I should do the laundry/call a friend/start a new painting/ or anything that speaks of vitality or interest or meaning. And today that apathy or pointlessness is really strong. It's as if I don't really care about being alive anymore. I feel bored and unmotivated ... I go through the paces, go to work, keep the house liveably clean, wash the dirty underwear, take out the trash - you know all those menial boring daily duties that right now seem so stupid and ridiculous. As if any of it really matters! (Well, I guess having clean underwear matters to those near me.) I guess it's the depression - combined with the illness/being unwell. Yeah it is. I'm feeling depressed about being in pain, tired, and foggy. It's making me feel less connected to aliveness. Maybe I should've posted this in ""Venting"". I'm okay - I'm not at the edge or anything. Just a really really flat mood that makes me think death is not such a bad thing. What stops me though is my spiritual beliefs - and I want to stress spiritual, not religious. Somewhere deep down inside me, there is this stubborn voice that keeps telling me that I was given this sacred gift of Life and to throw it away would be very disrespectful to what I call Kitchi Manitou, or Great Spirit. And it would violate this inner value of cherishing the sacredness of life. I do - I value all of life. Especially the children. These little people also keep me wanting to stay alive, even if it's to give them one more hug or one more word of encouragement. That's really what is keeping me going right now. But I'm merely existing, not living. I guess that's okay, isn't it? Coasting for a while? But I really really miss moving myself - ""swimming"" if you want to look at it metaphorically. As in, propelling myself with intent and purpose and hope and courage. So maybe I should've posted this in ""Grieving"". Sorry everyone for my meandering! But this is therapeutic ... so thank you if you read this, and if you have something to say about this TTL topic. I hope you all keep safe and stay alive tonight. Cuz there's be an empty space in the world without you, and that would be really sad.",1

54,"I just don't know. I've been reading about for over an hour and I feel a bit strange. Most of what I've stumbled upon speaks of childhood, so far a way. And yet I'm sitting here, just turned 14. I know that many of you would say, you're just 14, how could you know true pain? But this is only getting worse. And I urge you to remember that pain is relative. I've taken ten arrows, and you've taken 100, but what only hurts you a little brings me to my knees. Until recently self-harm has seemed like a sort of thing we talk about in health class, but the other day that changed. Two weeks ago life hit me like a train, and out of distress I took a near by letter opener and slashed me wrist. It wasn't much and I thought of it as a fluke. Then the next day at school, just as the pain had subsided, I realized I wasn't bothered by the pain. In fact it felt... strangely comforting. By that Wednesday I found myself hungry for that feeling, more so than for food. That Thursday I came home in tears and found a blade a blade I used to use to carve wood, now I use to carve into my arm. Suddenly this far off story, was my truth. The problem is, I don't want it to be that way. When I was little I used to think of offing myself, I had nerve back then. But now I've realized I don't have the nerve for that. That said I still have moments like this : Some random person : ""Years from now you'll look onto this moment and spend the rest of your life treasuring this."" My mind : ` not hard to believe if my life is almost over. ` But the truth is there are a few people in my life I know I'd hurt, and somehow, that makes me unable to even think further than that empty wish. What I'm scared of is that this is only the beginning. But I'm to scared to look for the end.",1
55,"I think about ending my life... ...but then there would be nothing left. It's not like I'd become an angel and go up to heaven. It's not like I'd reincarnate and live a better life. We have only one life and that's it. Also it's good to remember that things change. People change. I might be destined to be severely depressed this year, but next year I might be destined to come out of it. The point is that we never know when and how things will improve. Life is like that.",0
56,"I rationally believe that ending my life is my only option. Excuse me for posting this so soon. I have been reading through the forum, but find no words of my own to offer to others yet. I have been wanting to kill myself daily for over two years, and I have many good reasons to do so. It's is a long story, and ultimately all my fault and proof that I am a lowly human being who is not worth being in anyone's life. From age 18 to 28, I was involved in building a fantastic arts scene in my community. By the age of 28 I had it all, I was ecstatic and on top of the world. I had the best friends anyone could ever want and the opportunity to be an artist. Of course the art scene is heavy into drinking, as was I at the time. We were all functional alcoholics. My husband of less than two years had been going through a year-long training session through work. We worked opposite schedules and would only see each other for an hour here or there throughout the week, usually at 2am when he'd meet me at the bar. I became close with a much older veteran artist. We'd been friends for 7 years. He fell in love with me and pursued me like mad. I did something I never dreamed I would do. I was black out drunk, common for me sadly, and slept with him. I felt so confused by the whole ordeal I told myself that must have been my choice and what I wanted, and I did it once more intentionally. Then I called it off. Then everyone found out. My husband reignited his own affair that I thought had ended once we were married. Then he left me. He left me in a house I couldn't afford, and on the day I moved into a guest house he said he'd changed his mind. I was hated by most of the arts community. Very hated. Banned from theaters. This older man was not. Life was hard for a year, but I still had some of my closest friends. Then my husband left me again. I decided I needed to leave the state. I sold everything I owned and moved in with a friend who said she had a great house she'd just bought. We drove for three days to a house with no AC or heat, no hot water, and an illegal addition that electrocuted us if we touched the window sills. It was also in a horrifying neighborhood. We both drank as soon as we woke up daily and talked openly about suicide. I knew that situation was going to kill me, so I went back home after three weeks, and she never spoke to me again. She was one of my closest friends. I moved in with my best friend. I was drinking like crazy, talking openly about depression. I had been seeing my therapist and psychiatrist regularly. One night I was so sick of feeling homeless, and so ashamed of binge drinking that I checked into a hotel. All I had with me was what I'd purchased at the grocery store. Alcohol. I'd only intended to drink. I was given a room at random, however it happened to be the room that my friend's stepfather killed himself in five years earlier. I texted him this and drunkenly asked if it was a sign. He called the cops. The cops came, I was fine, though drunk. My friend who I'd been staying with and his girlfriend came. She had me involuntarily hospitalized and said i was trying to kill myself. In order to have the petition go through there were also several false accusations. The petition said I had an illegal amount of a controlled substance and that I was refusing any professional help. It painted me to be a homeless drug addict, so I was put into a holding room for 27 hours with 80 - 100 unrestrained homeless drug addicts. Many were violent. I was attacked three times, twice sexually. I was then transfered to a state run facility and met with a lawyer. I was able to read the petition for the first time and point out the falsities. They were easy to prove. They just talked to my doctors. This happened on a friday of course, so i stayed until late monday, but the whole thing was dropped due to, ""filing a false petition."" So the county didn't pay for it. I owe $15,000. None of those friends have ever spoken to me again. It has been 12 months. That was a lot. Honestly it sounds absurd and made up. There are so many other things that have happened in the year since the hospital as well, but ultimately the affair and the petition are the reasons I have lost everything. Well not everything, my husband took me back, again. Though I believe he will only leave me. This year I quit drinking. I was devastated to find it had no affect on my mood, though I am quite surprised at how much money I saved. I have a great job. I simply lost everything I'd worked ten years for and all of my friendships. I know it sounds selfish compared to horrible lives some people lead, but it was my life, and i can't handle it being gone. This city is too small to try and rebuild anything. All I do is wake up and wish I was dead. Every day. I am exhausted by this. I have seen therapists. I have been on and off medications. Nothing even makes a dent. I feel like I have already died. I am not the artist I once was, I have no opportunity to be again, as I have been ostracized by what seems like the whole city. I have no friends. I have nothing worth continuing for. All I have is the constant proof that I am not someone that people consider worthy to be in their lives. I am a whore. A worthless whore. Thank you for reading. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to continue.",1

61,"I see a lot of people here... seem to be getting some sort of help from doctors etc. but telling anybody else how I feel truly feel terrifies me. It was hard enough to tell one person how I was feeling and even then I couldn't tell them everything. Have doctors etc. really helped you? I've read some things on some other forums that makes me scared of telling anybody I can't truly trust. To be honest I don't want to tell anybody how I'm feeling but I've been told that I should. I suppose that why I'm here posting this now. I will try to explain how I've been feeling: I feel like there's no point any more, due to feeling the way I do I've screwed up everything and that's just made me feel even worse. I've actually cut myself on two separate occasions; the first time was pretty bad tbh I won't go into detail, the second time wasn't as bad because I managed to stop myself. I sometimes get the feeling that no one really cares about me and the fact that nobody picked up and how low I was/am feeling just seems to backup that claim. I seem to sleep a lot nowadays and when I wake up I often feel like there's no point in geeting up and just stay in bed. For example On Tuesday night\ Wednesday morning I went to bed around 1am and didn't get up to 4:30pm. I then went down had something to eat and just seemed really tired so I went back bed around 5:30pm. I then got back up at 7pm and stayed up until 11:30pm I the slept until around 2pm the next day. I have been for some walks recently but they seem to be getting harder and harder. Today for example I walked for 20 minutes before sitting down on a park bench and I just sat there for about a hour, I just didn't want to get up. My whole body seems to get very heavy especially my legs. I know it may sound clichéd but i just feel very numb a lot of the time. Also I'm becoming very intolerant of people going on about stupid pointless things. I've managed to to keep my anger under control by just walking away, but I know if they keep on at me I'm just going to lose it one of these days. I also cry everyday, I just can't help it. Last Saturday is closest that I've come to truly committing suicide I even wrote a letter and everything, but instead I ended up telling somebody how I was feeling. I still don't see any point in carrying on with this life though. It just seems pointless and I don't see anything getting better.",1

I do't really know how to describe it... Like it would realise me of huge burden...Truth about what? Well, truth about me... how I feel... Who am I actually... because no one knows me from inside... they know only what I show... and that has nothing to do with real me... and if I tell them just before I go away forever, I don't really have to deal with their reactions...

I can't help people anymore, the harder I try the more I fail. I get too emotionally involved and how the hell does that explain me feeling numb? Emotionally involved=no emotion? I'm so numb and want so badly to shed a tear but I can't. And it hurts, it hurts on the inside so much and I just can't handle it anymore. I get myself through each day and think the next one's going to be better but IT'S NOT ANY BETTER it's always WORSE! I can't handle the emptiness inside, I'm going downhill and I've been saying this to people but it doesn't help to bring me back up again. I'm starting to think I'll never feel better. I try to take my mind off things by helping others but I don't help them, I make it worse for them. I go to great lengths to help and get kicked in the face and I can't handle that. There's no way out of this. I don't even know who I am anymore, I can't find myself or my place in life and this really sucks!! I go from feeling fine, getting things doen, to nothing but a complete emotionally numb mess and each time it gets worse and worse and how much worse is it going to get.

My only hesitation is my mum as I don't want to hurt her but I can't go on like this. My life is so shit & no one knows how much I am struggling, people think I should just cheer up & go out more. I can't. I can't eat properly either, I've lost nearly 2 stone as I have no appetite. I can't sleep so I went to the drs & the gave me 3 weeks of zopiclone which helped, but I've just taken my last one, so tomorrow I'll be screwed as they said they won't give me anymore.

68,"Don't understand how people can be like this Hi all. First time posting here. I think the only thing stopping me from throwing in the towel are my niece and nephews. I don't want them to suffer from me not being around. I help a lot with the kids, both physically and emotionally and we love being around each other, so that seems to be the only thing holding me back. On the other hand, I'm so tired of thinking. I can't do this anymore. I wish there was a pill one could take to stop thinking altogether. There's only one way I can think of to stop thinking, and I'm well on my way to taking the leap. I've been thinking about all the different ways I can do it so that it has the less possible impact on my family. I can't live with the fact that people are fake and say things just for the sake of saying it. Recently I met this woman and got very interested in her. We started getting to know each other and eventually we were telling each other things and saying things to each other that people in relationships would say. Things like I miss you, you are special to me, we have a special bond, I love how you make me feel. Then out of the blue it stops. Now we are reduced down to 1 message a day if I'm lucky. I believe she said all of those things to get me to like her and when she realised I did like her and she was liking me just as much back, she cut it off. So I don't understand. Why say things to another human being and then stop saying them? It makes me feel like I've been played and I hate that because I don't do that. How can someone do that? I've lost all hope in humanity. The only way I can think of to not trust anyone again is to just not be around for it to happen. So for now I'll keep thinking of ways to do it.

From this place of inner peace, I have a vision that affirms peace in the world. I envision a world in which spiritual seekers are nourished with divine strength. Conflicted souls learn to forgive through God's compassionate presence. Hurting hearts are healed through God's love. I envision a world in which those who once despaired have hope and where love enfolds us all. All human beings are experiencing and expressing inner peace. From deep within, I claim an indescribable inner peace that is mine to bask in and to share. As I send my peaceful thoughts out into the world, I envision peace reflected back to me from people near and far God means different things to different people I consider myself a spiritual being having a human experience.

He texted me and said he was too busy doing laundry and definitely couldn't be bothered to drive 10 minutes to my house. Then he started ignoring my texts/calls. This made me feel so much worse. Is there even any reason to stay alive if you're miserable, in physical pain all the time, and there's no one who would grieve for you? I would leave all my money to charity so wouldn't it be better for everyone if I just ended it? The money I left behind might be used to save lives that are more valuable than mine.

I did my duties and have nothing to show for it. I have no friends and social life , now with the though of no income it makes it all seem like an nightmare of despair. Why should it be this way.

Im about to end my life... i had been thinking several times for more than a week now and i guess ill do it. i grew up in a broken family, my mom abandoned me when i was born since she wanted fo fullfil her dreams. my paternal grandparents too care of me. at the age of 3 my mom went back and stole me from them, she went to singapore but she left with her aunt, with her promised to give a monthly allowance, after my mom left, she never called nor contacted my grandma. my grandma is good to me sometimes, but her daughters are not, at age of 7 i used to clean the house, wash the dishes and i became thier running errand. when i was in 6th grade my grandma cant no longer take care of me since she already lost her job, she turned me over to my uncle ( mom's brother ) . that was the time that i had a chance to met my mom ( over the phone ) she already lived in Canada. i stayed at my uncle's house while my mom sends money for my allowance, my uncle is nice but her wife is not, i never felt i was part of the family, even my mom sends money, she still makes me feel that im just an additional mouth to feed. i graduated high school, it was also the time that my grandfather died. my mom went back to show her last respect, it was my first time to see her. i was so excited, so happy and all. but she made me feel that i am not her daughter anymore. she told me to look for my father and asked assistance so i can go to college, she told me that she never declared me as her daugher in Canada so it is impossible for her to bring me there, plus her new husband doesnt know everything about me. My uncle and his wife told me to look for my father since my mom cant no longer send money for me. i was able to find my father's family, but he already has his own family and his mother in law doesnt know anything about me , so i cant stay with them. i have no place to live, been sleeping in church, streets , waiting shed. ive done so many things so i would be able to afford to eat and have shelter. i worked and study at the same time, finished college. i met a guy whom i thought will be the answer to my prayers so i can have a family of my own. i got pregnant, he is jobless so i work for us and for his family. after 5 years i found out he is having an affair with our neighbor. i left and bring my child with me. i struggled a lot, working , being a mom, i have to leave my 5 year old kid alone so i can work, my salary is not enough for all our expenses. i recently met a guy, he made me feel so special, so happy, he asked me to stop working because he promised he will come here in my country to see me. i resigned, i depend on him, i always try to tell him let me work because he keeps on saying he is coming next month but its been almost a year but he never been here. he disappeared . my life seems fall down, i depend on him too much, i loved him so much, he disappeared without saying a word. been trying to contact him but he never answered. im getting tired of being temporarily being happy, everything i hoped for, just a simple love i cant have it. yes i am now struggling with financial issuses and emotional issues. what makes me more weak is because of my child, school year is about to start but i cant do anything. if i die.. im sure his father will start to do somethibg for him.",1
79,"I am a horrible person for doing what I really didn't want to do!!! Don't read this if you supported Trump, but ever since this troll, bully, and criminal of a candidate got elected, I just lost all faith in humanity in the most extreme and permanent of ways. Not even a scientist finding a cure for cancer would restore my faith in humanity. I had more faith in DIRT than humanity. My biggest fear with Trump would be that he would turn America into the Western Hemisphere's North Korea, a terrible dictatorship where you couldn't do anything you want, and you had to do what you're told to do or else you would risk death. But here's the biggest thing: What my parents told me I was doing was pulling a Trump myself! They said the biggest reason people voted for Trump was that they were scared and angry. And I completely fit the criteria, despite me not voting for him in the first place! I was scared for what Trump would do to our country, and I was so angry to blame the entire human race for being so stupid to elect a troll! They even said that Trump would go to prison if he attempted to turn America into a dictatorship! I am such a horrible person for becoming a Donald Trump myself and I deserve to die!",0
80,"Disaster After Disaster I'm unmedicated bipolar. I've been without insurance or funds for 8 months now. I was ok for awhile, and I had hoped I'd swing to the other end of the spectrum but no such luck. I've been depressed for months. It just gets worse and worse. In the last week my husband became totally fed up with my depression and the fact that I can barely get out of bed, and he packed up his car and left. Of course he left us with little food in the house and cut off notices on all the utilities, but that's apparently of no concern to him as he's gone back to live with his mother. He's 48. When he stays there they pay all his bills and provide his shelter and food. I had to send my 17 year old son to live with his father. He's bipolar as well. He refused to be medicated and proceeded to punch holes in the walls and terrorize his siblings. We have had him hospitalized on several occasions, he's been in rehab 4 times and juvie countless times. We moved half way across the country to get him away from his friends so he could have a fresh start. Nothing works. I originally went off my meds so I could afford his. I didn't realize he'd been flushing them or I wouldn't have discontinued mine. Now I can't find any programs in this area to help me get back on my meds. and I feel like I've abandoned him, but there are 3 other kids in the house and he was hiding knives in his room. His father has promised he would be taken care of. My 22 year old daughter that is in school in a different part of the country called me over the weekend and told me she had been referred to an oncologist. They found another lump in her breast, this time very near her lymph node. My kids started school yesterday with no school clothes and no supplies. Right now I just feel lucky that I can still feed them. I spent the morning researching rescues for my dogs. I should have sent the kids with their dad. I can't take care of them. I have neither the financial nor emotional resources to handle the kids. This depression is different than most I've had, and I've had many. This time I'm not crying or sad. I'm flat. Cold. I know I love my kids, but I can't feel it. I can't feel anything but the desperate need to escape. I'm backed into a corner with no way out. There is absolutely no way I can catch up the bills. Within two weeks I'll have lost everything. I have grown daughters and grandkids in the area but they think I'm only good for babysitting. My kids would be better off with their dad at least the grandparents will see that they get what they need. I'm exhausted with anxiety. The only emotion left is fear. I haven't had friends for years. If you ignore people long enough they go away, so I've isolated myself completely. I've always been a loner, but now it's killing me. I can't do this.",1

83,"come clean There is, to my knowledge, genuinely only one person who knows how I feel about leaving. Everyday is a fight, and that fight is always a losing one when the folk around you cannot understand what you deal with, what you feel. My problem/problems are not something that can be fixed with kind words, inspiration, proper diet and exercise, etc... I fight horrifying anxiety on a daily basis, sometimes to the point of serious physical damage. It can get so bad that I feel like I'm not actually in the same world as the people around me, and see colors incorrectly. This, and a chronic depression I've had since a young childhood have been eating at me for years and are constantly increasing in intensity. I'm reaching a stage where I contemplate my own end on a nightly basis because the idea of waking up again is so terrifying I shake and I cry. It is not just these two conditions I've stated.. it's just, well heck it's everything at this point. I can no longer handle a full time job, I live on my friend's couch, my vehicle is constantly dying and a slew of other things that I won't bore anyone already bored enough to be reading this bit of business. Now, as previously mentioned there is one person who knows exactly how I feel about all of this and, in a time of need she was there for me and, I stand firm that she and her actions of just coming, comforting, and offering a general understanding are the reason I am alive today. Unfortunately this individual is also an unreliable drug addict who I don't share much else in common with. I don't know what I'm trying say here, I feel that I am all over the place.. on here and mentally lol. Essentially I have been internet researching suicide for the past 4-5 hours alone in a dark room listening to some none so cheery music and I happened upon this forum. Healthy, no? Essentially, I can't find reasons anymore. I think truly that's it. Reasons. Reasons reasons reasons. Perhaps that should have been the title of this pointless venting rant. As you were.",1

I'm never the one picked first and when it comes down to it I'm not important enough. So what if I helped them, didn't stop them from hurting me over and over again. To not bother calling or showing up. Don't think anyone could ever like me. Wonder if it's all just a huge, cruel joke. I don't think I WANT to live in this cruel world, humanity is a fukcing joke. They say they want to farm and slaughter animals in a ""humane"" way - well, humans are the only animal killing others JUST FOR FUN. Is that HUMANE? Humanity will be the end of the world, and I'm not the only one thinking that way. Soon this globe will be over-populated, what does it matter if this life goes to waste? Absolutely nothing.

88,"I want to let myself sink.. I am tired. ( Im sorry for my english, it's not my mother tongue. ) Today I decided for the first time to open up on my toughts of suicide/depression, on the internet. Pathetic right ? I know. I feel like my life is a joke, an entire joke from the begenning and soon to the end. My life cant be put on a couple few lines, pathethics lines which represent my ''life'' . When I was 7, my dad died From a lung cancer and let me tell you it hit like a truck to know what death is at that age, especially when it's your dad. My mom got re-married to his best friend (The most nice guy she could ever met after my father, he ended up me loving him as a father, he is really nice my mom got lucky to get an other man like him) I was doing really poorly at school after that (And I had ADHD already so it didn'T help..). And I was getting fat, so of course I was getting bully pretty much my entire time in school. And of course , it got way worse in high-school and this is when my depression/suicidal toughts started. I felt like I dont deserve to live, seeing everybody able to do what they what they whant, breathe, but I couldn't because I was sinking further and further. ''But'' One day a girl 'enlightened' my life for the first time in my life, the first hope that something was going to change in my life (That's what I tought, I never had a girlfriend before, I just wanted to love someone who loves me back, just for once..) but she broke up with me after 2 week because she was going to move away for her college and she didn't believe in ''long-distance'' relationship but I was willing to do anything for her but at the end she just decided that it was over. After that I was begenning to cut myself because I didn't want to hear my toughts of sadness of how pathetic my life is. I lost literraly all motivation from life and the motivation to go at highschool to get my diploma. I ended up doing a year laying down in my bed and being in front of my computer listening to streams to people who can put an artificial glow in me for a sec. Beside that I hear/do nothing else , just the silence or I should say the loud sound of depression (This was this year) . Yesterday my step-dad was peeing red, my mom was freaking out and told him to do some test at the hospital the next morning. When I woke up (10pm) I went downstair to see my mom drunk (what a surprise she always is) but this time my jaw dropped, I couldn't believe what she just told me something, I wanted to woke up again,not again.... please god....please...please not again....please, im begging you. My mom just said ; - Your stepdad has lung cancer. I feel like I want to move in an other country which isn't oblivion with these toughts. Or maybe go to go into a new/''real'' contry and pretend to have a new life and starting over, but the pressure of depression doesn't want my body to move because my spirit have to much weight and I have no energy to fight, not anymore. I dont deserve to be happy, I dont know what curse I have but when you have the feeling that your life is worthless and seeing death as your best-friend as long as I am breathing. This is the worst feeling, and I want it to stop... But it wont as long as I breathe in this darkness which seems impossible to swim back,and at this point I dont even want to try anymore when there's no glow/light in me anymore, only the dark and a moment or an other, i will embrace it... A moment or an other because I fought so many years, but when it doesn't pay off a single time, you just want to let youself sink. I dont know what to do anymore..",1

I even spoke to my psychiatrist about it today, knowing that I was risking going back into hospital (I'm only out seven weeks now). I'm not breaking any rules.

I feel like I should be apart of an AI rather than a human body. My memory is getting very bad too which is very scary. I thought it might be from taking some shrooms a while back and just hppd, but then I realised I've been experiencing minor symptoms of whatever this is my whole life. I told my parents I need help and all they did was call another stupid ass doctor that put me on a wait list of another 3 months to talk in a room with other depressed people. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY FUCKING TIMES I HAVE TO SAY IT'S MORE THAN JUST DEPRESSION. I think it might be depersonilzation disorder or something which could have been triggered from shrooms and all the weed I used to smoke, but would that account for memory loss? Or not really memory loss...but like its harder to remember things. I also get confused really easy. All I know about this whole thing for sure is that I can't keep living like this. If i dont get help by the end of next month I'm killing myself, end of story. Also, being diagnosed with whatevers wrong with me isn't just going to make it go away, ts pointless. I've ended up pushing my real friends away and now even my fake friends, because I have to much anxiety to even talk to anyone at all. You can say whatever you want, telling me there is help and life is just hard but I have to push threw...but do I? Shouldn't I be able to choose when I want to stop this nightmare?

95,"suicide: it is the way it is. i am an expert at self motivating, at self entertainment. i was abused as a child and survived, so my survival techniques are top notch. but i am now middle aged, and life has beaten me down a lot. the fibromyalgia i've had now for about 5 years and that is taking a lot out of me. i had been avoiding feeling this loneliness, this dejection, by moving things around in my mind, by hiding facts in my mind. therapy has taken away a lot of the ways i used to cope, so i now i get to see all the bad things that've happened to me, i get to see just how badly i have been treated, how alone i am, how i have no money and really no voice in this society, as a person of color, as person with severe illness, as a person with no money. i have no way to protect myself really. and so i am depressed. anorexia was something i had used as a teenager to cope, and i find myself pulling that old one out. voices, basically snapping shut, by protecting my mind, is also an old way to cope. i had been trying to tell myself you are not alone, but now that i see is not true. i spend my days and nights upset and alone. afraid to call anybody, because my story is always so sad and nobody wants to hear that really. it is sad to see that though i 've fought the fight, and though i maintain a sunny attitude given all thats happnened to me, the people around me still do not want to have anything real to do with me. now, they won't say that, and that's how i was able to delude myself into thinking i had real friends. society has no place for me. no treatment for fibromyalgia. no one who remembers my pain about that. no treatment for sexual abuse, so my reactions and actions go unrealized. society really has no place for me. to be satisfied with the poriforery, so that's what i must do. to complain about my human self, to complain what about me, is pointless. to be satisfied with the voices, with the anorexia, with being the science project, with being the zoo animal all oogle at. okay. since i am the survivor that i am, i have learned that this is it. and so i sit here, cold, not okay with being alone but also okay with it, because i have snapped my mind shut, the soft parts are protected. no matter what happnes, the soft parts are protected. i can't be everything. i am just one. on another side, this man once told me he knew this black guy who everybody liked, the life of the party. and one night he went home and killed himself. this was a white guy. and as he told me this story, he looked like the devil. and i knew then that that would be my fate. this world does not respond to a black depression. they just don't respond. so i am left pretending i am fine. to act not fine brings me nobody and nothing. so i am to act like i'm fine. and all the while my mind is sinking lower and lower, and then i too, after throwing a huge party, the life of the party, Ms. Positive, Ms. Look at her, Look how she is making the best out of her Unfortunate Circumstances, and then i go home, alone, and kill myself. i do not reach out. i tell no one.

99,"It Just Pops Into My Head Those who have some good days are lucky. Mine are just bad. I am one of those people who wake up every morning and wish I hadn't. Why couldn't I have just passed out of existence while I slept rather than face another day of nothinginess, of existence not living? I have been living with depression, and anxiety for 40 years. I am 60-years old. I have no joy, no interest in doing anything I used to. Suicide ideation just pops into my head at the strangest times. I went out to my car to take out the CD's so I could listen to my music in my house and the thought just popped into my head. Where did that come from? I wasn't thinking about dying or even wanting to die the idea was suddenly in my mind. I like to be in control and depression and anxiety have taken my ability to control my emotions and thoughts away from me. For years I did control my life, I wore a mask and just told everybody I was ""just fine."" They were awestruck to find out I suffered from major depressive disorder. I agree with those who say that the more intelligent or more educated tend to suffer more from depression yet I don't know if that statement is supported by research or not. Those of us who think a lot, we do the whole existential thing tend to question the value of life more than those who don't spend time mulling over such weighty issues. My therapist tells me to get out of my head and ""think"" with my heart. The problem is my heart died years ago. I have no positive emotions, no feelings of love. I had hoped that when my grandson was born I would be able to hold a newborn baby and feel the love. I felt nothing. How sad is that to not feel love for a child? I also agree with those who say you should not have children if you suffer from depression. Unfortunately I didn't know about the devastation and utter despair of depression before I had my kids otherwise I never would have passed on my genetic structure to my kids. Both have suffered bouts of depression already and it kills me to see them suffer knowing I passed on the vulnerability to become depressed. You know the really ironic part of all this? I have also inherited longevity. My parents are both 92 years old and their folks lived to be 95, 96, and 98. So I have the likelihood of living a very long life - and for what? I don't contribute to society I just use up valuable natural resources that could be better used by other, more productive people. Oh joy. It is almost 5am and i have been unable to sleep most of the night so the rest of the day I will be worthless, fatigued and unable to function - not that I do anything of value anyway.

I'm 19 and I've recently got my BAC diploma (equivelant to SAT in US) I had it a year late because I had to redo a whole year due to constant skipping and very poor grades, however this wasn't always the case, and neither is it the whole story, I've grown up an excellent student, I had prizes and did exceptionally well, I never had friends tho, everyone thought less of me and kept bullying me, at home there's loud arguments everyday, so I became angry and depressed and just gave up on school and became even more of a loner, starting 2006 I've always been at home most of the time on the internet, skipping school and playing games or watching stuff or reading articles, I was decent looking and got interest from a few girls but I never had the guts to ask them out, because beyond my looks there's an insecure unexperienced guy they wouldn't like hanging out with for long, I did have a few relationships when I knew girls were really interested, but I keep being disappointing in matter of personality, and even that had to go one day, I became a hideous pizza face monster starting 2007 and now it has left quite a few big scars on my face and acne is still present; I don't exaggerate at all when I say i'm hideous as hell, and to top it off now I don't even have enough money to continue studies properly, I can't afford rent, bills and school, and when it comes down to it, I live in a Third world country where unemployment rate is insane, unemployed PhD carriers protest in front of the parlement everyday just to be beaten out by authorities, they even do suicide and famine protests, even tho this country is pretty well off compared to other 3rd world countries, you can only live and get a job if you have a lot of connections and money, EVERYTHING from public service to getting a job is handled by bribes, nobody gives a shit if you've got a PhD if you don't have enough cash to BUY your way to a job. I speak 4 languages, quite well educated in scientific matters such as biology, astronomy, anthropology but all my knowledge and talent is just going to waste in this rotten land, when it comes down to it, no matter how much you know, your human needs of fulfillment and achievement will prevail, and if you're failing to meet your needs, your existence seems quite worthless. I still live with my parents, I feel as if I'm crashing against a giant wall and doing it over and over again, I recently knew a girl in europe and we clicked, we spent a lot of time online, she called on the phone, we expressed emotions of love and she was excited about visiting me and even talked about marriage, I envisioned a life with a girl that I love and loves me back, a job with a decent income (anything there beats 5Euros a day min wage here) but it seemed too good to be true, I had my skepticism because I'm not used to a happy world and it turned out quite right, after a while she lost interest, I believed her because I was desperate. Now there goes me, poor, futureless and too hideous to have a romantic life not to mention in a country where most girls are only looking for a rich 1st world husband, I don't exaggerate nor judge, it's their right to seek a better life. I've been quite suicidal for the past few years, I see an very grimm future and if I keep going it's bound to turn me into something evil, twisted, and insane. so I rather skip all of that straight to the grave before it gets any worse because I'm not sure I can handle it. Take this life, I posted this to vent I doubt anyone would have any practical solution.",1

103,"I need serious help Hey... I didn't know how to go about this but I thought I'd give this forum a try I'm a troubled young man (at 24 almost 25) I have been giving plenty of opportunities with my family and friends. I have worn out my resources for places to live and people to be around. My father yesterday told me he doesn't love me anymore and we usually get through things but I feel like he's had it... simply has had it with my lack of trying it's not really anything I've done just simply he's fed up with me not moving forward in life. He said he doesn't really want me around anymore. I don't live in the house with him and the family (him, his mom, etc..) I live in a travel trailer on the family property and the property consists of 10 acres. It hasn't been that bad for me but now that everything is going away I now realize just how good I had it. I've been through the court system and he's tried to get me to do the right thing for so long and I feel like shit about not doing the right things for not just me but everyone who believes in me. Long story short... I need advice on how I'm going to move past this. And the immediate problems are I'm facing potential homelessness or even getting locked up again. And I really don't want any of that I don't even want to be in this shitty trailer anymore. I feel like I should move out but I have limited funds and am living off SSI (social security) for like 700$... and I know I've been a worker most my life but there's some mental issues with me too that doesn't allow me to do well with people - I do however like being around people. My mom doesn't want me around and none of my family is even an option to live with right now. Usually my father is more than good to me - i mean after all he gave me a place to live and tried getting me out of the legal system. But now he's beyond mad and it's almost like he's possessed I know it sounds weird. But, it's just not like him and I'm positive it's my fault. I have been feeling somewhat imaginary suicidal lately and I don't know if I should use that to get into an institution or to just lay down and accept whatever trouble comes my way. I just really need some advice on the whole thing.",1

105,"Parallel Universe i live in a parallel universe: one, as a part of the human race, in which i talk and laugh and relate with other people. i do social relationships and enjoy the comraderie. the other universe is my personal universe, and in it, lives the flashbacks of the incest, my extremem loneliness, my anxiety and fear, and the resulting psychosis. i am a member of both universes at all times. i don't know how i mangage to juggle the two, and i don't juggle them well at all. i am amazed, though, that i can sometimes appear completley normal, because it requires so much calculation, so much energy, so much vigilance, that i am exhausted by the end of the hour, and must retreat to the safety and privacy of my home where i live alone, and where i can talk out loud or not talk out loud (to myself), where i am free to be whomever i am in whatever moment in time i find myself in. i can be 3 years old, crying, with my arms up to my head in defensive mode. i can be the sexual me, be seducing some man and having my way on my sheets in my bed. i can be jesus, and sacrifice my flesh and blood. i can be office me, and respond to emails in a professional way, and type up my speech notes to look organized. i can eat my favortie brownie sundae, with Ben & Jerry's and frosting galore in peace. i can hug my teddy bear for hours, completely naked, curled up in a ball on the living room floor, chained to the table. i can be whomeve i need to be, without fear of cruel criticism. Where is the suicide part to all this, since i posted this in the suicide forum? I want to kill myself when i am in universe #2. i find life worth living in universe #1. if i kill myself in universe #2, universe #1 also ceases to exist. and i don't know how to reconcile this problem.",0

107,"The New Stuff these are the things that i've only very recently accepted --my dad incested me; my memories are my own, are real. my body is telling me the truth, and i can trust it. i have schizophrenia. i have a serious mental illness, that seriously impairs my functioning. that i have no control over. that severely limits my abilities. that prevents me from working, that traps me in poverty. i have a severe mental illness that will not disappear, and will never improve. i am stuck with a mental illness that makes my senses lie to me, that will always keep me guessing what's real. i am a sex addict, obessessed with sex. it is directly related to being raped by my daddy. i am broken beyond repair because my daddy did what he did. my daddy took almost everything when he chose to ravage my body. i love my daddy. always have and always will. he made me feel good, and i love to feel good. i can say out loud, ""I love my daddy,"" even though it sounds kinda creepy, kinda weird. I know i am mad at him AND i love him. (AND i am forever his.) my mom is unavailable to me. she is incapable of supporting me in the way that i need. she will never make me feel safe or loved. i accept the fact that she is my mother in name only. my siblings are also limited. they reject me because they've had the same mother i did; they are lost and child-like, too. i pity them and i pray for them. drugs and alcohol are only going to delay the inevitable. i chose not to do them because it will not fix my brain. it will not help me. i want my apartment. i want my computer. i like having my blankets and teddy bear. if i start with the drugs, i will lose it all. and i don't have much as it is. i've fought too fucking hard for too fucking long and i'm not letting them take my teddy bear again. no fucking way. i don't want to die. i am not a quitter. i have pride. i am a fighter, period. it's just what i do. there is no solution for me. i must be okay with a lot of wrong things. i must be okay with a lot of misunderstanding, a lot of cold shoulders, a lot of angry whispers, a lot of rejection, a lot of jealousy, a lot of inaccurate judgments. i must be patient. i must remeber what's important at all times. i must follow my steps that i have written for myself, steps to appraise what's important, to help myself keep perspective. i know sometimes thing can blow up and get bigger only in my head, and it's up to me to deflate the monster and bring it down to size. i must forgive myself, for all my mistakes, for all my fear responses. i am trying, afterall, making huge effort in the face of overwhelming odds and impossible, lose-lose situations. i give myself mad credit, even when no one else does. i give myself tons of praise. i know that breaking everything up is not going to fix it. i know that a fantastic display of fear, anxiety, and anger will not fix it. i hold on instead. i hold on and do nothing, nothing but try to think and plan and strategize how i want to go about getting a version of what i need, how i can become satisfied with getting much less than what i need, how i can make only a tiny bit of help work for me. These are all things my old therapist taught me. He is responsible for showing me how to intergrate adult behavior into my schizophrenic, frightened, shattered, immature, limited mind. I needed someone to go slow, to explain to me slowly how to function, how people function out there in the real world. He did this. He talked slowly, and answered my questions without incredulousness at my stupidity. He told me jokes that i could understand when I was sad and needed to laugh. He let me cry when I felt sad. He let me stop when I needed to rest. He let me go when I needed to keep going. I don't know why he ""saw"" me, when no one else could ever seem to. I want to ask him why he is different. Maybe I am a bit obessessed with him, but I don't want to hurt him. I am just in a lot of pain, and he's helped me when I was in so much pain before. I keep thinking that maybe he can help me again. That's all.",

I feel so selfish for wanting to die, I've made so many suicide plans, but how can I leave everyone behind with my mess, of cleaning up after me? I wish something would happen so that I didnt have to make it happen, because I just can't face anything anymore.

I don't want to self pity, I don't want to anything anymore. I just want to disappear and have nobody even notice. i don't want to feel anymore. Why can't that happen? Why couldn't I just be normal and happy like an average person? i can't talk to anybody about it because people just get mad at me for feeling this way.

Why shouldn't I just give into it I mean it's obvious I'm a loser who can't hide that from anyone. Backstory Recently like a couple days ago I was feeling the best I've felt since I went into depression. I made a few strides and it looked like that I might finally have gotten over it. I even made a few promises and kept them until today when I broke them and gave into my urges and I feel like complete shit. I've been building courage to get through the day and keep on keeping on. I'm wondering now for what? Why can't I just build enough courage to end the pain and never have to deal with any of this anymore. I'm not much for professional help unless I can keep it under wraps from my Parents it just isn't possible for me. Is there any hope fore me?

Made me see I have a future, well, I signed for Infantry, my plan for the future is to die in combat. I just don't know if I can last that long. I just hate everything. I'm not fat, or ugly, or anything. I'm from a middle class divorced family with a dad who hates me and a mom trying to make up for all the shit she did to my siblings and I. But I just keep thinking about how the Marine Corps is going to take to long to die, I don't even know if it will make me happier. I might end up on fucking suicide watch during boot camp. My theory is that the average American Male, Goes to college for a degree that they hope will get them a job, gets a job they'll end up hating, buy a middle class house with a mortgage lasting till retirement, get divorced after having a few kids, kids will end up hating them, or they will hate their kids, turn to alcohol to ease the pain, get some form of cancer, and die an old fuck that can't wipe his ass. That is the American Dream. That is all we have to look forward to. How is that a happy ending? Why should I stay alive to experience this?

I smoke cigarettes but I quit in 3 days when it's the 2 month marker for boot. I'm in great shape, extremely strong and cut, everyone says I look good. If i wanted to I could have a girlfriend easily and many friends. But I hate everyone. I also have ""Paranoia"" is what my ex said it was. I don't fear it at all, but every time I leave my house no matter who I'm with or where I go, I always think someone is going to attack me and try to kill me. It puts me on edge. I'm rambling, no one will even probably bother reading this. I hope someone does and can help even in the slightest bit.

128,life beyond our control We can't control others only ourselves...how I wish this were completely true. If I could control myself instead of being controlled by others I would say F*ck off when someone took advantage of me instead of crying. If I had control of myself I would think of the perfect comeback when someone said something cruel instead of gaping at them like a idiot. I wouldn't hesitate to negotiate if I knew they wouldn't play fair. If I'd known that marriage was a slave contract for a woman then I would've reveled in my freedom to determine my life without the blackmail of love. If I'd known that working in retail meant rolling in humiliation for a tiny paycheck I would've prostituted myself for better wages elsewhere. In the end I lose.

133,"Coping with a suicide loss One learns to live with the loss, the tragedy, the waste, and the gaping hole in the fabric of one's life. There is no closure, nor would I want one. I want to remember him all my life, vividly: his laughter, the smell of his sneakers under his bed, his moments of joy, his humility, and his integrity. Some survivors struggle with what to tell other people. Although you should make whatever decision feels right to you, most survivors have found it best to simply acknowledge that their loved one died by suicide. You may find that it helps to reach out to family and friends. Because some people may not know what to say, you may need to take the initiative to talk about the suicide, share your feelings, and ask for their help. Even though it may seem difficult, maintaining contact with other people is especially important during the stress-filled months after a loved one's suicide. Keep in mind that each person grieves in his or her own way. Some people visit the cemetery weekly; others find it too painful to go at all. Each person also grieves at his or her own pace; there is no set rhythm or timeline for healing. Anniversaries, birthdays, and holidays may be especially difficult, so you might want to think about whether to continue old traditions or create some new ones. You may also experience unexpected waves of sadness; these are a normal part of the grieving process. Children experience many of the feelings of adult grief, and are particularly vulnerable to feeling abandoned and guilty. Reassure them that the death was not their fault. Listen to their questions, and try to offer honest, straightforward, age-appropriate answers. Some survivors find comfort in community, religious, or spiritual activities, including talking to a trusted member of the clergy. Be kind to yourself. When you feel ready, begin to go on with your life. Eventually starting to enjoy life again is not a betrayal of your loved one, but rather a sign that you've begun to heal. Why Did This Happen? Many survivors struggle to understand the reasons for the suicide, asking themselves over and over again: ""Why?"" Many replay their loved ones' last days, searching for clues, particularly if they didn't see any signs that suicide was imminent. Because suicide is often poorly understood, some survivors feel unfairly victimized by stigma. They may feel the suicide is somehow shameful, or that they or their family are somehow to blame them for this tragedy. But you should know that 90 percent of all people who die by suicide have a diagnosable psychiatric disorder at the time of their death (most often depression or bipolar disorder). Just as people can die of heart disease or cancer, people can die as a consequence of mental illness. Try to bear in mind that suicide is almost always complicated, resulting from a combination of painful suffering, desperate hopelessness and underlying psychiatric illness. Helping Children Cope Children are particularly vulnerable to feeling abandoned and guilty. Listen to their questions, and try to offer honest, straightforward, age-appropriate answers. Survivors frequently seek advice about how to explain suicide to children. Here are some suggestions: When you have a choice, tell them as soon as you have the news, in a place where both you and they will feel comfortable. Reassure them that the death was not their fault. Explain that their loved one died of an illness -- a brain illness. For example: ""Daddy had something like a heart attack except it was a 'brain attack."" Resist the urge to keep the suicide a secret out of fear that the child will copy the behavior of the deceased. Just as families with hypertension, diabetes or heart disease are educated about early warning signs and prevention, relatives of suicide victims need to understand the early warning signs of depression and other mental illnesses so they can obtain proper treatment. Reassure them that you, together with other appropriate adults will take care of them. Let them know they can approach you at any time if they want to talk about it. Children may express their feelings by crying, withdrawing, laughing, or expressing anger at you or others. Or, they may not. Simply let them know you are available for whatever they need -- now or at some later time. Resume and maintain the child's regular routine as much as possible. The greatest gift you can give children is your assurance of love and support. Allow them to express their feelings, answer their questions and provide them with affection.",
134,"been a while hey there to all of you. i am sorry i haven't been on in so long to check on you all. my life has basically fallen apart - yes even worse than what it was doing before. basically we moved into the new house- i was in the hospital most of the of the first month of course and ""he"" decided he couldn't take it anymore. actually that was his cop-out. he had been dating someone else. so he kicked me out - of my own freaking house! nice. so i actually did it- i attempted - obviously failed which has been the hardest part to deal with. the failure. i can cope with the fact that i'm supposed to be here and it didn't work for a reason but the fact that i failed at something i was pretty sure about as far as knowing what i was doing really kicks me in the gut. i was in the hospital for a few weeks and then had to go through an intensive partial in-patient hospitalization - basically intense group therapy. anyway - had to move back in with my mom...which i hate. can't raise my son like i want and now the ex is fighting me for custody, i lost my job...AND i am leaving the state for a month again for another shot at the surgery that i had last year to see if i can get some relief. the drs don't know what to do with me and are as sick of me as i am of them. anyway...my son is in here wanting some attention so i better go. i just wanted to give an update as to what has been going on the past 3-4 months. i hope you are all okay and i promise to check in with you all more often now that i have so much free time. later - getitout",
135,"Expressing it...finally. Yah I think I do need to talk about how I am feeling. I haven't been able to really tell anyone about it, or at least how I truly feel. I think about suicide every day. My mom killed her self when I was ten years old and my father left me right when I was born. Everyone that knows me and knows my life has said they don't know anyone else who has had a harder life than me. I am 24 now and lived a life of constant drug abuse for ten years following my moms death. So when I was 20 I got sober and for a while life seemed to get better but this past year has just been the worst. I mean even though I am doing positive things with my life I feel like the time I spend thinking about suicide just keeps increasing. Some days I estimate I spend 4 plus hours a day thinking about it. It has become almost a fantasy and I imagine all the ways I could do it and think about every detail in the process. Its like a movie playing in my head on low volume all the time and I even imagine my suicide while listening to people talk and laughing and going about my normal day. If I were to look at my life on a written paper I wouldn't even believe a person could go on living like this. But something deep down inside me keeps me alive somehow. No matter how much time I spend contemplating suicide I have always known that I couldn't do it. I think this is partly because my mom did it and I saw how bad it hurt everyone around her and that is what stops me. Its like a deep down subconscious knowing that just KNOWS I am not going to do it and I have had it my whole life. Lately though I have noticed myself distancing myself from my close loved ones and I am starting to wonder if this means I might actually do it. Anyway I have these blocks that don't allow me to appear weak to people so no one really knows this is going on. I thought I wasn't ever going to tell anyone but then it hit me that I could just do it anonymously on a forum and maybe it might help. So here is my attempt to to express myself and see if it helps. Thanks for listening.",
136,"Ideas? Lately I have been having a lot of troubling thoughts of wanting to commit suicide. But, have made no steps or actions in carrying it out. However, I realize these feelings are not normal, and I am afraid of the potential downward spiral effect. When I was a kid, I had these feelings when my parents divorced and when my dad was remarried. I was a verbally and mentally abused child; where I was also molested by my brother from the time I was 6, until I was 14 (when he moved away). I have since beat the huge odds stacked against me and (from what I thought) over came these feelings I had once felt. I am a young one to say the least, just barely 20 years old. I own a few corporations, operate a budget of over 8.15 million dollars a year. I feel overwhelmed in making these business work, and make as much money as possible. Even though the company makes a lot of money, it also owes a lot of it too. To date the companys owe just about 6.8 million dollars, mostly because of equipment and buildings. And, you have to pay taxes, labor, insurance, yadda yadda yadda. It all adds up. The business' is ok, just barely paying everyone and making its loan payments. I feel like a failure, even though a lot of people look at me, and say wow, he is doing great. Have the car, house, dog, boat, etc. I just feel like giving up and quitting. I personally have no debt owed to anyone. Thats all fine, but... the business is another story. I know business owe money when they first start up, but... is this pressure normal? I feel like I am ready to crack, and I dont want to admit I am a quack. My head feels like its going to explode. I just recently bought another rental unit, bringing me to 6 duplexes and my house. Now another payment to deal with, two more tenats to deal with, etc.... To top it all off I have unexplained headaches and take muscle relaxers for it. Only makes me sleepy. Which makes more work for me, thus another headache...an on... an on...! I have had an MRI and besides the unusually large brain, I am fine. But... I dont think I am. I have been breaking into cold sweats, cant sleep, neck and back hurt, and a constant headache. And a slight pain in my chest. Maybe I'll get lucky and die in my sleep. That would be better than my fourtne cookie I got with lunch! Sometimes I just think for once in my life I would finially be able to take the easy way out. I came from nothing, to where I am today. Am I at least alotted a one time free pass? Or do I still owe it to those that want to see me fail (grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc). Do I still show them up, or... give up and give in. Any ideas?",
137,"What to expect when telling a therpist you're suicidal? So, I've avoided posting in this part of the forumn for awhile, just 'cause it makes the idea of suicide feel more... real. But I'm curious and want some answers. I'm not currently in therapy but when I was, my therapist asked me if I was suicidal. I lied. I was under 18 and assumed they would have to tell my parents, and I couldn't have that. But lets say, hypothetically, I go back to therapy, now that I'm 18, but I am still living with my parents. And I tell them I am suicidal and self-harm. Would they still tell my parents? Would they tell anyone else? My school? And what if they thought it was pretty serious, like if I had a plan? Would they send me off to a psych hospital? Or could I just talk regularly with my therapist about my feelings?",
138,"Loneliness Hey everyone. It's my first time writing. I'm 31 and living alone, never had a real girlfriend, just a couple of dates. It tears me up to see all my friends married or with someone and i'm all alone... Sometimes when i fell real lonley i think about suecide. I allmost came real close to doing it once and because i work in a chemical lab it is very easy for me to do it. I'm tring to stay positive but it's just not working. I tried to go to a psychologist but it didn't help me. Every day that passes by is very painfull and sad. i'm so scares of waking up one day at 40 years old and still being single.",
139,"Worthless/want to die I am failing at everything in my life. Being a mother a wife a sister and a daughter and a nurse. I have major depressive disorder,PTSD, panic disorder, And showing signs of borderline personality disorder. I am 35 years old I'm mother of two daughters. My husband does not support me he thinks I'm crazy. When I was 17 I was raped. I kept it to myself and received no help. When my first child was born I had postpartum depression really bad... I now understand why some women killed their children. Luckily I had the strength enough to keep myself away from her when having thoughts of hurting her. I hated myself for having those thoughts, but am glad that God got me through each day. Besides an anti depressant I got through on my own. When my second child came it was opposite I wanted to kill myself. I attempted when she was 2 months. Since I have been hospitalized once more (she is almost 3). I slowly started having problems at work losing focus memory loss then breakdowns and panic attacks. We've tried multiple medication combinations therapy counseling etc., Nothing seems to be helping. I am afraid that I might accidentally hurt one of my patients, Make a medication error. I had noticed slowly that I've been losing vocabulary, which makes my job as a nurse that much harder. I have not been a very good decision-maker it's even worse now. I have no right actively working as a nurse. I don't qualify for FMLA, and don't have short term disability. I need to work, my family could not survive without me working. So I'm out of options. I'm hurting my girls with my behavior. They either see me sad or constantly angry frustrated all the time. My husband doesn't support me and he wants to leave. I have no right living and messing up so many lives. How dare I make my own child resent me because I can't get out of bed. Or my little one ask me multiple times in a day "" mommy are you sad"". I'm a pathetic piece of worthless crap. I see no hope. My faith is gone. Each day is so painful for me to bare, that I want to die. I will die!",
140,"Weird I read something on someone's blog, and it kinda stuck with me. I don't want to commit suicide, I don't want to kill myself, but, I wish I could just be dead It's a terribly confusing feeling/thought, but somehow that's how it is. Of course I can't be dead without committing suicide, but I wish that somehow it would be possible. Realising this, I begun to feel stuck. Between wanting to die but not being able to kill myself, and going on and on and on and continue living like a zombie. What to do?!?! I wish I could just dissolve and be gone.",
141,"Scared? Whenever I come to the point that I'm thinking suicide I always end up in this dilemma. I'm scared to do it, yet I want to. If that makes sence? I'm scared of leaving my family more devastated then they already are I'm scared of no one caring, except my family But I would finally relax... I'm not thinking of ever doing it. Mainly because I'm scared of ^^. I believe that I'll live a new life. How? I don't know. This is just my thoughts when I eventually think of it... Is it suppouse to be like this?",
142,"Lost again When I was 14 I had severe depression because things aren't always easy in life and I guess I had bad luck. I had many thoughts about killing myself and ending all that inevitable pain, but the thought of leaving my mom behind, to leave her alone just made me stick around. Then I got better, I realised I had much to live for. Now, it's been 5 years and I'm starting to think a lot about that a lot, again. Whenever I get drunk, which never used to happen, I just... I feel it so intensely, I just don't want to live anymore. I had good things in my life, but everything goes to waste everytime. I'm not sure what to do, I just need peace",

145,"No self worth left I first want to say I never knew how truly stupid I was, how lacking in self worth, self respect and values. I am quite simply nothing. I seriously don't know how to continue on just surviving after yesterday. I hit rock bottom again but it's lower than I have ever sunken before. Mum says that there is only up now. If she knew how much I threw my pride away yesterday, I'm sure she would denounce me once again as her daughter, claim her contempt for my lack of courage and any self pride. I didn't go to work yesterday was having another mental break down. It's all been too much, my mum is dying, my nephew is dying of cancer and I'm quite pathetically still in love with my ex boyfriend. 6 months later he still says he loves me but is not in love and that he wants to be friends. All I did yesterday was smoke, cry and sleep. I laid in bed in the darkness thinking of ways to end it all. I either rang or texted various members of my family crying out that I wanted to die. If that wasn't bad enough I ended up continually texting my ex, all of my self pride went down from there. I asked him if he was in love with me (how fucking stupid!!!) he said he didn't love me that way anymore. How I wish the stupidity ended there. I then asked him if he could grant me one last favour and hold me one more time. I said I didn't want to be alone that night. He said he didn't think that was healthy for either of us. Of course he said no...he doesn't fucking love me....how fucking brain dead am I?!?!!! I asked him just to leave me alone, that I was hurting beyong belief and just wanted to end it all. He wouldn't stop texting me back and said he would ring the police if I did anything to myself. He wanted me to swear I would not try anything. I told him no, that once I get the balls I'm going to do it. I cringe, here is this poor guy who's only mistake is that he dated me for a year. Who now only feels tringes of pity for a mentally fucked up girl that just wants to die. I still want to die. I am humiliated beyond belief. I am my own worse enemy and don't think I could ever look him in the eye again. Oh how I wished when he broke up with me, I just said okay and went into no contact and stuck it out. At least then I would of had some pride, that would of been of some solace. I am fucked but what hurts is that now he knows how much, and who was once a lover is now my enemy and I have let him see how weak I am, how worthless and how pathetic. He talks to me now like a mentally deranged person, soft tones, sad smile and sympathetic eyes. He once adored me, now I'm nothing. His little neice was born yesterday and the picture my mind paints of him holding her kills me. He will never hold our baby. He use to talk of marriage and children but he will share his future with someone else not me. Not me. Yes I want to die and figure if the people around me really loved me they would be happy to see me not fight any more with my darkness. Yesterday showed me that I am truly alone in my pain. I am surrounded by family but distant from everyone. I won't talk about my despair to them anymore...whats the point they can't do anything about it and it just upsets them. I don't believe in anything anymore. I have tried so many ways to stop loving someone who doesn't love me. Researched the internet, unsuccessfully tried no contact (but thats hard working with him), read books, tired to change my perception of the event, tried to hate him, tried to think of him as dead...I have tried in so many ways to go on. I'm not wanting to die for him. I want to die for me. Like I said to him you have 25 years of fighting depression than talk to me. I believe in God but don't believe he loves me. I have cried my tears to him, pleaded and begged, got angry and shouted but mostly just wept and asked him to help me accept and move on. I woke up this morning, once again. And all I want to do is die.",
146,"I've had enough. I want to die. I honestly just want to die. I've had enough of everything. My life is just pointless.

I'm hideous, and I'm not just saying this because I have 'low self-esteem', I really am hideous. Today someone even told me I look like that Saw clown from the movie! My weight is piling on, I just can't stop myself from eating crap. When I have a bad day, I turn straight to the cuboards and eat! Personallity? I don't have one of them either, I'm like a creepy little robot. I'm not funny, witty, charismatic, or even smart. It's not fair! I should be revising, I've got exams in like a month, and instead I'm here! And if I get any lower than a B on my exam I'm going to look like an absolute fool! Arrggg I don't know what to do. And I keep getting this weird feeling, i can't explain it though. Whenever I get it, I just want to die there and then. It's horrible, it's just so.. strange. That's the only word I can possibly think of to describe it. I don't even know why I've came here. All I'm doing is burdening others with my petty little problems. Arg I'm only 14! Why is this happening to me? I wish I was never born! I know my mum would prefer if I was dead, I know it! I'm always annoying her with my little problems. I always upset her when she see's how much I've mutilated my wrists. I'm an actual freak, the other day I got really frustrated because of my huge 'quagmire' chin, that I tried to cut it off.

This past week, my levels of anxiety have been increasing and while I'm right now, at this very moment, not planning to do anything...rash, Im afraid that the suicidal thoughts are starting to gain alot of ground in my mind. Im finding myself thinking back to self harming too often. Thinking that I shouldn't bother trying anything anymore because something always seems to go wrong. Family is not the least bit supportive. I find myself wanting to go home less and less. And everytime I'm there, there is almost always something that they complain about me. I work, I help pay bills, buy food, keep things running as smoothly as posible. But one slip, one moment of getting angry and suddenly nothing I do matters. I try to reason, try to explain but they just keep throwing excuse after excuse at me. I confront them and they lie, I help them and they abuse. I want to get out but can't, I try to remain calm but the feelings of desperation, of wanting to give up grow. Why should I keep trying? Why do everything I can to help if they're always going to put me down? Always going to find some flaw in me, something to complain about? What more do I have to do? Do I have to resort to more extreme measures? Do I have to no longer be there for them to realize what their doing? I hate how hypothetical they all are. Everyone acts all concern when something extreme happens. Back in November, when I was in a car crash that should have killed me, everyone was all sobs and ""are you ok""? Yet here I am, lucky to be alive let alone standing on my feet, trying to make things work and they complain. Do I really have to die for them to see? Is that what it will take for them to snap out of their idiotic states of mind? Because everyone sure as hell seems to get over themselves when death comes knocking.",

Everybody lost all respect for me and they told me there was nothing I could do, or should. I saw a therapist and it was one of the worst experiences of my life and I was only further convinced that killing myself was a better option. I've mis-worded it so much that it seemed like a completely different problem, so everybody assumed that the problem was with me. Life probably won't be worth it once I graduate from high school. My depression is lowering my grades and I'd rather be done with depression, but my depression won't end, as long as I live in the same house and go to the same school.

Now the depression is resurfacing and I'm going to therapy and have just started going to a depression group, while also taking medication. The dogs don't let me or my family members sleep, and I already called animal control, and apparently they sent the neighbors a warning, but they continued to let their dogs bark. My mother also went to them to calmly ask them to do something about it, and it did work for one day, but afterwards the dogs were allowed to bark again and again. This situation has made me hate the system. Why must they make it so hard for me to solve this problem. I can log the barking times and such and send them the papers, and they will cite the neighbor, BUT the neighbor can challenge the citation and receive information about the log I filled out, including my NAME and ADDRESS. So if I go this route, I am assured to have bad relations with my neighbors, and the man who responded to my mother that day she went to them was extremely defensive and just an angry person. I fear for a strong retaliation from him. I've also called 311, and they said that they can't help. If I call the police, which I doubt would be effective for something like this, the neighbors will know because the officers would come to our home after talking to the neighbors. So now it's come to this. I don't want to stay up in the long hours of the night, thinking of my already worsening depressive thoughts, being FORCED to think about them as I hear the loud ringing of the barking... I'm weak, yes I know. Something like this shouldn't be worth taking my life for. BUT IM WEAK. I can't deal with it anymore. The despair I feel when I also think about how my parents are affected from this is unbearable. My father already has sleeping issues and has to go to work at five in the morning every day. The headaches throughout the day, the stress, the fact that I'm undecided about what I want to do, if I want to continue college or not... I'm sorry but I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I don't want to go to that mental ward again as well.. That was horrible. If I call the police talking about wanting to kill myself... ILL BE PUT THERE AGAIN... I hate it there... I'll be left behind again and delay myself from having a good future yet again.. I hate that noise. That demonic, brain-twisting chorus of Satan's own hounds makes me wish I were gone from this world. This post may be ignored, edited away, destroyed... Who knows. But if there's someone out there that can help, please... This is destroying my mind..",
156,thoughts i just want my world to end right now whats the point in any of it? sick and tired of all this crap.. im not getting better.. no-one can help me. stupid docs cant help me had appt with care co-ordinator today.. pointless.. i still dont know whats happening- he needs to talk to therapist to see if he can find one thats willing to meet me. then he will get back to me.. pointless cus i closed up.. he says im unaproachable sometimes cus i look down and dont talk- people have to make effort to talk to me and find out about me.. and i need to be able to change that. f**!* off.. ive been like this my whole life.. i cant just turn around and be this whole new confident person.. it aint gonna happen. they want me to 'deal with things' how the heck can i.. i dont know what it is i need to deal with... i can open up.. theres just a horrible feeling in me... too many thoughts that i can even talk about.. they prob think im fine and everythings ok.. i just lack confidence.. NOT TRUE... i know theres something more than that.. i fi was fine i wouldnt feel how i do and think of the things i think about. wish there was a fly on the wall or ppl could read my mind sometimes... just so someone could see the 'real me' whatever that is. cant happen tho... docs will never know... im screwed... why bother with therapy... i get nothing from it anyway everything in this life is just pointless.. wish i had more courage .. i want this pain to stop once and for all so many bad thoughts in my head right now :(,
157,"today today was a bad day. had an allergy attack. put me out for almost the whole day. losing my will to deal with it. actually lost my will a long time ago, but trying to find strength to keep going. got crazy, got violent. can't talk too much about it. brain is a fucking mess. allergies make it worse, a lot worse. feel awful. something snapped. attacked people, threw things, slammed doors hard, broke front door. neighbors saw me, i saw them watching. awful. they know there is something wrong with me. i can almost hear them talking. brain can't stay still, keeps changing. maybe sick. high libido, many ideas, confidence, shining, talking. talking way too much about things i should not be talking about at all. way too revealing, no privacy, sexual indiscretion. huge plans and schemes involving desire. now more clear, coming down, realizing what i did. regretting, feeling shame, feeling fear. what did i say again? how bad did it get? bad, this time. too much, way too far gone. getting worse. have to eat more, have to sleep more, have to ground energy, come back down. today: suicide. visions: hanging. can't go there, but want to, very badly. i am sick, a burden. harmful to family. harmful to children. sick and never going to get well. better off without me. don't need this kind of mother. would be better if i was dead. suicide: closer. can't keep going like this. life is torture. have to get out.",
158,Depressed and bad thoughts Hi I am new here. I am hoping to get some help for my bad thoughts and maybe some better answers than ending my life. I know you all aren't professionals but sometimes just sharing my thoughts seems to help. This is my first time here. Never have been to a depression or suicide forum. So here it goes. I have not been diagnosed with depression. I have have bouts of feeling depressed since I was a kid (I am almost 23 now). I was picked on in grade school so my self esteem is low. My mother is an aloholic. I have been getting help through alanon (like AA but for family members). Which has helped tremendously. I started going to a counselor in September which helped my anxiety. I never told her about my suicidal thoughts though. I know I should but hiding it is so much easier. The first time I felt suicidal I was about 16. My mothers alcoholism was getting worse and her marriage was failing. I lost my childhood dog and grandpa in the same month. I also was dealing with problems with people at school. Things got better once I graduated high school and moved out of my moms with my now husband. Suicidal thoughts started back after I had started the birth control Nuvaring after having my first child. I think it may have been related. I was dealing with stress over being a new mother and we were buying a house. I started having vivid dreams of how I would do it. I would have hallucination of seeing myself or someone doing it. It was scary. I don't know what triggered me at that point in my life to be thinking that way. I was happily married and had a beautiful little girl so I shouldnt be thinking that way. I decided to get off the birth control and it helped. I talked to my husband about my thoughts and it was the first time i had opened up about that type of stuff. Things started getting better once we moved in to our new house and were more financially stable. My relationship with my mother is not so great. Two months ago I got into a big argument with her. I told her she had the choice between the alcohol and her daughter and if she didnt get some help she wouldnt be able to come around. I let her come to my daughters bday party last week and have been talking off and on with her. But I feel so lonely. Not just because of less contact with her. But also less contact with my entire family. My family doesn't get along. So I feel so pushed away from them and im sad. I have awesome inlaws but I feel so shy around them and like i have to be someone im not. I feel lonely because I don't have that many close female friends. I have been thinking about suicide more lately but I know I couldnt do it to my husband and kids. I know they would not make it without me. but this sadness is killing me inside. I want people to like and love me. I want to be appreciated and cared about. I just hope i can be happy again. I thought I would be happy not having my mom around as much but the truth is im not. I am very sad. Thanks for listening..,
159,"havent posted in awhile i posted once here a long time ago, and now im back. Ive been doing really wel for about a year, but recently, i started feeling depressed and hopeless again. it seems like no matter what i do im not happy any more. Ive been really lonely lately, as i dont have many friends. I think all i need is someone to talk to.....",
160,"how much more can i take? so i have dealt with depression all of my life, im 30. It got worse about 2 1/2 years ago. I was in a lawsuit against my former employer over the fact of what i was dealing with mentally that caused me to get fired. About 4 months ago my bride to be called it off, a week later had another man living with her and her 3 kids. And couple weeks ago received a letter of their marriage cert in the mail addressed to me. I spent a few days in mental ward back in march voluntarily. I have quit taking the meds they prescribed me. I can't function in life on these meds. And without the meds i feel even more lost mentally. I feel stuck in neutral with nowhere to go. I know there is alot i want to accomplish with what life i have left, but don't feel that any of it is necessary at the moment. I had so much and lost all of it so fast. which way is up?",
161,"fibromyalgia makes me turn away from people. i am avoiding a friend. because i have fibromyalgia and i can not hear from one more person how they think i am lying about my symptoms. a friend is supposed to believe what i say and not question me. a friend is supposed to be supportive no matter what. i can not take that risk and call her because what if she says, ""i saw you running and seemed fine to me."" fibromyalgia is weird like that. one moment i can walk and the next i'm too tired or i'm in too much pain. it is the nature of fibromyalgia. and when my friends get angry and testy with me, i don't appreciate the hostility in tone. i am in agony most of the time with this damn fibromyalgia and to opne the door to a friend is dangerous, is risky to me because a friend can hurt you; they can hurt you with an ignorant comment that hits squarely your sore spots. a friend is someone you've shared your weaknesses with and so if that friend decides to turn on you, they can hold up your sore spot and really stick it to you. that is what i am afraid of. and i am too fragile right now to even try, to even take that chance. because she may turn out to be very understanding. but i can not take that chance because then i will be hurt and cry and be upset. no one understands how painful this fibromyalgia is for me. no one understands how angry i am that i feel so terrible all time. no one understands the grief and feelings of loss and sadness over this fibromyalgia, as the fibro has taken away my spontanaety. instead of my friends showing compassion for me and my suffering, the get angry at me and call me a liar instead. i do not need that. i don't understand fibromyalgia either; i don't know why i can walk sometimes and other times i can't. all i know is that i hurt and i feel crappy almost all of the time. i am definitely sensitive about this fibromyalgia. don't anyone question me, i want to yell. i tell you the truth: when i say it hurts, it hurts. i put this in the suicide form because i sincerely believe i will kill myself over this fibromyalgia one day.",
162,"Tired I migrated from the depression forums, now to the suicide forum. I am just flat out tired. You know I've had many days like this, I've been to institutions, forums, & things got better for a second, just to crumble and fall back down which tells me that my life will never get better, so I'm think about just taking my life. The reason why I won't is because I don't want to go to the lower depths.. I might though...I've hit rock bottom today...So, we'll see.. People look at this as a problem, but it's just for people who feel like they can't take it anymore..I mean we were basically forced to live. We didn't ask to be born, selfish or not. It was selfish of a parent to want 6 kids & not think twice about what the kid might want in life, much less give it to them. Don't try to talk me out of it, I just needed to vent. It's pointless & no one will ever get it. I'm done you know.",
163,"Life's a burden I woke this morning wishing i was dead as i do most days because the emotional pain i feel is unbearable. I wish i had something to numb the pain just some relief from my problems that i cannot solve. I don't do drugs although i now understand why ones do, i drink to forget the pain but just feel worse after, and i don't have the guts to take my own life. I exist now only to die- i yearn for death and each day is a burden to me, a hindrance. I stay alive only to shield others from the pain of my suicide, although i do believe that life goes on for those left. Yes there's pain and sorry, but relief for those gone. No-one wants to take their life for no reason, but what other solutions are there when life is too much?",

166,"I am being constantly ignored by the pretty ladies I am constantly being ignored by good-looking ladies and this is making me very depressed and suicidal. I get absolutely zero attention from good-looking ladies and this is making me depressed and is making me want to end my miserable life.

174,"Stressed beyond my limits A few years back I lost my job due to back problems, I have spinal stenosis coupled with 2 bulging disks. That combined with the fact that for the previous 10 years I had been a truck driver so my back was taking a beating while being seated and unmoving for such long periods of time cause the muscles in that area of my back to atrophy. It started slowly I found I was in pain when I had to stand or walk for more than few minutes, but instead of taking time off of work to get it checked I simply reduced how much i stood or walked in order to keep working. This facilitated a nasty cycle where the less I did the more weight I gained, the more weight I gained the more pain I was in so I did less. Eventually I could no longer perform the required tasks for the job and had to leave, I had disability insurance and that kicked in because the doctors stated I could no longer do the job. Doctors that I went to took the approach of pain management and instead focused on my weight, they were sure that i had heart problems, so sure that even when a stress test came back fine they still order a heart cath. The doctor that performed the procedure said that I had the heart of a teenager, nothing wrong. Doctors still could only see my weight when i went to them and ignored my back, they went so far as to order me physical therapy which was a miserable failure, it put me in so much pain that for every day I spent doing it i spent 2 days unable to do much more than sit in pain and not move. By this time i no longer had medical coverage but since i am a veteran the VA covers me for that but their care is more of the same, manage the pain (100mg of Tramadol 4 times per day, 1600mg methocarbamol 4 times per day 30mg meloxicam twice a day). This has gone on over the past 3 years, during this time I lost the relationship that I had been in for the last 10 years including the 2 kids of hers that I considered my own, I lost my license and vehicle because I didnt have the money to keep the vehicle nor the energy/inclination to renew the license, and was forced to move. Through it all I had been being supported by the small monthly check I get from the disability insurance, they also started my disability claim which has been turned down twice because they state that I can still work if I do so seated, they fail to take into account that with exception of a recliner at the house that I have cushions duct taped in the perfect places I can not sit in any other chairs for more than 15-20 min before the pain gets to be bad enough that I need to move. I dont sleep well either, 2-3 hours max at a time before the pain wakes me up and i have to go sit in the recliner, so my days are a constant cycle of sleep until pain is more than i can sleep through then sit up until the exhaustion out weighs the pain. The disability company retained a law firm that specializes in disability claims and they have gotten me a hearing for my appeal. This brings me to now, I live in a house with a roommate, he helps as he can with taking me places when he isnt working, the house is rural so no public transportation is available, I am about a month out from my hearing and stressing out over it cause I fear if it is denied then my source of income will go leaving me homeless and hopeless. Having spent the majority of the past 15 years on the road doing long haul trucking the only friends I have are online ones in far away places and family is not an option for help, all of this has me thinking about an exit strategy to end the pain, suffering and stress.",

176,"empty I think about killing myself all the time; I lose time at work thinking about it. I know I need help, but I can't talk about it. I only have one friend, and she's great, but I don't want to tell her because I don't want her to blow the whistle. I hate phones - I'm not comfortable with them in any way, so calling a hotline is not something i'll do. I tried emailing the samaritans, but it didn't help; I don't have anything much to say, and I just didn't feel any kind of connection. Ultimately, I found it more frustrating and fake-feeling than anything else... which is not to disparage the people on the other end who are trying to help. They didn't do anything wrong, it's just the consequences of me knowing too much psychology and how to 'deal' with someone who's suicidal. I don't even have any real hope that posting here will help, but I can't seem to stop reaching out. As I said, I think about killing myself all the time. Nothing particularly bad or stressful is going on in my life. There is no trigger. I have clinical depression that goes in cycles, and has as far back as I can remember. I'm never really happy, but I sink into a deep depression about once a month. It's not uncommon for me to contemplate suicide during this time. I've had a plan of one kind or another since I was 16. I don't self-harm though -- i don't feel any relief through pain. The depression has been getting worse though, and this time, even though i'm not in my 'slump' anymore, I still want to die. I just don't see the point of me being alive. I don't contribute anything, I'm not a particularly nice person, I don't have the drive to do anything great. I spend a lot of time complaining and projecting my own inadequacies onto others. I used to enjoy reading, but now I mostly do it because I have nothing else to do. i tried looking for classes or clubs in my area, but there is nothing reachable in my time and budget. I'm extremely lonely; the one friend I mentioned is 2 hours away. I talk to my coworkers at the office, but not as much as most people, and I don't really get to know them. I'm 32, and most people at work are older or younger than me. The ones who are my age aren't interested in making friends because they're busy with their own lives/families. I've tried online dating, but I get either a) creepy people who obviously didn't read my profile and only want a one-night stand, or b) people who seem cool, but then seem too cool, so I can't bring myself to message/ meet them because they'll only be disappointed. i've lost my sex drive, but I really just want someone to hold and love. I haven't changed in all these years, despite knowing I need to and wanting to, so I've realized that at this point, it's clear I never will change. The thought of being alone and unchanging like this for another 30 years brings me to tears. I've started giving things away in preparation. I'm not in any rush, but I don't think I can go another year.",
177,Just about ready to do it. I have been depressed for 30+ years. I tried to find happiness. I gave it my best shot I really can't wait until I die.....NO DAY ON EARTH WILL EVER COMPARE TO THE DAY I DIE.,
178,"My severe Depression Well, since this website is all about rambling on about one's problems, I guess I'll have my say. I'm a clinically depressed person who's phased in and out of sadness for as long as I can remember. I'm depressed and frustrated over my sexuality, appearance, and my future. I guess I can start with the first. when I was thirteen, I was very confused about my sexuality, but I never really cared and ignored the topic until I was fourteen. When I was fourteen, I discovered I was gay and was depressed for it ever since. I used to view it as a horrible thing that I should deserve to die for until around two weeks ago when it just became a bother to me, since it's harder to find a mate, let alone acceptance from people Secondly, my appearance. I was born from an eastern European mother and a UK islander father, although my dad grew up on Kansas city, which makes me the spawn of a redneck oaf. this means that I look subsequently horrid. Don't try to assure me that I'm not ugly, because all of my life I've been told that I'm unattractive, or ugly, that no one would ever sleep with me. The only people who told me that I was attractive were people on the internet who felt a bit sorry for me. My hair is also wretched too. Dead, wavy and curly. The only thing my mother could do to help it was take me to her hair lady, which helped a bit. But honestly, it isn't ever worth the pain that I had to go through for it. It's a waste of time, since I doesn't really even fix anything. I was also born with a bit of a hairy body, mostly on my legs, which I find as ugly as hell. Finally, I have to worry about my pitiful future. what does it hold? probably nothing valuable. I can't think of a future college that I would go to after high school, and I lack so much will that I probably won't even care for high school after a bit. I can't even find living a life of responsibility like that possible, since I'm so unorganized and dependent, I probably wouldn't be able to make it on my own. All of my life, especially now, suicide seems like the only option. all of my problems are either genetic or attached to life, and can't be changed. I've already tried self harm a few times, which were a bit unsuccessful, but sometimes I've been so willing to take my life. To know that if I had to kill myself, that I would totally and completely do it. I wouldn't even care if I died right now at the age of fifteen, at least it would be over with. At least I could be done with myself. I feel like real happiness is something I can't have. I hate myself, and I want to die.",
179,"Undeserving... The last couple of months have been awful. I've been awful. I'm hurting the two people I love most in this world. Let's forget all sexual abuse for a moment. My brother is in so much trouble and I can't be there for him. I should have helped him a long time ago. I was naive and didn't think any of it had an effect on him. Stupid. I can't go back to college because I cut myself and they don't want my kind there. It's not as simple as just stopping. I've tried. Nothing's helped. I've been cutting since I was 10. I can't do it all anymore. I wake up and paint on a mask. Pretending that everything's ok. I try to make it through the day. The nights are the hardest. When I'm completely alone, I scrub off the mask, and the emotions hit me full force in the heart. It's already broken. How small can the pieces shatter? Can they be put back together?

181,"Is there ANY hope for me? Before I start, I shall apologise if this goes on. For my sins I am 42 years old divorced 2 kids. I have been existing with chronic depression since 1999. I used to be an electronics engineer in the royal navy, but was medical released in 2001 ( I won't go into specifics - all I can say is I certainly wouldn't trust my life with the guys I worked with! ) After that I worked in F1, but that didn't work out. My wife was really understanding ( and the day I lost my job she kicked my out of the house - it was only later I discovered she was having an affair with a guy he told her it was ok as long as she converted to his religion of islam !) I then spent every day for the next 5 years looking for jobs - to no joy. I rang Samaritans, and the woman there eventually said to me she would support my decision if I killed myself. You never know you hit rock bottom til the samaritans cannot think of a reason not to commit suicide ! I have sought medical help for the past couple of years, but all it has done is stirred up bad feelings. I am in constant pain. The medication I have to take is only one step down from morphine. The doctors cannot find anything physical wrong with me. My children have both dis-owned me. So basically I am in constant pain, I have no friends, no family, no job, no hope. It is only cowardice that has prevented me from ending it. Even the psychologist I have seen has no answers to my problems. I say all this in the hope that it MIGHT help somebody out there. I pretty much have all the bases covered in terms of reasons to commit suicide. EVERYTHING has been taken away from me. If you feel suicidal - ask yourself this question - have you really hit rock bottom? Have you had as much crap in your life as me? I say I have not hit rock bottom NOT in a positive sense, I just know that I will end up dead in a ditch. ( either by my own hand or by my body giving up ). I haven't told you everything - I probably have completely bored you already. All I want to say is this Whoever you are - whatever you do - you are better than me. You have someone who cares about you (me at the very least for what its worth) I don't have anyone. I feel constant guilt for living when there are more worthy people out there who don't. I am a nothing more than a parasitic drain on the worlds resources. I'm sorry for taking up your time with my inane drivel. I wish you the joy and happiness that I will never receive.",
182,I dont want to do it!!!! Im just sitting here trying to think of a reason not to do it. I already cut my arm and Im trying to keep myself from cutting my wrist.,
183,"7 years later and this is how I feel (rough night)- angry rant-trigger? I never thought that suicide would be the easy way out and I don't think you can quite comprehend the bitter loneliness of that limbo between life and death until you have ""lived"" it. All I remember that day is the numbness. The pain I had been feeling for years had escalated to the point to where I just didn't feel it anymore. I got up, took a shower, drove to 3 different stores so it wouldn't be obvious. I maxed my credit card out buying what I thought would be the last purchases of my life. I don't think I believed that I would do it, until I was sitting there on my bed. I had decided that I really just couldn't take it anymore. I don't care who you talk to or what they say, but no one truly wants to die. I laid down on my pillow and closed my eyes waiting to fall asleep. And as I laid there I began to cry. The finality of what I was doing hit me so hard. I wasn't just ending my life, I was ending my very existence and I felt panic and I felt ashamed. I mean how weak am I that I couldn't even handle just living my life anymore. I had become so weak, I had just given up. Obviously I didn't die because I am sitting here at this very moment, all these years later, writing about something so taboo in my life and yet I still want to die. If god would take me, i would willingly go with him, and these are hard thoughts and feelings to have on a daily basis. So for anyone who wants to spout that people who commit suicide are selfish, I would like to say fuck you! How would you like to live in horrible pain and anguish everyday, feeling like you're a mistake of life, and that the world would be better off if you were dead? But I suppose we're suppose to endure it so loved ones won't be sad or hurt. Well okay, I'll suffer for the next 50 years, sinking deeper and deeper until I am actually one with the scum of the earth and you can go on and live your happy life and be content because you can still be in my company. How is that not fucking selfish?! *guess I am having a hard time tonight and these are just my thoughts for this moment, I hope I didn't offend anyone.",
184,"The Hunter S. Thompson school of thought To quote Thompson's suicide letter: No More Games. No More Bombs. No More Walking. No More Fun. No More Swimming. 67. That is 17 years past 50. 17 more than I needed or wanted. Boring. I am always bitchy. No Fun — for anybody. 67. You are getting Greedy. Act your old age. Relax — This won't hurt. and as a friend of his said: He told me 25 years ago that he would feel real trapped if he didn't know that he could commit suicide at any moment. I don't know if that is brave or stupid or what, but it was inevitable. Unless I'm totally missing Thompson's point, this is pretty much how I feel about life. I don't plan on comitting suicide. Not right now, anyway. But I'm trapped in a life that has nothing to offer me. I don't enjoy anything. I have no hope to ever have real dreams, and even less hope to ever make an effort to achieve them. I just do what is necessary to get by, and enough to keep myself from looking like a total failure. But I've never really been happy with anything I've done. I supplement my dissatisfaction with life with cheap thrills. Not to give myself pleasure, but to feed compulsion. I do things so I don't have to think about how much I hate myself. Killing myself obviously wouldn't make me ""happy."" But, Hell, neither does living.",

They're probably gonna be surprised, but not sad, no. I've written hundreds of suicide notes. I've found papers from somewhere around age 8 that just further convince me I don't want to deal with this anymore. I'll just type it for you: I don't like being sad I don't know why I am. A lot of my friends are happy. Why can't I be? I don't like it. (Can't tell what it says right here). I think the world would be better if I was gone. If mom and dad never had me, I think the world would be better. I don't like this. It's sad and I'm scared. I wish I wasn't born because I think my whole family would be better if I wasn't. I'm bad, and I don't know why I'm here. Usually I'd burn the drafts to make sure no one found them. I tried to kill myself three times, but none worked (obviously). My parents never found out. I'm not happy. As much as I feel like a really should want to get better, I don't. As much as I want to go to my parents and say all of this, I don't.

You could've ignored me at first, but no, you were selfish, you wanted to make yourself feel better so you said you'd ""always care"". I'm sick of tired of people doing this to me.

193,"New here and email from a ""friend"" Hi all, I am new here. I tried to take my life 3 years ago on this very day. I got involved with someone I shouldn't have and he decided, after I destroyed my life to be with him, that he didnt want to be with me. Needless to say it was one of the hardest things I have ever had to deal with. Well this person is back in my life thru mutual club events that we belong to. He is back with his wife and all seems so perfect. These people wanted nothing to do with me and now they are back involving themselves in clubs that I belong to to stay away from them. Anyways, the email. I got this today in response to an email asking for some moral support from this person. I haven't been able to stop crying since I got it. I feel that I am slipping back into that dark hole again, the one where you know you wont feel anymore pain. I am currently on the highest dosage of Effexer that they will prescribe and it works most of the time, but sometimes life gets a bit overwhelming. She did apologize and said that she hoped that I wasn't hurt by this part of her response. But how can you not be? This person has helped me overcome alot of issues over the past 3 years and it seems that when I need her the most she decides that she is tired of it. How does she think that I feel? I'm the lucky one that gets to live it everyday. Anyways here it is... ""I only hope that you can, some day, put it behind you...you really do need to move forward, and find some peace , and, I hope this doesn't offend you, but I find it harder and harder to listen to the same stuff all the time.....I cherish your friendship, and Sunday was so much fun....but so often it seems we just talk about them all the time, and I'm so sorry, but I just get so tired of it....""

I don't want to leave a mess, my current landlord has been very generous towards me, and I would hate to leave him with a body in his home or even my stuff. There doesn't seem to be anyway to avoid a mess, though I could pack my things and kill myself in the park. My current options are xxxxx and xxxxx. The last time I did something mischievous I was making xxxxx in my bathroom, a man showed up at my door. He was drunk, claimed Jesus was Lord, and he wanted to give me a blowjob, I turned him away.

198,"Lost desire to live My depression first started back when I was about 11 years old, it began shortly after my mother and I became homeless and ended up moving in with a relative. During the time that I lived with my relative I ended up getting molested by an older cousin, I started to have thoughts of self-hatred and despise for myself. After living with my mom for a for awhile, I finally decided to try living with my father due to how unhappy I was at the time. That ended up being a bigger mistake, my father was never home and I ended up spending a lot of my time alone in my room. After my first year of living with my father I ended up having my first migraine due to stress and anxiety. The doctor at the time told me there was nothing that could be done to help me with the migraines, that I would just have to deal with them as they came. When I hit high school that's when my depression hit me with full force, towards the end of my freshman year my dad finally decided to take me in to see a doctor. The doctor prescribed me anti-depressant. After I ran out of the first prescription I never asked for it to be refilled because it didn't help and all I was doing was sleeping because of it. When I graduated out of High School I ended up reaching out to my mother for the possibility to move back in with her, which she accepted without hesitation. I was still dealing with depression but not on a major scale at the time. Things went extremely south when I hit 21, I had a good group of friends and was living alone in my own apartment. Two of my friends who were dating ended up seperating, and the girl asked me if I could house her boyfriend at my place for a little while till he could find someplace to live since she didn't want him living with her at her place. I agreed, and laid down the ground rules to him; 1. Don't eat my food without asking. 2. Don't bring people over without asking 3. He's here for 3 months and after that he can find someplace else to live. He ignored both rules almost instantly, brought over at least 3 different girls while staying with me then got them drunk and slept with them on my bed, along with eating food that was mine. Towards the end of the third month I was informed that while he was staying with me he was trying to get back together with his ex (the friend who asked if he could stay with me). I was angery with him, and ended up asking him to leave. After he left, I informed his ex that he was sleeping with other girls while staying with me. She got furious with both myself and him, and stated she never wanted to talk to either of us again. I kinda just shrugged at the time and figured that as long as she didn't get back together with him that's all that mattered. About a month later I received a threatening message from the guy who was staying with me, stating he knew what I did and I better watch my back. I didn't pay any mind to it cause I really wasn't afraid of him. Shortly after the message my truck got vandalized, all my windows were bashed in and 'Rapist' was spray-painted along side of my truck. I was extremely confused until I found out when I informed my friend that her ex was sleeping around with other people while trying to get back with her, she decided to spread a rumor saying that I raped her. I lost all hope over everything, I felt like I couldn't trust people anymore, it really felt like she should have just killed me because the accusation that she had made of me nearly did. I ended up hiding in my apartment not talking to anyone for 4-5 months, and throughout that time my thoughts for suicide kept getting stronger and stronger until I finally attempted it. It ended up failing but not without reprecussion. I ended up getting taken away by an ambulance due to the non-stop vomitting and pain I was in, and had a MRI done to ensure I wasn't having an aneurysm due to the amount of pain I was feeling along the back of my head and neck. I never informed any of the medical staff that tended to me that it was a suicide attempt, I had them believe it was a panic/anxiety attack. When I became hospitalized my mother came and picked me up and had me move-in with her til I recovered, which I never really did. After a year or two of living with my mother again, I found a prescription to help me sleep when I had a back injury at my old job. I ended up attempting again. My mother the next morning literally had to shake me awake, my head was completely blurry and I couldn't keep myself from swaying. When I finally tried to stand up I found I had no strength or balance at all and stumbled across the room into the wall. It became apparent that I had done something the night before and my mom carried me to her room where she cared for me throughout the day as I continuously vomitted and blacked out. I haven't attempted suicide again since though it is constantly on my mind, like a voice in the back of my head repeating non-stop from when I am awake till I sleep. Some days it is worse than other, as of recent the thought has gotten a lot stronger and consistant. I tell myself every day I can't do it, at least not yet due to the fact that it would break my mother. Beyond my mother, there is no one else in my life that I honestly care how my death would affect them. I haven't spoken to my father in years, and I don't really have any other relatives that I am in contact with. I've hear people state things like 'Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem', 'Suicide is the cowards way out', etc. and honestly neither of those things change how I feel about it because I have dealt with it so long without relief. I saw another psychiatrist a year back or so, was given two different prescriptions for my depression which neither worked and I ended up stopping my psychiatric sessions because the psychiatrist only seemed interested in giving me meds.",

200,"College life makes me want to fucking kill myself... THe sad thing is I'm not taking any real hard classes at all. They're mostly physical fitness classes, and my online classes are a breeze. It's just the atmosphere and the fact that it's taking me ten years to get one degree. High school was easy for me in retrospect, but I never fit in the social atmosphere of any of the schools (I've been to three). I always eneded up hanging out with the stoners and skaters at every school I've been too...which was cool cause at that point I didn't really give two shits about anyone other than the people I was cool with and myself...but boy was I lonely most of the time. Now, here I am at 27 finishing up my bachelors. I'm just too old to be here and it's painfully obvious everytime I step through this joint. People look at me like I'm some kind of weirdo, whereas I'm the one looking at them like some kind of weirdo. I constantly have people staring at me whenever I'm walking through the campus and it just pisses me off. What the fuck are you staring at? Didn't your mother ever tell you not to stare? I just attribute it to the backwater and uncouth nature of this area. In fact I get obnoxious stares pretty much most of the time I go places. When I'm in a coffee shop blogging on tumblr, I've been getting stares from people cause they act like they've never seen a black dude blogging on his computer in a coffee shop before. I honestly don't get people staring at me in any other city I've been to except Pittsburgh and it's mind boggling. As well, I feel like I can't even relate to like 99.98% of people in this city anymore and the Pitt campus. I'm a rogue agent as far as it's concerned. I embrace my unique qualities, but it sucks being is such a stupid, cultureless and conformist city as this one. It drives me insane. I just want to graduate and get the hell out of this city before I end up harming myself something serious. I can't stand it anymore. The one thing I hate about it is being here always reminds me of how much I don't want to be here and how things worked out for my friends and never worked out for me. This is probably the reason I don't want to talk to any of my high school friends anymore. TI put myself in my own world where their constant bragging about buying about new houses, cars, new jobs, new significant others doesn't even matter to me anymore. Fuck them. They're dead to me. It frustrates me being in this stupid, pissant, redneck, uncultured, xenophobic city and college and I want to get the fuck out. It's sad. Yesterday, I was actually feeling good. But then again, it was sunny and I was on my medication. But today, I'm just fucking miserable. I didn't take my meds, it's grey and rainy, I just want to go to my apartment and play some music on my turntables but I don't even have a counterweight for one of them. Times like this, I think it would just be easier to kill myself and not have to care about anything else. Pittsburgh is really making me start to hate being alive in America. It's so repressive. I can't even be myself here without people taking it the wrong way, viewing me as some rabbelrouser, or just not even giving me a chance cause I'm not a carbon copy of every other person here.",

207,"Suicide needs to end. Please read this. Mental imbalance is about as acceptable as herpes. It’s never going to be accepted. But really, it’s a disease just like cancer. It just happens, and eats away all the good parts of your brain, like judgment, and happiness, and perception, and memory, and life. And you can die from depression just like any other disease. And it’s not as if people choose it. So why is it still a joke of medicine. ‘She died of cancer’ is a lot more socially acceptable to people than ‘She committed suicide.’ Why? Why is that? Someone please, just this once, answer me. Why is it unacceptable for a person to hurt so badly on the inside that it becomes unbearable? Why is that not as serious as something physically wrong? In my opinion, something mentally and emotionally wrong is much more painful and acceptable than cancer or any other physical ailment. Cancer can be treated, depression stays with you. Yes, you can take medicine to help it, but does that really help it? No. It just clouds your mind from the reality of what's actually going on. It causes you to appear more stable and accepting of life. Newsflash people, we live in a fucked up world. If you didn't feel the slightest bit of depression, anger, pain, guilt, disappointment, then you wouldn't be human. And if people continue to judge others by not wanting to be here any longer, then it's never going to stop. Look around you, take a look in the mirror, anything. Just open your fucking eyes. Things are not okay right now, to say the least. And they seem to be getting worse day by day. Suicide is real. Suicide is here. And.. Suicide is preventable.",

It started as an affair, a very long distance affair. Then he moved to my city. Eventually she left him and he came running to me. I was thrilled. I had always been under the delusion that having him as a friend was better than having nothing. We picked up right away as we had left off as lovers and friends. He was spending 5-6 evenings a week at my house with my 3 year old DS. He was also spending the night on weekends. He suffers from SAD, and his wife leaving him and basically telling him he was worthless sent him spiraling into a deep depression. But as I had always been in the past, I was right there for him believing that my dreams were finally coming true. This went on for many months. Then he kind of withdrew from me, blaming long hours at work. We still were talking and texting, but I hadn't actually seen him in months. He never told me that anything had changed. Well today on Facebook I had a notification about him. I clicked it as I would with any of my friends. I see a post from another girl saying that she had posted on her BF's page...there it was...bigger than all get out...the post that she had mentioned on his wall. Needless to say I am finding myself devestated right now. I was to cry, but my DS is right here. I want to SI, but again, my DS is right here. We were just texting a few days ago and he was talking about coming over to visit. WTF!!! I need help! I know that the most common response is that I was just a rebound person, to let it go. But I feel like he was/is leading me on and it is killing me. I have loved him with all of my heart for so long that unless he flat out tells me....I continue to delude myself into believing that there is hope. All along my therapist and case manager have been afraid that I was going to get hurt....now months later, here I am hurt. I really hope that someone reads this, because I am falling apart on the inside right now. I need to talk. I need support. I need help. I feel bad for coming back here and asking for help after being away for so long. So, please forgive my absense and don't hold it against me. ~WoundedHeart",
212,"My family would think it was great if I died So often I've read here ""I can't commit suicide because it would hurt my parents"" or my family so much. I really can't even imagine that. First of all, I am in the fifties and don't have a family of my own. So there is nobody who would even miss me or think it was there job to bury me. But the only family I do have, my family of origin, hate me and treat me like absolute garbage. Well, not my mom. She is elderly and lives with my sister. My sister went on vacation so my mom is alone. I called my mom and said I would go come down just for the day yesterday to visit her. My niece came over and found out and said I was not allowed under my sister's roof. My sister hates me. No reason given. She smiles in your face, sharpens a knife behind your back. My mom is lonely. I called both my nieces who were dropping in on my mom and neither one would return my phone calls. I called my mom again and said are they going to call the police if I visit you? Then my sister lied and said she never said it, but she did, and she just makes everything worse by lying about lying. A lot of stuff has happened between my sister and I that nobody knows about- she is abusive and manipulative. Anyway nobody knows my side of anythng and they are all afraid to offend her. So I am locked out of everything. And this weekend I could not even visit my mother. I honestly think if I killed myself they would be disgusted and not bother to even bury me. They hate me and don't even talk to me. I never did anything to deserve this. And right now I wish I were dead. I am so depressed I am in physical pain and exhausted. I hate my sister for being so cruel. I would like to never have to deal with her again. I would like my life to be over now. OO",
213,Confused I've been concerned with how I've been feeling for years but I've never discussed my feelings with anyone because I'm scared. Just writing this post is making me anxious and uncomfortable but I think it's a good first step to help deal with what's going on. This past week I've been feeling really suicidal. I'm actually surprised that I haven't done anything yet. My thoughts are beginning to scare me and I'm scared that I'm just going to give up trying. I've felt this way before but I've managed to work through it but this time feels different somehow. I don't really know how to seek help for what's going on and I feel like things are not going to improve any time soon. There's only so many times one can say things will improve and actually believe that it's going to happen. I've been tempted to go to the emergency room but I'm scared. Just thinking about it I can feel my anxiety levels rise and my heart pounding in my chest. I also have so many things coming up and so many things to do that I can't imagine what would happen if I would have to stay in the hospital for any length of time. I also don't know if I can actually muster the courage to tell someone that I'm not fine and I need help. I don't want to kill myself but I do and it's beginning to feel like more and more of a good idea every day. I'm feeling awful and so confused that I'm not sure what to do anymore. I'm a 21 year old female and I live in Canada. I don't really have anyone to talk to about this in real life so any advice would be extremely appreciated. Thank you!,
214,"Do you cry much? I think crying is of vital importance if you seriously do want to help yourself. It can be very difficult to let it all out and talking to professional people just seems too... official, emotionless and forced. But speaking as someone whose been standing on cliffs for the past 18 months and staying around simply because I didn't have the courage to jump, it's incredibly therapeutic and the best possible release to let it all out, either on your own or with someone who has genuinely been there.",
215,Emptiness. I have no friends. Can't talk to girls. I don't even think i want to talk to people. I don't see any point in living. I'm just thinking about suicide and how comfortable it sounds but i'm definitely not going to do it.,
216,"What is going on Things are good. I am drug and alcohol free and making plans for the future. I don't feel 'depressed' right now, which is a really good thing. I have a sense of purpose. BUT I consider suicide on a daily basis. Spontaneously. Rapidly. It is hard to not feel overwhelmed by these sudden urges. There are methods all around me every single day and it physically pains me to keep myself in check. I use to get similar feelings when I was younger but they were not self harm but outward harm where I would drift off into daydreams and see myself harming entire rooms full of people. It became so bad that a few times I actually thought I had gone through with it. There was literally no line between reality and fantasy. These episodes would usually be followed by shear panic and utmost distress. Sometimes I would pass out. What I feel now is almost exactly the same but I see myself committing suicide. It isn't as graphically detailed, or as distressing, nor have I passed out. I am fearful of what will happen if I open up to a counsellor, or mental health worker. Is this insanity? I feel even further isolated because I have never heard anyone expressing these kinds of thoughts/feelings. Does anyone else experience this? Can anyone offer advice? Thank you in advance.",
217,"Perhaps I don't want to kill myself after all. . . I was thinking during another low point in my mental (vocabulary's shit, not even gonna try anymore) process of depression, and I sort of came to a realization that I might not want to die. I might just want to convince everyone else in the world that I do in fact deserve to die. I was going through the infinitely long (and steadily growing) list of reasons why I should kill myself, and I had an epiphany: All the depressed people out there feel sorry for themselves constantly. I don't really feel sorry for myself. I think that I deserve all of this, as I know exactly what my faults are and just won't fix them. I am a walking zombie (that covers laziness). I am stupid beyond the point of reason. Physically I am weak and unattractive. All of this stuff that is just getting worse points towards the obvious direction of suicide, but the thing is, I can't/won't do it. Any rational person would rid the world of their presence if they were the way I am. There are literally no redeemable qualities. I think that, without consciously realizing it, my entire purpose as a human being is to convince others that I should be dead. I don't know what the point of it is, but that's just how it is.",
218,"What if... Hey friends.... First of all, sorry for all the spelling mistakes I might make... I'm from Denmark, but I'll try my best in english... Well, I think many of you maybe have thought about the queston ""what if I just was gone?"" and ""What would happen then?""... I do... year, I have thought about it a lot, for a while now... ""who will cry? and who will care? Who will honestly miss you"".... I have to say, that I'm not an unpopular girl, actually I have pretty many ""friends"".. or so the rest of the world think... the fact is, that I only think I have 1 real friend... He's name is Jakob... I think he might be the only one, who really gonna miss me, besides my family... Have you guys ever read or seen the story about Hazel Grace, ""The Fault in Our Stars""? There is a guy, in the book, who says something like: everybody will be forgotten at some time, and someday you'll be not on any mind anymore... you'll just end up like nothing.... And I think the author, John Green, is right.... at the end I maybe don't matter to anyone... Not even my family... they'll get over it at a time... I am crying myself into sleep, but still smiling to the world, maybe even more than all they other people, just to be sure, that they wont see through me.... I really don't think anyone will miss me that much... the few ones, who will miss me, like my family and Jakob, have a lot of other ""friends"".... year, I think they will cry, but they'll also get over it... Sorry for this depressing post, but I just have to come out with it somewhere.... it's late now... over midnight, but I'm not tired... but I have to make myself fall in sleep now, so I can wake up tomorrow, and make sure everything seems normal....",
219,"feeling extremely low I am feeling so extremely low right now and am hating every single aspect about myself and feeling worthless. apparently I've been doing a good job and people have been thinking I'm doing much better. but that's cos I get tired of people continually asking how I am and me always having to say that I'm not doing too good so I say I'm ok now instead. No one sees how bad it really is. I plan things out in my mind ways to go. I feel like I'm trapped in limbo where I don't want to live but am not sure if I want to die either but most of my thoughts centre around death and not having to be here any more. I feel like there's nothing left for me to give and this world is too harsh and cruel. I'm just not coping with life right now and I'm not sure where to turn. I don't want to call a mental health line and find ways to ""be safe"" or get asked what do I usually do to make myself feel safe? The answer is nothing makes me feel safe. I'm trapped in my head with no way out. And the worst part is I don't want people to see me like this or have to deal with me. So my front that's cracking slightly is fixed in place. I suppose anyone reading this would think what a loser she's so self absorbed. Maybe I am but it still doesn't stop these feelings. Like knives that cut through my soul. Feeling like I live a dead existence and I die a little each day inside. I'm really sorry for anyone reading this.",
220,"My Story: My Mother Thanks for taking the time to read today, I am currently in High School, an aspiring musician, for the past several years I have been bullied and battled depression and I have been seen visibly sad, sometimes I would be crying in my room or under the kitchen table, especially now, and most of the times I cannot give a reason why because I knew she wouldn't understand. I knew because I brought this problem up before and when I talk about my problems, she makes it worse by telling me that I am making up my own problems. Because of this, I cannot tell my mom about my problems and try my best not to cry about my problems in front of my mother. In High School, I can barely keep up in class, especially in the beginning when grades have a hard time getting off the ground and every night I stay up late doing my homework and the next morning waking up with massive sleep deprivation and my mother doesn't stop badgering me about it. My mother holds me up to high expectations that I cannot meet. In times when I cannot meet up to other's expectations I meet scathing criticism and I just can't take it sometimes and it makes me want to cry but I know that I cannot. I know that I perform terribly in academics, or at least I am led to believe that because my mother doesn't believe I am doing good enough and at this rate, she'll never give me her approval. She pressures me into pursuing a musical career because she invested many years of her life to pushing me. But I am not a good musician, and when I fail, she always plays on my guilt despite my best efforts. I have no social life, no friends, and I always get sad when other people are enjoying themselves with their friends, nobody cares about me, everybody hates me, nobody understands my problems. Ever since last summer, I wanted to kill myself because things were only about to get harder especially when I have to deal with all of my problems at once and I wanted to avoid the transition into the next school year. I want my mom to comfort me for once instead of making my problems even worse. I don't want to bear the pain of my daily criticism and spending this time feeling sorry and sad for my shortcomings. I remain somewhat skeptical about killing myself because I know that I can have a better life if I can somehow pull through but it is just a question of ""how much can I take before I break down?"" My mother is overly strong, and unlike her, I am not that strong, I cannot see myself pulling myself through this. My mother also has too much hope in people, she sees strength in people even when it isn't there. I have no strength, I don't want to live in this hard world. All of this wouldn't be as hard if my mother didn't have to make it worse every time. If I do kill myself, I can take peace in the fact that she will reflect on her choices while underneath a mountain of debt. She'll know how it feels be live under unbearable expectations and inexplicable sadness. Again thank you for taking the time to read this post. I know, it may be hard for you to relate, but find it in your heart to not be too condemning of my story. This is the only place where I can speak about my problems without other people trying to get me ""help"" but instead botches up my future. Despite my situations with my mother, she may be the only person who can help me become who I want to be.",
221,"I do not want to be here anymore I hope you all can bear with me as I'm not very articulate and have trouble describing my situation much of the time. Basically, I've somewhat recently decided that I plan to kill myself. I suppose I have to mention that this is not a note. I decided a while ago yet am still around now, just sorting some last things out, so clearly I'm in no rush. Everything has just become too painful. My life has deteriorated to nothing. I sit in bed all day. I don't do anything anymore, nor do I have the will to. My eating schedule is thrown off, my memory is in shambles, I dropped out of school, and I don't communicate with anyone, even the people living in the same house as me. All my life I have been depressed, but it's finally culminated and I am finally finished. I've considered many things: reasons for staying, strategies for overcoming depression, the consequences of what I would do. But none of it has made any difference for me. And then I stumbled on this site. So I thought I would come here and share and see if any of you have anything to say about this. I don't expect anyone to change my mind and that should not be your goal if you respond, it will likely just make me mad. Just say what you think. I don't care if its happy, sad, supportive, questioning, disagreement, anything. I am here while I wait just trying to gather all the viewpoints possible. I also suppose talking this out may help me, though again I find it very unlikely.",
222,"Cant get them out Hello im new here. And...I just need to talk about things with someone, hopefully i'll gain some insight here. Here's my story, im 22. I've always suffered from alot of panic attacks, and then later on in my puberty depression followed. I've also had psychosis problems, which made really angry and then i break down and cry. I have suicide thoughts everyday, 2 years back i tried to kill myself (That failed obviously.) I had to go to the hospital. But the suicide attempt only made it worse, today im afraid that i might impulsively kill myself. I want to have a good life, with love and maybe some moeny. But i also want to do my dream which is music. My girlfriend wants to leave me, she says i drag her down. That im a depressive guy, before she met me she was feeling fine. ( I dot know, i tried my best to be a good boyfriend.) She has lost her feelings for me, and there is no sex left in the relationship. Just ackwardness, and i dont even feel for her sometimes. I dont know what to do regarding that either. But that just makes me want to kill myself even more. She said she's afraid to leave me so i dont kill myself. I promised her i wouldnt. But these suicide thoughts just keep on creeping in. I cant sleep at night because im paranoid, of spirits and aliens and whatnot. I got no education, i got no money. Can barely afford to eat. I've tried pills, they fucked me up. I've tried psychologists and programs etc....still doesnt change anything. Im beginning to feel like a wasted life, that this shit will never get better. I will always be alien to myself and others. And sometimes it just seems easier to kill myself. What the fu*k can I do to improve my life? How can I find love? Where will I get money? Where will I find happiness? Is it even worth it? Everyone else seem like they're depressed to, just trying to ignore it. Like som sort of escapism. The idea of suicide just keeps coming, and i feel on the edge. BEcause theres a part of me that wants to live, but it isnt strong enough. I also get these memories, flashing in my head like 1-3 seconds. All the painful memories.... I need some fucking help! :(",
223,"I'm done... I'm only 17 years old, and I've been wanting to kill myself since I was 16. Now that is sad. What kind of teen/kid even should be thinking about harming themselves. I believe God put us here on this world for a reason. And we are wanting to take our lifes, it's just not fare. But I honestly can't take it no more. Every time I'm alone which is when I'm at home. I get really depressed and start thinking of the past, and it just hurts. I wish I could talk to someone. I told my mother that I wanted depressing pills but she told me I didn't need them, because my brother was wanting to kill himself at my age too but he didn't. She is the worst mother ever she doesn't even try and find out what is wrong with me or anything. I mean if my kids had the guts to tell me that there life wasn't good and they didn't feel like living anymore I would hear them out. I wouldn't just let leave them harming themselves because that would just hurts me. I'll just say everything here since I won't and never will have anyone else to talk to like this. I don't think I deserve to leave because my life has been fucked up ever since day one. My mom was never really a mother and well my father was even worse. I get attracted or become friends with the wrong people -- nevermind I don't even think I can do this because I'm scared of one of my friends finding out about this article. I don't know maybe when I turn 18, I can save up enough money and talk to someone about my problems. I just hope I don't do anything stupid from here and now on.",
224,"suicide is too complicated i can't really kill myself, it's been way too long time being told how mean it is and how sad my family and friends will be so i just can't, when i'm too bad i just get stuck sitting in a corner instead or something like that, but seriously, i want to stop this.. living. and the longer time i go on and live, the more convinced i get that my life is going to suck forever and that still i can't kill myself. i want to get away, dunno where but since i can't die then just anything else i guess, just want to disapear and don't have any responsabilities just be left alone to waste my life until everyone has forgotten me so i can die without anyone bothering. don't feel like speaking, yet i want to be around people, listen to them and watch them but not tell them anything or laugh at what they say, just be outside becuz it's not worth it, even the people i am close to feels like they're very far away and i just always act, know what they want and try to be that, it's just very confusing, to know what i am like becuz i don't think i really am anything, when i'm alone and don't have to act or anything, i just lie in my bed and stare at the walls and try not to think about everything i have to go to become a more successful person, try to forget that there's always something i could do to become better, prettier, smarter, and that i don't have any time for just selfharming and feeling sorry for myself and freaking out.. i am never ever happy about anything, i try to think how happy i am to have a nice mom and a nice friend and food and everything but instead i always end up thinking that i could have known more about history and i could have had prettier clothes and i could have had a more wellpaid job and i could be better in school and i could be able to play more instruments ect .. but when it comes to what i really want, i just want someone who loves me and who isn't mad at for everything, but no one can stand being in a relationship with me so i try and be perfect in all other ways, but i don't have time and soon it'll be too late and i should just die now so i don't get time to realise i have failed. i just want to get my own appartment, without any windows or other irritating shit things and then just crash on the floor and ignore all people becuz there's no one who can help me or understand, everyone goes away, i want to give up on this whole being-a-social-person thing, feels like i am all alone even if i am not and who the hell will care anyways.... wish suicide would have been just so easy to just die and not have all these problems about everyone and everything.

227,"Becoming suicidal completely changed my perception I've been depressed in the past, but I always held out hope for the future. Lately though I can't say that hope is still there. More and more I feel backed into a corner without any options. Medication is helping, but the hopelessness is still there about the future. The worst thing is all the realizations I've come to have and my perception of the world flipped upside down. I find myself wondering about death more and more. I also question any afterlife now which I had always believed there was something in the past. But the more I live with this altered perception the more tormented I feel. I see everything in a dark way now. I see no good left in the world. I see pain. Happiness and joy seem like nothing more than meaningless passing emotions. The purpose of life has been questioned. I see now why some people commit suicide and it's a frightening reality. I know how I was before this and I feel like I'll never be able to find that side of me again. Maybe it's just me getting older, but there's the depression too. The scary thought that nobody is going to come save us from ourselves. And this is it, once your dead it's just like you were before you were born. That's scary as well. I hope I can feel joy again one day.",

This haunts me on a daily basis. Thanks to the bitterness of my creation my parents maintained a negative and aggressively angry environment for our family. I've finally come out of my denial and now that I realize all of this an uncontrollable monster has erupted out of me.

I'm 25 years old and still live with my parents and living off them financially. I was expelled from college for failing grades. I spent 3 years at college and didn't make it beyond freshman status. I only graduated high school because a couple of teachers felt sorry for me. My grades were the lowest of all my graduating class. All of my cousins and siblings have graduated from top universities. My brother is currently attending grad school at Duke, my sister is getting her masters, my cousin is a Yale graduate, my neice graduated from Vanderbilt, etc. All of my cousins, siblings, and friends are professionals. I am nothing but trash. I have failed. My father is 71 and will not be able to retire because I wasted his savings on college that I failed at. I'm financially dependant so he will never be able to retire. Girls are repulsed by me and alwasy have been. My problems go beyond the standard scope.

There needs to be societal customs that encourage suicide for people like me. Everything will be better when I'm no longer sickening the world with my existence. Don't think I'm being too hard on myself. Trust me, what I've said here makes my failures look like successes. This is only the tip of the iceburg. I cannot be forgiven or allowed to live any longer. I want to commit suicide. Maybe my suicide will be the only thing I did right. I know when I'm gone everything will be better. We sell ourselves this lie that ""every life is precious"". Nope, not true. My life isn't. My life should be eradicated at all costs. Its just fortunate that I recognize this fact.",

EVER! everyone on here wants to get better. i DONT want to get better and i WANT to stay suicidal, and i WANT to die. and i deserve punishment for that. because when i kill myself, God will hate me and he should. if there is no God well, i guess we see nothing and that just makes life even more meaningless. im hurting, but not even close to bad enough to kill myself over. especially when i have had things good and have a future because im only 20. but thats too old. 20 is too long for me. everyone here should be disgusted with me. i dont even know why im posting this shit. my therapist made me promise i wouldnt do anything to myself before my next appointment which is next tuesday. but if she makes me promise it again, i wont do it. because my time is near and death is calling my name. i dont care how my family and friends will hurt because im just that much more of an evil satanic piece of fucking shit. fuck me.",

258,"No way out Hi, I'm new to this forum, and I hope to get the help that I need. I'm a 20-year-old female college student. Could anyone kindly give me your opinion, or any advice on how to cope? Or a link to a helpful website? My current biggest problem is either a panic or flashback. It lasts for hours, hits any time of a day. When I'm in panic, I can't even do those ""grounding methods"" and I swear the fear is worse than death. It could drive me to automatically kill myself. My T told me the ""flashback"" was just a withdrawal symptom from stop taking Asendin I was supposed to keep taking. I hated the Asendin because it didn't ""lift my moods"" like my Dr. told me. Instead, it just made me drowsy and engage in worse bulimic behaviors. But it's been a while since I stopped taking Asendin, and I still have anxiety and panic, so it's more than just a withdrawal symptom, right? So like many self-help sites say, I tried sending e-mails to friends and calling suicidal hotlines, but my friends of course don't reply, and overall, nothing has worked. (Except for overdosing on OTC meds. My liver must be failing.) I have no friends. Anyone I've met, once they got to know what kind of person I was, left me. They refuse any contact with me. Borderline personality I believe is what I have. (Just a self-diagnosis.) Moreover, most of traits written in the Personality disorder ""cluster B"" applies to me as well. I've been bulimic since age 15. I'm currently anorexic, which stabilizes my mind because it's one of my short list of coping methods, along with self-injury and suicidal attempts. I plan to quit college because my poor concentration has gotten worse and can't read anything anymore. It's also hard for me to understand auditory information. I'm too anxious in public places, so when I'm sitting in class I often become panicked, so many times I ""run away"" and go home and engage in bulimic behaviors (binge and purge). This was the pattern. I'm now too tired to go through this routine. I curse myself for lacking self-control. I'm a lazy pig. But education doesn't seem to matter anymore. I have numerous health problems partially because of the dysfunctional family I was raised in. For example, my spine became acutely curved at 13, and at 18 I was finally able to have a surgery to correct it. But it was too late I think. I'm going to die soon from liver illness or something. I was abused in every way and it just showed itself in my spine. I swear the panic and fear is worse than death. Does anyone know how to die without pain? I don't want anything from life any more. No one loves me, I swear. Or, does anyone know how to stop being so anxious without meds? Like holistic dietary supplements? Note that my panic is intense. I hate therapies. They don't really know. I can't afford inpatient programs. Life is awful.",

260,"Fell out of bed The topic of this post is not meant as a joke. It is just my way of saying things are hard right now. I'm not sure why I came onto this site. Originally it was a way to say goodbye. Not to reach out for help or expect a miracle. And *not to throw myself a pity party at all but I need to explain why so other people can understand and to ease my guilt. Funny thing is I now have to write 20 post because I may have found an alternative but can't send a private message until I post 20 times. Unbelievable!* Anyway, here is my story. I'm 41, not very young, not too old but I felt like I had no other options. I worked as a manager for years. Then I lost my job. So for years I have had 5 part times jobs. That's right FIVE! Sometimes I worked up to 300 hours a month. No exaggeration. I live in Orange County California and those of you in the area know it is not cheap to live here. Every penny counted. Christmas was my busiest time of the year and by January things started to slow down a bit. Enough so I could catch my breath. One night in January I decided I would finally go out after work. I figured I would have a drink and take a break for an hour or two. I had 2 1/2 drinks. But when you don't weigh a lot and your aren't use to drinking it effects you. I decided I was going to sleep in my car until I was sober enough to drive.* 25 minutes later police knock on the window and go through the whole sobriety deal with me. I explained I wasn't driving but the key was in the ignition and the heat was on in the car and he claimed he had a right. I blew a .09. Legal limit in Cali is .08. I begged him not to arrest me or I would lose my jobs. ( I drove from various locations within Orange County and LA county for each of the jobs I had). I was not able to have one of these jobs without a valid license and certainly not with a DUI conviction. Besides I could never afford to get my car out of impound let alone an attorney for the charges. *I lost my jobs. Unemployment denied me benefits because i signed paperwork stating a valid license is necessary for employment. No money means no home, no car *and no future. I can't get my license until I pay for a DUI school but that cost 579.00. Not to mention the 2000.00 in fines I have to pay and they tack on additional cost for an alcohol liaison fee, DNA collection fee, MADD lecture etc.. *I made 179.00 last month. I do not qualify for welfare assistance in California because I have no children and I made 179 last month. I receive 90.00 in food stamps a month. I have no where to live. I now look like all those people you pass on the street. *I was living in my car but it died, was booted and towed away. I have an iPod touch that I am writing this on. The screen is cracked but I can still kinda see what the screen says. I've tried to sell it but no one wants it and it has been my only lifeline to the normal world. Every now and again I can charge it at the library and the sit outside staples or anywhere they have free wifi and apply for jobs or try to contact people. My family are all dead. I have friends, never really did and those I do know aren't in a much better position.* I've tried to not give up. I really have but I can't being homeless and alone anymore. No one cares. No one wants to even look you in the eye. I don't ask for help anymore. The people I once knew have said no so often I feel sympathy for them now. Its hard to turn away someone when your own survival is at stake every month. I know how they feel. They don't want to be put in the position and I am tired of crying about it afterward.* I just want this to stop. I don't know any other way then death. Things are so bad now I don't know if I can come back from this. Being homeless and alone is terrible. I've been beaten, spit at, laugh at and told to get a job so many times and it crushes me everytime. You don't know until you are there. Next time you pass someone, even if you can't help them, at least smile and say hello. We are human and we are just trying to survive. We understand you can't help financially, believe me we do understand. But a friendly word and smile helps.* This was going to be my goodbye, I have no one to call and say goodbye to personally. But then I came on here and I read a post that offered help finding work. I *have to write 20 posts to message the person. I can try to sneak in somewhere and shower, clean up a bit. I held onto an old suit so I can wear it to an interview. This gives me some hope back. Knowing that someone might be able to help. This is my first post",

264,"it takes guts it takes guts to stand up and speak one's truth. abuse and hurt can silence a person. feelings are powerful and they can even sometime silence even me. i have had to fight with myself to get the courage to speak. i understand that not everyone is as strong or as resilient as i am. i have much compassion for people. i just wish i had more help when it comes to fighting against those who abuse power and priviledge, because the shit keep going, it get perpetuated when no one speaks up. speech is so difficult. i know because i didn't talk for a couple years. my self esteem was so low that i didn't think i was even visible. i thought nobody could see me, literally. sometimes i wonder where i get the gumption, where i get the strength, where i get the hootspa, to stand up in front of an unsupportive mob and state my piece. i have stood up in front of not-so-understanding audiences and spoke because i had to, because something inside me drove me to, because i felt i had to do my part. i have a strong sense of responsibility to humanity, i guess. i can take this pressure usually. but with the added pressure of my serious and complicated and unknown physical ailments, i can no longer do what i've normally done. i find i need real support from others now. it is lonely though, because few are as strong as i am, and i find that i am out there all alone, limping along, struggling single handedly. i could give up, and you all would understand if i did. but there is something that drives me to keep going. i actually hate this part of me, i hate this thing that drives me to get up in spite of the fact that i am exhausted and in despair. it hurts to have to get up when my legs and spirit are broken. i appreciate all the supportive responses you guys have given me, for i know how hard it is to rouse oneself up out of one's own misery to go support another. on another note, i am a couple doctor's appointments scheduled, in the hopes that they can get a handle on my physical issues. i am terrified and afraid to hope, and my behavior and thinking are reflecting this. fear has been the bane of my existence. fear of hope, fear of people, fear of the unknown, fear of failure, fear of success, fear of further poverty, fear of more social rejection....these are my fears. i am doing my best, however, to work through them. it is very very difficult, and i am not doing too well. it was hard to write this post. my mind is doing it's psychosis thing,as i am terrified about so many large life issues. but i rally, and find real words, because i feel i owe it to myself, that i owe it to my incredible spirit, to speak. when i speak, it is for me, it is me honoring me, because for so long i was dishonored by so many. i speak for me because i am finally here for me. thank you.",

The divorce has not been cancelled yet. Prolly in November. And right now, at the very instant, I am craving alcohol worse than I have in months. Add to that I am a pathetic failure. Now my job is in jeopardy too. WTF? I have no confidence, I have no redeemable social skills. All I do is play drums at church, that's it. That's the extent of my social involvement. I even start smoking cig's again, behind my wife's back. And this job thing, well if I can't turn around my f up's quick I may be fired by year's end. And back on the homefront, well the wife still refers to things as their stuff and mine, and not OURS. Somedays I think it would have been better had I gone thru with what I had intended to go thru with last fall. Hell...it's a been a year and I still want to die. that should tell you all you need to know about this looser.",
266,"Unacceptable That is how I feel. I am not accepted by the only family I have. I have been estranged from most family for a long time. After reaching out to my mother who I hadn't seen in over ten years, I finally visited her last weekend. Her attitude towards me was very angry and critical, which is the same as it has always been. She is angry at me because I did not marry and have children, and because I moved away. She does not think anyone in the family should call or visit me. Even though I only live a few hours away nobody has visited me in 10 years, even when I had no car and no job. I think I have a rather extreme case of middle child syndrome... the lack of support shown from my family towards me has always been amazing... other people have commented on it. My older sibling is perfect and the younger one was always babied. I was ignored or criticized. At this stage of life I don't know if there is any hope for changing things. I am 55 and have no family of my own. My family of origin seems to view me as someone who should show up once a year to bring them presents and then fold up and disappear into a closet. There is nothing I can say or do to make things better. My family hates me for not having a family. How amazing is that? If I killed myself they would be so fucking angry at me. But it would be proof to them of what a loser I am. All single people are ""oddballs"" according to my mother. Childless women aren't normal. No, I don't really agree with her or believe this. But there is nowhere in the world where I feel so profoundly unloved, unaccepted, and worthless as when I am with my mother. She just hates me for not validating her life. If I killed myself she would be embarrassed. She would only miss criticizing me.",

268,"I need help. :( My name is Sophia and i'm eighteen years old, I have recently been contemplating suicide, more often than usual. I feel killing myself may be the only way to escape the prison of my own mind. I have no one to confide in, not a single friend on this earth willing to listen to me spill my soul.:( when I was about 14 I was molested by a close friend of my brother. I have never told anyone this and this memory seems to cloud over me like an endless fog I felt disgusted with myself and knew it was all my fault. I believe this has impacted my whole life terribly I don't think I can ever feel love because my innocence has been ruined. I have also recently become addicted to sleeping pills it seems they help ease my pain. I'm constantly having anxiety attacks and my soul aches. I am honestly ready to leave this life. I've tried talking to god, but have started to give up hope and faith because it seems my conversations leave him speechless. I often wonder why god wasted a life on me.

No time for people to try and figure out who I really am... I'm just to difficult and unstable for this goddamned world to handle. There's no room for me to let out... I'm just like the little pigs that they kill when they are too small, why bother putting time and effort into a being that isn't going to make it anyways? That's what I am... except they can't kill humans, so they just lock them up in cages and label them insane. I just want to be away... away from all these people so I can at least die in peace... I can't even use my own forearm to realease my pain anymore, I can't afford to raise anymore suspicion. The LAST thing I want is to cause more problems for my family by having them pay for me while I'm away in a mental institution... and make them pay for counseling. And make the counselor waste his/her time on a lost cause like me. I could just die, and then they wouldn't have to worry about me at all. This whole world would just be a happier if I was gone... I don't even care if I have to go to hell anymore... or spend my life in a dark hole of pain and hunger and misery... at least at least I wouldn't be here, and at least there... I will be feeling something besides numbness and grief... and I wouldn't have to let people down anymore... I wouldn't have to live with the label of a hypocrite.

I just wish that there was someplace I could go... someplace that would just take all this suffering away from my family and away from me. Is dying the only remedy I have left? I'm so confused... and so sad... I just want it all to be over with... One day I'll be happy and excited, I'll be artistic and writing my stories and hanging out with my sisters... but even then I'm not happy, I still feel stretched.

270,"A little update So today I was on the train with my mother, there were some old people getting on the train, I wanted to stand up and gave up my seat but I was worried that my mom will tell me off so I didn't. On our way out of the trainer this woman made some bad comment about me and my mother for not giving up our seats, I think her point is valid, but if she only knew why I didn't give up my seat. On our way back on the trainer, there was a lot of people on the train, I was standing next to the exit, the train stop, people were getting out, so since I was standing next to the exit I decide to leave the train for a moment to let people out, then my mother started to tell me off - telling me I should not have left , I could have done this, blah blah blah blah blah. Little things like this make me hate my life and my parents even more than I already do, I'm really sick of dealing with it. I'm not even allow to stupid decision as to which spot to stand on, how pathetic is my life.",

I just fucking can't wait too much longer... life just blows ass (I know, it's becoming a redundant, recursive statement.) Work days are stressful, annoying and exasperating, and days off are fucking boring, lethargic and pointless. Nobody wants anything to do with me (well, except bottom-feeder pathological liar leeches who want to drag me down to THEIR level) in any way. I've fucked everything in my life up... whether it's my fault or somebody else's... fuck difference does it make when it's fucked beyond repair anyways? I'm a 23-year-old college dropout loser with a shit job stuck at my mom's house (probably for the rest of my fucking life) and a small penis who is even more pathetic than your average Otaku... I'm just in the process of waiting to become a corpse so they can set me on fire and scatter my ashes away. I'm tired of this shit... I'm tired of having to guzzle down heavily-caffeinated beverages during the day just to function and jerk off several times a day/night just to calm my hormones. I'm sick of it all! There hasn't been a god fucking damn thing going for me since the start; I was useless since birth and my fucking family and friends had to fucking lie the shit out of me about my own self worth... they had to tell me I was a ""somebody"" and I was going to ""do great things"" with myself. FUCKING STOP FUCKING LYING TO ME!!! Stop setting the bar so high and putting the fucking weight of the world on my shoulders! I'm a worthless fucking waste of carbon and water and they all know it... I've known it deep in my heart ever since I was a toddler. They all know I'm a good-for-nothing failure... I couldn't even force myself through slave school (aka college) so that I could live a soul-destroying 9-5 cog in the machine sterile ass boring existence of quiet desperation, boring ugly sterile women, apathetic and unmotivated pale ass lazy kids, shitty ass minivan, daily Wal-Mart shopping, middle-class shitty fake ass house. I'm especially pissed because I couldn't make it as a singer because everybody fucking hates my singing (including myself) and they're all too big of pussies to even TELL me I suck TO MY MOTHERFUCKING FACE! BUNCHA CUNTS!!! Because of my small penis and pathetic virginity, I couldn't even FUCK for money as a pornstar! No... I'll be lucky if I end up as a fucking panhandler living in a fucking tent city! Everyone around me (family, friends, even kind peers) keeps on with their rhetoric of ""college college college"" like it's the fucking answer to everything in life. I mean, the people that say that know that OBVIOUSLY High School and even Junior High was busting my fucking ass enough to the point I dropped out of those. Some of the nicer, more optimistic/artistic ones have told me I need to ""pick myself back up and try again"" for what!? Just to get knocked the fuck out again? That's the mentality of people; they couldn't live without someone like me... someone whose like a fucked-up loser ass burnt out closet suicidal combination of Tweek and Butters from South Park. They need people like me so that they can feel better about themselves... so that there's always someone to tear apart like a cat's scratching post. Sadly, people like me never have a good fate; either I'll turn into a psychopath or a street bum or both. No, the buck stops here... Also, please don't talk me out of suicide... I will kill myself sooner or later. THIS WILL FUCKING HAPPEN! I REFUSE to deal with this bullshit for the rest of my life eventually ending up like fucking Randy Marsh at best.

Well, I just don't want to be a part of it. I know that suicide seems selfish, but I can't live for the sake of others either. This isn't a cry for help.

I don't want to them to look back and feel like they should have picked up on something so they could have gotten me help. I'm writing this to see if anyone else have had this feeling?

I'm tired of living everyday as if I want to end it all. To top it off, I'm tired of living with the same stomach pain, day after day, for 8 years now. I used to think depression was bad, but by god, stomach pain, and now headaches too! I've been wanting to die for years, and this may be how I go out. Maybe I have cancer. I'm just tired. I don't know how or why this all started. And I've fought for years to cure myself of it. I've tried everything. I'm so done. God, I hate life. I hate everyone in it. Everyone is either miserable, or out for themself. I can't help anyone because I'm miserable myself. What a miserable world we live in. And those that want to help you want to charge you hundreds of thousands of dollars, like some doctors who want to run tests on me. Do I look like I live in a first world country with universal healthcare, where taxes pay for everything? I live in America, where my taxes go to rich white Republicans, to fight wars. I'm just so tired. I had a nice job once. I had a house, at 20 years old. I would say I had a wife, but nope. Not only am I severely depressed, I'm gay too. Yipee! And a pisces. An emotional, sensitive, gay Pisces, who can't handle the world. Fuck my life. I don't understand it. I don't understand why I'm here, what my purpose is, what my potential is, to do anything. I don't know what makes me happy because nothing does make me happy right now, except the comforting thought of killing myself while I'm having my daily shower thoughts. I'm just done. Every time I try to convince myself to go buy something to kill myself with, again, I have the stupid fucking fear that if I die I'll somehow be punished, even in death, because my luck in life has told me God does not give one fuck about me, so if I die, I'm to continue being punished. I don't understand my thinking. I don't understand my beliefs. These thoughts just come and go. I have dreams of having a good life, but I don't do anything to act on them. I finally got the courage, at 27, to finally go to the fucking gym, and get a membership. Finally. I had purchased a membership a few years ago, and used it maybe twice, in a whole year! What a waste of money. This time I went 4 days in a row, and I commited myself to a workout plan, and then MAYBE I'd be happy, because endorphins. Nope. I get an hour of sweating, lifting, and stretching done. I go home. I want to die. I don't fucking understand it. Not to mention, I finally moved into a low-income apartment all by myselfs. And guess what? I have rats and mice that live in this apartment. I'm here -- in this fucking shit hole -- in this apartment, and this is my life. And I live here, with rats, and mice, and things that carry diseases. And my stomach hurts. And my brain hurts. And I want to go walk outside, but no, it's fucking freezing because of the winter coming. And I'd like to go for a drive, to get things off my mind, but no, my car's head gasket is busted, and that's a $1000 fix, and I just paid $3000 for it used, about a year worth of saving, and now I can't afford to fix my fucking car. 2 months old. And this is my luck. And this is my day. Every fucking day. I don't understand it. I don't know where I went wrong. I don't know what else to do. No therapist has helped me, in 6 years. No drugs have helped. Vitamins. Supplement. Diets. Juices. And now, exercise. Yup. I hate my life. And I don't ever see it getting fucking better. But no matter how many times I tell myself it won't get better, I still won't go out and kill myself. I'm trapped in a world where I live in constant pain, and the reminder that I can't end it, because I'm a fucking coward. Who wrote this shit, anyway? This world? Fuck.",

We won the Jack and Jill tourny. You would think that I would be happy that we won, but I really not. We shot well and earned almost all of our games but it still didn't make me feel better. Today is just another mindless painful day in my life. I am still not sure what to do with my depression. Thanks to all who posted to my ECT questions. It hasn't been offered as a treatment yet, but I am loosing all hope in anything and everything else. I don't feel like talking to my therapist is helping at all. When I go to see her the only feelings that I have are numb. That doesn't really help things along. I can't ask for someone new either. So, I guess that I am just stuck. I took a test this morning to see if I am pregnant. It came back negitive. I am glad for that. I have been doing things that are hurtful to myself along those lines. A couple of weeks ago when all of the really bad stuff happened to me, The hospital gave me Plan B. It is the morning after pill. Since I didn't know what if anything had happened to me over the course of those 2 1/2 days. They told me that I would start in 2 weeks. It has been over 2 weeks and nothing. I don't know what to think. I am happy that this one came back negitive. I guess that I could be screwed up from the overdoses that I took and being messed up on my birth control too. It just weighs heavily on my mind. I want to hurt, I want to die, but all that I can do is sit here and wait. It really sucks.. I hate being this way. I hate felling so down.

It would be such a beautiful release! No more stress, no more fear, no more self-loathing. The only thing tying me to this horrid existence is my daughter. I feel so much guilt just for allowing myself the luxury of the thought of taking my own life. Still, that guilt is not enough.

Everyone just asks me what they can do to help and they get mad at me when I say I don't know how they can help. Even if there is something that someone else can do I can never talk to anyone about it because I'm so uncomfortable because no one cares. No one wants to deal with me. They just want me to work everything out on my own, but I don't know how to do that. Everyone in my life just keeps getting upset with me. This never used to happen and I don't know what changed and why I'm suddenly such a piece of trash who can't talk to anyone anymore. I feel like my words mean nothing to these people. And when someone is counting on me to say something to make them feel better I can't do it. I don't know what to say. I'm useless. At this point I don't even feel like there's a reason for me to be around anymore. I can't handle myself and I can't get help and I really don't know what to do. I have anxiety attacks nearly every day and it's killing me. I can barely eat because of how anxious and depressed I constantly am. I really can't keep going like this but I can't get help either so I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm falling apart. I really need help right now. I needed help a long time ago but I didn't know how to get it, and here I am, where it could very well be already too late because I don't even know if I could handle help at this point even if I got it. I don't know what to do. And I'm running out of options. I really need to talk to someone to work out my life but I don't even know where to turn. I tried a counselor and that failed spectacularly. At this point I'm almost too anxious to leave my room so I don't know if I could see a therapist. I really don't know anymore. If someone has any shred of advice or anything please leave it below.

287,"Why I Desire Death So let me begin with the basics, I am not in danger of self slaughter currently, but I do have my sights set on death by age 30 (4ish years from now). I'm a male, single, employed (for now). I thought talking about my justification for suicide would be useful for me, in that, I can be exposed to new perspectives, write out my reasons and see them on paper, as well as be challenged, and challenge others. You see I want my death to be an informed decision, not a grave mistake. So with that said I don't know if this is the right forum to be talking about it, if it is not, than please direct be to a more appropriate one. So lets start off with my abilities: I have a terrible time focusing and staying on task, recalling information on the spot, expanding my thoughts, retaining incoming information, poor with reading and writing, slow at processing information, and difinately view the world in an odd manner, and probably a limited one due to cognitive disabilities. I have so many problems that I am really not sure how I am going to get them all down and recall them.... So let me attempt to recall my motives for wanting death opposed to life. My life is going to be tremendously difficult (painful, humiliating) to live (work, social) I am an incredibly envious person I want particular things out of life that I am coming to discover are simply out of my league for a person of my capabilities. I am unwilling to adjust my basic goals or standards for a good life I refuse to live out my life as a pathetic individual I don't want my only existence to be a nightmare, a world gone wrong. I don't like myself for things I cannot change (mental speed etc) Life doesn't have much to offer a person like me. I believe suicide to be just in many circumstances, and in some cases honorable. (but still selfish) I will expand on my points and problems upon request.",
288,"I want to die Hi. If it matters, I'm 16 years old. Sorry for my bad English :/ Since I was a little kid I've been depressed and had suicidal thoughts tho at that time i was always hoping to get killed but not killing myself. My dad always used to beat me up about every little thing, i remeber he used to luck me up in a room and get in occasionally to hit me. I'm now standing my ground and I'm even fighting back. i used to cry myself to sleep until but i just don't care anymore. I have no friends, at all and the people that do hang out with me are shitheads who always talk shit about me behind my back. I never had a girlfriend and i probably never will. I'm fat and ugly too damn shy or lazy too do anything about low self-esteem problems. I'm a real asshole too. Fighting with people and making them hate me even more. I might be wrong but it looks like all the people that know me either hate me or just don't give a damn. My family don't give a damn about me and it seems like if i'll die no one will even care. I've lost my trust at people and i don't think i'll ever regain it. I've tried killing myself twice, once in the age of 12 and the second time in the age of 14. Needless to say i failed. I feel so empty, so shallow. My grades at school are getting really low and i'll probably won't even get a graduation certificate. About 2 years from now i'll need to go to the army(in Israel it's a must) and my childhood would come to an end. I've done nothing in my life and it just seems wasted, i don't think i can ever repair the damage i've caused and even if i can, i don't even know where to start. I've given up and am too afraid to try and commit suicide again 'cause i'm afraid i'll be a handicap for the rest of my life or paralyzed or something. Please don't advise me to seek professional help, i've already talked to a psychologist at the hospital and they are just complete assholes. That's kinda it. Sorry for the length.",

290,"What can I say to help Hi everyone, I recently have a new boyfriend. I'm crazy about him. I think he's great and we're good together. There's only one thing that really worries me and scares me. From the day I met him he has always said he's going to commit suicide. He says once his tasks are complete ( like paying his debts, finishing some music projects) he'll do it. He also says he's not on schedule. He really seems to idealize it. We've talked about it several times. He sees it as his final piece of art. He has depressive tendencies, but isn't heavily depressed, so it seems. He has a loving and caring family. So I don't quite understand. When I ask him why he would want to do it. He says because I've done all I've wanted to do. And that's the only thing that you're free in. And that when it happens I should be happy for him. Being his girlfriend I couldn't help but say what about me? My life would be ruined. I don't what to make him feel guilty, but how could I be happy for him??? And maybe it's selfish of me to want him alive. But isn't that kind of selfishness allowed? I really like him, but I'm scared and often wonder if I should turn around and run...so that I won't be scarred for life. Ofcourse that is not what I want to do. Not at all. I would love to talk him out of it. But how? What can I say or do that might help? Convincing arguments without making him feel guilty? What would really help? This has really been keeping me busy.",
291,"In the bigger picture nothing what we do matters I wish I'd never wake up. I don't see point in living. I'm very critical and like almost nothing. I don't even like most of the foods, I barely eat. I'm just skin and bones. I don't like people, in fact I find dislike about 90% of the population. There's nothing that has ever gave me joy. I feel like the society is rotten and even pork pigs are probably happier with their lives without having to worry about tomarrow. I feel like there's no greater reason for my existence other that not breaking the heart of my close ones (family). I wish every member of society had a ""raison d'être"". Like in the anime ""Ergo Proxy"", if anyone's seen it. If suicide was simple as making a ""mouseclick"" I would have definately committed one long time ago. I dunno why I even post here...",
292,"Life holds no value. I'm in college and have a rather good life. I've been provided everything I need to go out and get a good job, I've got good friends and family and good health. The issue is that that I see no point in living. There is no point in being here. We are infinitely insignificant in relation to the universe as a whole. The time humanity will last is not but a mere moment of forever. So why live? If I do or don't, it won't make any real difference. It may matter to friends and family for years, but they can't care forever. Eventually they'll get over or die off. The dead have no cares. Everyone tells me, ""Make your own purpose."" What good is that? No purpose I could make for myself could ever matter. Of the people I've talked with personally, few understand my perspective. The few that do all just as me, ""Why not live?"" or ""Live because life is enjoyable."" Well life's not all just easy. There are great time, but for those to stay, one must work. To have money to go out and do things, you need a job. To keep good relationships, you've got to do what everyone else wants to do from time to time. If there's no intrinsic value to life, what's the point in putting forth the effort to make it enjoyable? It would be so much simpler just to quit. To be dead requires no effort, no worries, no troubles. A few weeks ago, I had all my plans worked out. I was going to kill myself. I drove to my location, wrote out all my notes, had all my preparations made. All that was left was to get in the car with the gas 200 miles from home or anyone that cared. But I didn't. In the last moments I couldn't help but to think I could be wrong. I sat for an hour just thinking that it was going to be some life changing experience. I would go home and be a new person. Someone who wouldn't care about reasons or logic and would just look at life as beautiful. That didn't happen. I'm the same person I was. I ended up doing a medical withdraw from that semester of college. I spent a week in the hospital. My psychiatrist didn't believe me to be depressed (nor did/do I) and no medication was prescribed. I've had weekly counseling. My parents are always asking me how I'm doing, but I feel no different. I really just want to take a couple weeks to go out, have a great time then kill myself off. I can't right now though. I've seen my mother cry at the thought of loosing me and I can't get past it. I'm sure I could if I secluded myself for a few days or weeks. It would just be so much easier if I cared anything about my life. To only choose to live because I don't want to hurt people rather sucks. If I'm going to live too much longer, my believes must drastically change. I see no way for that to happen though. I've been listening to other perspectives, reading and researching, but nothing can convince me anything else. Death isn't bad. It happens to us all. Why can't I choose when? Why must I wait? Why is it selfish of me to take my life, but not selfish of you to demand I keep it?",
293,"Very very down I'm really struggling at the moment. I see my therapist twice a week now. And seeing my psychiatrist next week. I really think that I need to switch one of my medications. I been drinking here and there. But I feel so worthless these days, so insignificant, like I don't really exist. The self hatred is really strong. I been self harming again. I feel like I cannot relate to anyone and that no one can relate to me. I believe I am beyond help and hope. I am too fucked up. I feel very isolated, paranoid about others, think I would be better off dead; suicidal ideations. I don't know what to do anymore.",
294,"Maybe the time has come. I don't know if anyone who knows my story still is still around. Basically my circumstance circulates my controlling parent and a job they've forced me into doing. I've held on for so long but I think the time has finally come to a point where I can no longer deal with it anymore. I don't want to let go of my friends but my suffer won't end, I have no way to continuing any longer. Once upon a time I had hopes and dreams, but now it's all over.",
295,"i should kill myself. i look ugly af Been thinking it for long time, just can't keep it in anymore, just is there even point of living? World is only about looks, it's like an apple , people pick how they look or phones just how good they look, people really don't give a fuck how people personality or how they inside are, it's just too bad to watch if your classmates hang out with girls and you just sit on table alone, people say that there are people who care about personality and don't give a fuck about look , there isn't people like it, only maybe people who are called as ""Gold Diggers"", All that matters is look, but I just wanna know if it's worth killing myself?.",
296,"i am back at square one you know, around the summer time, i genuinely felt normal again, like i never went through depression, i feel like my mind has blocked out everything that ever happened before and i actually felt happy then. The sun were shining and i had everyone around me. But now i feel the walls crumbling again. I have a secret that i need to tell someone but i cant. i dont know why, but its destroying me. no body knows, not even my closest friend, not even my family no one, only i know and my diary that holds it knows. i feel so silly, this has gone on for too long and im just keeping it inside. i wish i could lead a normal life. i knew suicide would be inevitable but in the summer i just thought maybe it would never happen to me. but now that im back in ""reality"" (work/education) i realise that yes, yes i will commit suicide. but when is the question. i feel i do not belong in life on this world. i do not fit in. i am not normal. there is no cure for me. the only permanent treatment i could give myself would be to end it all. i am not at the stage where i feel i must go to extremes to kill myself right now, this second, however i am in that development stage; where i realise that this is my destiny and that i must begin planning. for too long i have ignored what was meant to be, thinking that it wasnt right. but suicide is for me, it is what was intended. i feel so hopeless, i feel like the life im currently living isnt real and that it doesnt matter if i fuck up because then i can kill myself and nothing will matter, everything will be forgotten. i dont understand why people like me, or want to be my friend. i feel silly for degrading myself, after all, everyone in this world was the same when they were born, innocent, naive, unaware. it is where we go from there that changes us all and my route was a very rocky, dangerous path with a dead end not too far down. and i feel i am almost at the end, almost. not quite but soon approaching. so i shall have to see whether the weather will change or if i stay in this same, horrific state of mind. goodnight, i shall go to bed now",
297,"Is it Hopeless? (Be honest) All my life I have been that worthless person that nobody could care less about. Just that second class loser that people don't even consider or desire. Honestly I'm not a bad person and I never did anything wrong. I don't deserve this at all. I don't want this. I know people here will laugh at me and mock me to make me feel worse but I don't care. I have nobody to turn to except the internet because I'm just some worthless person nobody wants. The fact is my existence does not matter to and benefit anyone. I think I have a lot of potential but I am very unlucky. I can no longer tolerate or have any energy left inside me to be that worthless loser that nobody cares about. I never asked for this. Never. I never did anything wrong. I never hurt anyone. For the first time in my life Suicide is actually becoming a REAL and SERIOUS option for me. What's the point if you will just be some inferior laughingstock and alone for the rest of your life? I have no obligation to anyone for this life therefore I don't have to live as the worthless inferior loser. I don't choose that life. I never did. Never will. But what the fuck do I do??? How do I undo this nightmare? I don't want to live like this. I am the kind of person that nobody cares about. That nobody would ever actually choose to want or desire. A successful person with self respect and a good life that is. I am the kind of person nobody ever thinks of or cares about. All my life I have never been loved or wanted by one person. Not one person. Never in my life has anyone actually ""wanted"" or ""chose"" to be with me or had any ""desire"" to be with me if that makes sense. Like I said I'm just that person nobody could care less whether dies or not. You can say that I am only 20 and still young but I feel like it's already to late. I feel like my personality has already been far too damaged enough to be a normal person. I feel like I have missed the train if that makes sense. Just a dumb analogy. People here can lie and say they care but it's not true. I have never had a girl I like or wanted actually ever have any interest in me or liked me. Never had sex even. I never even kissed a girl before. That's how sad and pathetic my life is. Go ahead and laugh and mock me all you want. I won't lie anymore. I have never been in love with a girl that loved me back. I have never had a true friend in my life. I have always been that powerless loser that just about anyone can take advantage of and discard at will. I don't care what anyone here says. The bottom line is: I do NOT want to be like this. I do NOT want to be a pathetic inferior loser anymore. I don't know how to change this. Is it hopeless after all? Am I doomed for a life alone? Am I doomed to be an inferior laughingstock for the rest of my life? Will I ever be normal? Hell look at normal peoples lives. Normal people have tons of relationships, fall in love, have real friends, have people who actually care about and want them, are not powerless like me, Are good looking, are free and happy (able to loudly express themselves and attract others) are traveling the world and happy whereas I am just some loser nobody knows or cares about. I'm so miserable. What should I do? How do I find people I actually want? How will a girl I like ever want a loser like me when there are so many better options? Help. Please Help",

Other 10 percent is done by youngest daughter. oldest daughter and son are mega lazy and do nothing.

My only options are misery, abandoning this ""family"" of which ""depend"" upon me and making me feel like a sack of crap, or putting it to an end.

I've been lurking on this suicide threads a lot because I feel the same and have been thinking of ending my life for a long time. There is not a day that goes by I don't think about killing myself. I think about it every night in the darkness alone... Every day Alone... The reason I want to kill myself is because I am so behind and inferior. I am 19 years old already and still a virgin. Never had a girlfriend and I have severe Social Anxiety. I've been bullied mercilessly and relentlessly since the age on 13 and it ruined my personality. Because of it I have developed various mental illnesses including Social Anxiety. I am a racial minority where I live and I feel like my Race is inferior as well. I wish I was white then I could be somebody at least. Everyone I try to talk to ignores me and treats me like a third wheel. Nobody cares that I exist. I am a complete nobody. I appear boring and weird to normal people due to my SA and ugliness. I can't take this. Why do some people have such and Easy life but not me? I deserve to be happy too. I never hurt anyone or did anything bad. Nobody accepts me though. I am second rate and an outcast wherever I go. I am so alone and so lonely. Thinking about putting an end to things. There isn't hope. I just want to be loved and important... I just want to be normal,

I know it sucks for his family but i just dont see a point in my life it´s so empty and boring every day is the same lonely and painful. Im 24 years old never had a girlfriend im pretty sure i never will,friends that i have are not rly my real friends just ppl i know and hang out with,every day i wake up tired,feeling like crap and have some thouths thinking how someone in my family dies of some disaease or some other scenario and start to cry for some time just becouse of that before i realize it´s not real.I could never afford school even if i did i dont think im smart to finish it my job options are limited to one or two at max so i hate my job,i live in a country that´s destoryed by a war.I see ppl arround me happy enjoying theryr lifes and i think to myself after all the mistakes ive done i managed to ruin my life.Now it´s over there is nothing only thing i hate about myself i dont have the currage to do it yet to finish this crap. It´s been 2 years now and not a day goes by that i dont think about killing myself. I see a car or a train coming and i start to talk to myself is this the second i will decide to end this please be it so i can end this but as you see i dont have the currage yet. My guess is brain needs certain amount of time to get used to the fact i want to end this i was hoping by the time 2 years expire i will made my peace with it but it has not happend yet. I know it will happen just dont want to wait another 2 years.I want to expire soon as possible. Sorry for the crappy spelling.",
307,"mmf. so I told her. I told her and it annoys me. I told her that I have flashes - almost daily.. just thoughts. ""I want to go away"" and I chase those thoughts away immediately, but still, they return, just the same, later that day, or the next morning... I'm just so tired. and I told her that I've been like this for months.. she knows. she asks and i don't want to answer her, and she knows. and I feel bad. i reassure her that I won't do anything, I promise, promise, promise.. that they are just thoughts, just flashes - that I don't entertain anymore. but they're still there. I don't think that they will ever go away entirely. I've been like this for so long, ever since I heard at 13/14 that a 16 year-old neighbor committed suicide. it affected people he didn't even know, let alone people he knew to varying degrees. and the idea comforted me. to know that there was an escape, an end. and that maybe people would care, would help... but back then i was afraid that they'd just forget me. cos I was so quiet/withdrawn you see. now, many years later, the thoughts are still there. they got much worse... much. and better. and I don't entertain them anymore. but they still don't go away. i feel bad bc she's depressed too. and bc I work so much. bc I'm not home enough to hug her like she needs me to. not home enough to tell her that it will be okay, that she can work on this.. and I'm so tired. I've been so overwhelmed, for months now. months. stressed and scared and tense.. and I don't think that I could have done this without her. a fact, perhaps. idk. maybe i just needed to vent.

310,"Descending I'm a 20 year old male. Over the past 9 years I've struggled with consistent severe depression and suicidal feelings. There has always been and always is within me a strong feeling that something is bubbling under, that I'm on the brink of getting too sick of it all and doing away with myself. Most of the time, I conceal these feelings and behave relatively normally, except for the occassional glance into nothingness as I drift off into dark thoughts without checking myself. Sometimes the sadness grows so overwhelming that every moment becomes an agonising struggle in which I feel I must decide whether to ""do it"" or ""not do it"". Many times I've been on the brink of suicide for days, weeks, months. I've destroyed everything I own with a hammer countless times, including expensive valuables, and even when I've done it before and regretted it I've done it all over again. I've lay catatonic in bed for weeks, not washing, barely eating, leaving my teeth to rot, not even looking out of my bedroom window. In my depression I've shattered the few friendships I've had, and those I did not shatter withered away out of my lack of enthusiasm for other human beings. I've had educational opportunities but I quickly lose enthusiasm for them and ultimately fail despite having ability. I do not live a hopeless existence. I was just recently given an unconditional offer to attend one of the world's best universities purely on the basis of my talent despite having next to no qualifications. I am in good overall physical health. I'm OK looking, and have been told many times that I have ""swagger"" and ""charisma"", though I know full well that it's a pretense, the only way I know of to hide my misery from other people. A few times I've dropped all pretenses and been frank about who I am and what I feel - that hasn't worked out so well. I've come to learn that people prefer the charade, even those who claim to love me. Anyway, my point is, I know full well that I am priveleged, compared to many. What disturbs me is that I simply don't care, because I have no enthusiasm for life. I have interests and hobbies, but they are hardly worth living for. I know people, but they, too, are not worth living for. If I could, I would forget about forming attachments, forget about enthusiasm for anything and just drift along through life in my indifference, but alas, I cannot do that. I feel too heavily burdened, for I am always weighed down by guilt, regret and doubt. I can never recover from the past. For example, I lost my only real friend over two years ago after an argument and it still torments me every day. Nor can I ever look forward to the future, because it is my natural tendency to expect history to repeat itself and for the same misfortunes to recur in my life. I feel that I am destined to be unhappy regardless of what fortunes befall me. Ultimately I see no reason to continue. I am not mentally ill and have no personality disorder, so I have no interest in seeking medical ""treatment"" and no delusion that said ""treatment"" will lead to any kind of improvement. I recognise that my unhappiness is directly connected to my core personality traits. Truth be told, I don't know why I'm posting this... I guess I just want to see what people have to say.

312,"Sick of life and people. So im at a crossroads right now, im 18 male i have a great job , good pay, benifits, the whole deal. I also just moved out on my own 2 months ago. Ive been depressed for a few years, highschool was horrible, i was expelled for drug possesion about half way through my senior year. Finished up at another school though and graduated, but thats not the reason it was horrible, I wasnt bullied or anything, i was just a total loner, completly antisocial. I had 1 friend but he got sick of my pessimistic attitude towards everything and eventually drifted away. My childhood was good, until my parents got divorced, some 5 years ago. And since then shit has gone downhill. Empty, lonely, tired, i know people notice becasue my face looks like death, heavy dark circles under my eyes, i have no emotion when i speak, i have no interests. When I wake up on my days off, i just wallow around my empty apartment all day. Its hard to explain how i feel, it truely is the worst kind of suffering, being isolated. Knowing there are others living, loving, socializing, Its hard to just stand up and go meet people, i wish it was that easy. I know this post wont do anything either, i guess the minor satisfaction of others knowing what im going through is somewhat comforting. Not to be smug, but i envy ""stupid people"" who just look at things the way they want to see them, living blindly in there own little happy world. And they just roll with it. As much as i despise ""sheep"" i sometimes want to be one. I have an addiction, not to drugs, a different type of addiction, a guilty, nasty, pathetic, addiction. One i love and crave, but also despise Im not going to explain though (Yeah its that low and vile). I sometimes wonder if this ""addiction"" is a reflection of my OCD. But what do i know im no psychiatrist. The mysteries of life and death have always facinated me, im not religious (go figure right? He hates the government and is an athiest) Im no liberal either if thats what your all leaning towards right now. But thats beside the point. I was raised catholic, accept god, fear god, love god and you will go to heaven and lead a happy life. Obviously that didnt work out in my favor so therefore i start to denie god. I dont like being looked at as a stupid teenage kid who is a complete ignoramus about the world, when the person making that accusation knows nothing about me or what they are talking about. Why would it matter if im 18 and there 40, knowledge is not obtained by years. Anyways im getting off topic, Why should I keep living like I do? Whats the point of living when you dont FEEL anything? When you dont care if you live or die, will it ever end? The sadness the dark feeling that lurks inside of you day and night? It sounds like a cliche but its painfully true. Im very close to ending it, and frankly I dont see why I shouldnt. Replies would be greatly appreciated",

I don't know how some ppl are so damn good at social, I wish I can be like that. People likes to be with people who are good at socialising. People don't like to be with me coz I'm shy and stupid. Coz I say things that make people don't know how to respond. Coz sometimes I try too hard to speak and screw everything up. I hate myself so much. I hate it I hate it I hate it. Since infanthood, I'm always being compared to my cousin Amy who are totally the opposite to me. She's outgoing and has a natural talent in socialising but she's stupid in study. I'm shy but get good marks in school. So what, my good marks means nothing, my music and cooking talent means nothing and my good heart means nothing becoz people love her but people don't love me. She's always surrounded by people and I'm always transparent alone in the corner. I hate myself so much. I would rather be shit at everything else but have a good social skill. I hate it.

315,"Scared of getting worse Even though I feel like shit sometimes, I'm not suicidal, yet. I'm scared because the lows are getting worse and worse lately. What if they get low enough to where I make a stupid decision? Little things are triggering me faster than usual and where I feel really bad. I don't think it's a good sign that I wouldn't mind dying now if it happened naturally. I don't think I could handle feeling worse than some of my past lows. It's especially hard since I have no one to talk to in real life. Opening up to anyone my age would push them away. My Mom is already worried about me and I can't make her feel any worse. Free college counseling is out of the question and I don't have any money for a paid therapist. I've tried them anyway before and it didn't help at all. Talking to people here is nice, but I can't live off of writing to people I'll never see. I need someone real, even just one person. I don't want to die. There's a lot I want to do with my life. I really want a wife and kids. But nonetheless, I'm scared of what I'll do to myself if I hit a new low. I've overdosed before (I know it was dumb), not necessarily to kill myself, but just because I didn't see a reason not to at the time. I don't cry a lot, but I can't help but get a little teary-eyed writing/reading this. I never thought that I would get this bad, so it's hard to see that I couldn't get worse than this. I feel bad having these feelings when I read about so many other stories way worse than mine here, and those people are getting better. It makes me feel weak and selfish. I'm scared that I'll make that final mistake that I can't take back.",

332,"I feel like doing drugs to end my fucked up life... My life is in a state of prolonged numbness , I don't seem to have any strong emotions anymore and it sucks. I just don't feel like doing anything - I spend 95% of my day in bed either sleeping, watching tv or internet (mainly youtube) - I only get up to eat, drink and go to the toilet. I still have no close friends and hate myself everytime I think about the state of my life . I know I should eat healthy, do exercise, learn new stuff and clean my flat and finish the decorating (that has been going for the last 5 years and still no where near completion), but I just can't seem to change myself. I have seriously been contemplating taking drugs - I have not taken drugs to get high before (except alcohol and that is a substance I particularly don't like); the best drug for me is heroin. The salt compound diacetylmorphine hydrochloride that constitutes one of the forms of heroin seems to be particularly clean in its side effects, but incredibly addictive . I hate living this life that is so empty without any good feelings, at least I feel taking this drug will give me short term highs or the strength (during the comedown period) to at least end my shit life. I don't want my mind to be more fucked than it already is and this drug seems like the best candidate; other drugs have worse physical side effects or cause paranoid delusions and schizophrenia. I feel like I am in a mental hole that can't get out of, I need something to stimulate me, but the stimulant drugs like ice or cocaine would fuck my body and mind too much and I don't want to lose the sense of myself; herion is a relaxant and narcotic rather than stimulant and causes feeling of euphoria . The only thing stopping me from taking it right now is I don't trust any of the dealers - they cut it with so much nasty shit I am more likely to die slowly from that rather than diacetylmorphine itself , and that is not the way I want to die. I would rather make the herion myself except that pure opimum and precursor chemicals are hard to come by, and if I do get busted they would probably think I am trying to sell it instead of using myself, which would mean longer jail time and the end of my working life . It is much easier to buy that shit off the street but far more damaging to life and health becuase everybody wants to make a profit and that means fucking over the customers, addicts just want a fix and don't particularly care about their health or the future, so they are hooked for life whilst arsehole dealers fix prices and keep quality low to maintain their profit . I know taking drugs won't make me a better person, but I really want to experience some form of good feelings again and I just can't motive myself to be better and get out of the mental rut that has dominated my whole existence. And I am too much of a relusive loser to make any friends or pursue romantic interests . In my state of mental numbness I think about a lot of things even about the existence of a god (as so many people of religion believe), but it just doesn't make any sense to me - why would a god try to hide itself if it really exists. I would have always thought anything with great power and control would always make itself unambiguous to its subjects. I tried praying and asking any god to inform me of its presence for the majority of my shit life but none has ever responded and there have been some shit times in my life . It only brings me to the final conclusion that no god ever existed and there is no evidence to support its existence apart from other humans saying it exists - and I don't particularly trust what humans say unless I can corroborate it myself! I don't believe in a human sole or that humans are some how greater than any other lifeform on this planet - that is just self-righteous bullshit, humans have single-handedly fucked this planet in more ways than one; they killed, exploited and abused almost all other life on this planet for their own gain and if there was a god it should have done something about it by now (but it obviously does not exist). Everything that we are is defined by our physical substance - even the mind is defined by the physical structure of the brain and biological processes that take place within it, that is so evident if you look at the effects of brain damage on people and how personality is affected by it. My conclusion is that a person ceases to exist completely after death - there is no after-life and no sole to be transported to another medium. When your body and brain cease to function you no longer exist in any form. Changes to your physical substance (e.g. disability in some way) also change you as a person (though it depends on the injury as to the impact of the mental change), so a brain without a body theoretically does not have the same personality as the same brain with a body - as there is a lot of sensory input from different parts of the body as well as motor control (muscle movement) and personality is affected by this stimulation and feedback as well as to a lesser extent the processes that don't require thought (e.g. breathing, heartbeat and hormonal secretions), as feedback processes are quite complex and there are overlapping functions by different regions of the brain. All in all the more I think about it the more clear it becomes that no god exists and therefore there is nothing to help you in times of crisis apart from yourself or other lifeforms. The only other lifeforms that can make any significant difference in my life are other humans, but it so hard for me to form any close relationships with them. I am also disgusted by the human race and its continued attitude of callousness and selfishness towards non-human lifeforms and its continued destruction of the most bio-diverse habitats on both land and sea. Also its continued programs of animal slaughter to control wildlife instead of controlling human population expansion onto these animal's natural habitat. In my lifetime I have seen the human population increase by over 1 billion to the utter detriment of other life that exists on this planet and it saddens me greatly . I am as hyprocrytical as them all as I continue to live in human society (albeit in the fringes) but still endorse this form of human behaviour by buying goods, food (I am vegetarian though) and services from humans who exhibit and encourage this wrong behaviour. I am weak mentally as I don't want to upset the status quo and I know I can't cope with backlash (as I have experienced so many times in the past) if I choose to challenge people - I guess I am just a messed up person who can't seem to change. I feel like taking drugs to escape my reality because in the end I feel nobody is going to help me anyway and I can't face up to the immorality of human behaviour or rationalise my past experiences.",
333,"Feeling out of control.. So here's the post I promised earlier about where I'm at. I could have probably put this in the depression section, but I didn't want to risk triggering anyone. Also, sorry it's novel-length. I just needed to get it all out. Basically, I've been suffering symptoms of bipolar disorder since I was younger than 10. I had early-onset rapid cycling mood swings and bad behavior for most of my childhood. My grandmother was once treated for generalized anxiety, and flushed her medication claiming ""god would save her"" (her father was a priest). Needless to say, with her and my hypercontrolling religious father in control of my life, even the thought that I could have a psychological problem wasn't a possibility. I was always the kid who ""needed an attitude adjustment"". However, I was also always the ""smart"" kid, the one who'd be a doctor. I got great grades without trying at much of anything, other than math, and that was only when it got really hard. I graduated high school with honours, got awards, was leader of our glee choir, concert band, etc. I was the kind of person people either loved or hated. I had a tonne of friends, people I got along with well, people who perpetually owed me a favour, because I would never say no to anything. (Usually worst during a manic cycle. During highschool, I generally only had hypomanic episodes, but they could last for two weeks). I had a good group of very close friends, most of whom I still talk to regularly. My best girlfriend and I are still thick as thieves. But even they don't know anything about how I really feel. I was always confident, vain, usually arrogant and controlling. Group projects were me telling people what to do, and then usually doing most of it for them. Unfortunately, this also meant I rarely attracted anyone that I at least reciprocated to as a romantic interest. When a young man I had met through a friend courted me, I accepted his attempts to date me. Worst choice of my life thus far, I think. He was an ass. A lazy prick with no respect. He cheated on me, left me for another woman and then came crawling back. And I took him back. Time and again, I put myself through that hurt. I wish I knew why. It doesn't make sense now, but I did. My parents hated him, so our relationship was rocky there, too. He triggered a lot of massive depressive states in me. I'd say those started being the worst once I started dating him. So I hit major depressive states at 9, 13, 15, 17, 18, 19, and now 20, sometimes having more than one a year. (By Major depressive, I mean lasting more than two weeks.) I came to college in 2008/9, and decided to try a long distance relationship. Shit idea. I also started having terrible allergic symptoms, waking up with my entire body covered in rash, feeling extremely lethargic and awful. Months of diagnostics turned up nothing. My grades were torched, even after dropping several classes. Second semester, nothing improved. I failed out, was kicked out of my faculty, and went home a failure for the first time in my life. I'd never felt so disgusting. There were weeks I wouldn't leave my dorm room. I was sick, and no one could help me, I was failing and no matter how much I studied I couldn't improve anything. My relationship failed, I had no friends. I halfheartedly attempted suicide then, no one but my current partner knows. The hospital didn't even run an evaluation on me. At the end of that summer, I transferred faculties, and was somewhat more successful. After being diagnosed with celiac, I started eating better, lost some weight, and started feeling a lot better. First semester went well, but in 2010, I began feeling terrible again. Isolated, lethargic, hopeless. There were days where I would stay in bed and just weep all day because I didn't know what else to do. I finally checked myself in to be evaluated through the school, already surmising that I had bipolar disorder (I'm a student of psychology). After a 3 month eval., I finally got diagnosed and referred to a psychiatrist, who, lucky me, didn't start for yet another month. My grades that term were mediocre, and I didn't go home to live with my parents that summer, as I had a job and lease at school. I broke up with my boyfriend after a few long weeks of insane tension, and got more involved with music again through extracurriculars. I thought things were falling into place. I met a new guy, an amazing man. He's truly excellent, and has helped a lot. I'm happy in my faculty, got offered an apprenticeship, had a job, finally got evaluated and put on a low dose of Epival, followed by Celexa (when we realized the mania had stopped, but the depression had not). This term was great at the beginning. Great work ethic, excited about possibilities, had new friends and great plans, the new boy and everything was working how it was supposed to. Then I started slipping again. Started gaining a lot of weight, got behind in school. I thought I was just sick, then I thought I was just overtired, then I thought I had mono. For most of October I didn't even bother to leave my house for more than an hour. I went in to the doctor, and she was bloody useless. Booked back in with my psychiatrist finally, but still haven't seen him. I keep on breaking down. I feel helpless. I can't lose weight. I've gotten so frustrated I've just stopped eating to try and get it to go away. I feel disgusting. I'm tired all the time. I have no interest in anything. My grades are atrocious, and I had to cut my hours back by half just to have a hope of catching up. The other night I called a distress line, and she was useless. It got to the point where I had my suicide note and informal will written, the pills, liquor and knife out by my bed, and a bag with a week of clothes and all my money packed by the front door in case I decided to go with plan B and just run away. I don't know what to do. The chances of recovery from bipolar are 16%. The rate of suicide amongst us is 11%. What's the point in even trying to get better anymore? How many times can I plead with the chairs of my school to give me special treatment before they realize it's not the circumstances, it's just me? I feel like if it's always going to be like this, if I'll always feel this way, I'd rather die now than keep going. I can't keep going.",
334,"Won't, but REALLY want to.

Now all those things are gone, and it feels like my life is basically ruined. I took so many things for granted, it seems I don't know the value of something until it's removed from me.

She contridicts everything I say. Like when I told her that I only cut when I'm depressed she asked me why I cut and if it's because I ""Need control"" as if I never told her the real reason. She just wont listen I don't need control I just need a good distraction from my missary. But telling her that does no good. Today if she does want to talk I'm not going to tell her anything I'm just going to talk about my poems or something lame like that because like I said telling her about my cutting does no good.",

My mother was worried for me, so she took me to many therapists, none of whom were able to help me. Instead, they just listened and pretended to care. Stopped wasting my money. It was then that I realized that nobody in this world gives a damn about you. To them, you only matter if you are useful, otherwise you're ignored. It's the harsh reality. I also realized that I could solve my own problems or I could live and suffer till i die. My issues are unsolvable so I'd rather suffer instead. I'm still alive, had enough of this agony and pain.

351,"Exipiration Time Hello. Without going into tremendous detail, I will just throw it out there and say that I've come to a point where I do not feel that I can benefit my family, my self or society any longer, thus it is time for me to go. Come this January (2015) I will have been out of work for 2 years. Since January of 2013, I have sent hundreds of resumes and applications out with no luck. I have sent them out of state, in-state and locally. It seems that when one reaches my age (mid 40's) one is really not marketable. For the most part this is a fact. Plus, the unfortunate choice of profession does not help either as it is really (with a few exceptions) a loser all around. Initially, when I was let go I thought the opportunity would be good to start my own business, which I did. After more than a year and only a small amount of work coming in I decided to get into something else, which I did this past Spring into now. Currently, this new venture is not working either. All of this combined with 2 children and a wife to support, have brough me to the conclusion that it may be better just to let my self go as state support may be better for them at least in the short term, as my wife is more marketable with her profession. There is much more to this than just what I say above, as I have been depressed for years. Yes, I've been to therapists, and it did not work out, and yes, I tried to commit suicide just over 10 years ago (ironically, one month later my brother was successful in killing himself). People say that ""as long as you have health, friends and family you don't need anything else"". Over the years I have come to see that such words are really crap. Here in the u.s.a it is and will always be about money. Without it, you can't survive, socially you become that guy, or those people who others feel sorry for, etc.. The list goes on and on. We are conditioned to grow up, and go to school, and then pay a sh.it load of money for a college degree that sends us out to a saturated work place to push paper with the rest of the zombies. Most of us have no real skills to fall back on. It is sad, but reinforces the fact that I have lost the game. In about a year's time, we will have exhausted all of our savings, and will have to move on to the next phase, which will be some type of government support (welfare?). This is just not a place I want to be. Failure seems unavoidable, so why waste any more air or space on the planet at this point? That is all for now. Thank you for listening.",

359,"Game Over Hi! My name is Karina, I'm 32 and I want to die. I have had suicidal thoughts for years, but now I feel that I'm ready to die. First of all, even though I have two jobs, I can't even pay a rent (I live in a big city so rents are extremely expensive), and salaries are super low. I live in my brother's apartment, with my grandmother. He just moved out with his SO, but sometimes comes here. I contribute as much as I can, but still, it's not enough. So that's the first problem, it seems very unlikely that I could get a well paid job. I don't have any friends or close relatives besides my grandmother and my brother. For her, I'm not enough, she criticizes everything I do, I'm the worst person, a liar, even though I'm the only one who takes care of her. Then, my brother has told me several times that I should commit suicide. Then, there is my ex best friend. I fell in love with him, but he didn't feel the same. I begged him to give me a chance, so we started kind of a relationship. He told me that he had fell in love with me, but then, a few months ago, he confessed that he hates me since the time I told him that I loved him and that he only wanted me to die or commit suicide (he asked this several times). Both have told me that they were angry, and that they didn't feel so. But even if they hadn't said that, I'd feel the same: I want to die. I have no goals, no hobbies, basically, nothing to live for. I have felt numb for years, but I was excited about living with my boyfriend. I have been in love with him for ten years, I've met tons of boys, but I just can't. I love him. I used to have other friends, just a few, but now, all of them are busy with their children and their partners. Also, I suffered from bullying when I was a kid, because I was ugly. But then, four years ago, I fainted and broke my left orbit, so I had a reconstructive surgery, now I'm uglier. And no, plastic surgery is not an option for me, because I have a cicatrization problem. I force myself to do things, but I feel emotionally and physically tired all the time. Eating and sleeping have become my addiction and I know this is, in part, why I feel tired. I tried the whole healthy lifestyle for months: meditation, exercise, healthy food, new things, but it didn't work. I just feel very guilty for leaving my cat, I know for some people is stupid, but he's the best 'thing' I have. It seems that I have existential laziness, more than depression. Thanks for reading!",

361,"Just Let me leave I have not been feeling right ever since someone important to me passed away 8 months ago. I was not able to tell anyone, not even my closest friends or relatives, as I live in a country where marriage between our kinds were prohibited. He had been my source of inspiration, and we basically could talk about anything under the sun. He was always cheerful, and always told me to be confident in whatever I do. I always felt I was worthless until he made me see the good in me. He was from a very wealthy family and didnt look down on a person like me, unattractive, dumb and poor. He was very charming and I felt like he was an angel sent by the heavens. I always wondered what was in me that he saw, that he loved for 6 whole years. Happy moments did not last long. He was in the last stage of cancer when he was diagnosed (esophagus cancer, which had spread to the rest of his body). Weirdly, he seemed healthy the past few years. I will always remember his last smile to me before he passed, a weak smile seeming to tell me to be brave and strong. After he passed on, I couldn't concentrate on my work, and quit last May, as I did not want to affect the project deadline, and I just couldnt find a motivation to live on. I decided to commit suicide, and I found a suicide method. Last week I tried to commit suicide, but it did not work. For all of you who happen to read this, please help pray for me to leave this world. No one loves me as I am estranged from my family who think I am just worthless, no friends cos the only one love I had is no more there.

364,"Most people want me to kill myself Don't tell me I'm making this up in my head. Just moments ago I saw what is the most blatant statement yet that society WANTS me to commit suicide. I was about to make a thread ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? and say if this doesn't prove I have no choice besides suicide, I don't know what does. Yet I'd likely fall on deaf ears. Some people here are just going to laugh at my expense, making me out to be a running joke. Certainly the powers to be in society will. I wrote a post and the browser refreshed by itself for some reason, but what I was saying is, Most people want me to commit suicide. Either that or they consider me the laughing stock of all laughing stocks, that even if they have a bad day they can look at me as a greater failure and feel good about themselves. I'm not saying most people know me. But if the average person got to know me, there's a good chance they'll laugh, say ""go away loser!"" and walk away, and that's the minimum of insults. If you say I'm hallucinating, then what about the countless thousands of evidence I've seen. Often every day I see several new reasons for suicide like today. To those that say ""shut up, just admit you're wrong and you're brain dead"", you born-luckies are either just naive or know it's true and are laughing at me. My real problem isn't depression. It's that, as one said about my type, ""vermin are pure failures"". My problem is that I'm a disease. Not in depression as a disease, but that I AM a disease. A living virus that must be eradicated. A game once said ""the only cure for infestation is fire."" Taking it out of context, but it aptly describes my ilk: ""The only cure for failure is the sword."" Someone here said everyone has a calling. Well my calling is suicide. I am like a farm animal. I was born for the slaughterhouse. Some animals are born for a natural life, I am born for the slaughter. That's why thinking positively doesn't make a real difference. It's just pallative care. It doesn't change the setting I was born in. If you saw what I saw you'd know what I mean. The things I've seen, causing me to immediately injure myself on the spot and wishing to kill myself at the moment. I was born with a grave disadvantage as a loner and that means NO hope for me in today's world. I expect to get ridiculed for this thread.

The medication I'm on could take ages to work and I'm not having counselling yet (I have to wait). I went to see a mental health expert and she has made my life less worth living that it was before. I'm being forced to stay up all day and get up at a set time, have 3 meals a day and do 30 minutes exercise a day. I was slowely progressing but now I'm going backwards, I'm so run down that I'm now getting physically ill. I can understand why people cut themselves. I'm so lost at the moment, Dizmo x",

370,Terrified screwup Hi everyone. I've been hospitalized once for a suicide attempt bit have had several other attempts before and after that. I received a diagnosis of bipolar I which seems to explain a lot but what makes me sick is the possibility that I hide behind my bipolar as a way to explain whatever messed up things I've done. Maybe it's all in my head and I'm just the f**kup I'm convinced that I am. I spend most of my time making myself sick over the things I wish I could be as well as obsessing over times in the past in convinced were better. And they were. In my head I see myself as a better person and not the despicable person I see in the mirror everyday. I really am such a screwup and I seriously just think that myself and everyone else would be better off moving past the mess that I am. The only thing that keeps me going is my girlfriend. She saves my life every day. But she is the most wonderful person I've ever known and I just dread the day she wakes up and realizes all the grief that I cause her and everyone else. I'm just not worth it. I just can't see any other options and I feel like I did the day I made the attempt that landed me in the hospital. I guess because I'm posting this there is a part of me that wants to live but that part is getting smaller every day. Thanks everyone for your time. J,
371,"I can almost feel the relief already I have been feeling lousy for a few weeks, but this past week I feel like i'm in a huge black hole and am unable to get out. all day long the thoughts of suicide have been foremost in my mind, and it somehows makes me sigh a sigh of relief, then when I try to think about not doing it I get agitated and depressed. I just want to feel release.",
372,"Thats Me? What Happened? I started cutting when I was about 11 years old, and its now been 9 years. Wow, how time goes by. I remember that first time like it was yesterday. A few of my friends had started doin it so I thought that would try it to. It hurt so much and I couldnt understand why people did it. My boyfriend at the time got so mad at me, but thats what ended the fight that we were in. After a few months the craze of cutting yourself had passed amungst my friends and no one was doin it anymore, no one that is except for me. I started out din it on my thighs, then ran out of room, and it all went to shit from there. Now I wont leave my house without long pants and long sleeves on, even in the summer when it hits the 90s and 100s. I remeber my exboyfriend getting so mad at me for cutting and telling me that if he saw anymore cuts on me that we were through. So I thought, ""no biggy, Ill jus do it where you cant see it."" So I started cuttin my feet, yea tell me about it. I went to a residential and the staff there were actually scared of me. They later told me that they had never seen someone with so many scars on their body. They all had to attend special classes to learn how to deal with cutters. I am sad to say, that when I look at myself in the mirror the cuts overwhelm me. I see them and think, ""why did I ever do that to myself?"" But them 20 minutes later there I am with a razor in hand repeating the past. I honestly thought that by the time I got to be this age that this ""phase"" would be behind me, but I guess not. I guess Im writing this to reach out and actually ASK for some help something Ive never been able to do before in my whole life. I dont want to have to some day explain to my kids why mommy has nasty scars all over her body. If there is anyone out there who has cut, has stopped cutting, or still does cut, and can give me some insight and hope for myself it would be more than appreciated.",
373,"Life feels as if it's at crossroads right now First off i would like to say hi to everyone here this is my first post so i am a little nervous but hopefully someone can understand this or relate even. I am a 20 year old male who may look normal on the outside but inside and in my head i am really messed up/confused, when younger i always had a little anger deep down inside of me, however in the past year it has gotten worse to the point of suicidal thoughts and several failed attempts (I just couldn't go through with it) It started after i left college and decided i didn't want to take mechanical engineering into the 3rd year, now i am at the jobcentre every week. In all honesty i haven't tried my hardest, I am ashamed of what i have become. On a daily basis i get an adrenaline rush and dream of sorting all this stuff out and settling down with a woman and having a family, it feels all positive until the doubt, fear emotions settle in and i feel like the suicide is necessary to prevent it ever happening in the future especially in front of a partner or even worse a child. I feel trapped and feel like there isn't a way out but then the positive will kick in for a little bit, the negative just seems to be the majority right now.",

381,"New User, Regged Here As I am Feeling Bad I was considering burning my house down ten minutes ago, I'm feeling bad, I have no one to tell about my feelings, I have two people in my life who walk away as soon as I ask for help or mention anything that is not about them. I have a CPN who visits once a month for ""psychosocial counseling"" He thinks I'm malingering. My dad hit me when I was about six y o, I only rememberd about that last year when I was digging deep in my mind to try and find why I'm not right. I had blanked that out for over 48 years, I couldnt hear anything for a week, and I get chronic earache. In 2002 I was diagnosed with chronic stress, anxiety, depression and panic attacks, My most recent panic attack was on monday. I saw the CPN yesterday,(routine monthly) I think I'm Bi-polar, and autistic, I have done online tests which indicate so. But never diagnosed by a doc IRL. On saturday night, I was visited by a radiant angel, The angel came into my mind like a vision, The angel told me to ""fight for the truth"", Three times the angel said; ""fight for the truth"", I felt joy at this, but now I feel so depressed that I feel like I want to burn down the house, to move on to the next parallel. But the angel has told me I have to fight for the truth. How can I make anyone believe me if I have to fight for it. I'm a pacifist I hate fights and violence. I have so much to give, but I cant get anyone to listen, samaritans and breathing space hung up on me, the citizens advice bureau have banned me for no reason, The CPN is only interested in me filling in a ""how are we doing feedback evaluation form"". Please dont ask me for anything which may reveal my ID, as I have been attacked and am on a death list by some ex army gang. They have hacked my broadband and stolen my identity and spammed the world to make everyone hate me, This has placed me on many internet blacklists so I am cut off and isolated. Although the hack took place in 2010 I only discovered this a couple of months ago. I could type volumes about all the bad stuff, beatings, false allegations, attempted murder, high speed car crashes, falling off oilrigs, but it wont help really, So, one hour contact with a cpn in a month, thats it. That's my life. I have to go do an errand, I'll be back on later. thanks :)",

385,"Reasons to live, other than people Hi everyone! I've suffered from depression for as long as I can seem to remember. I think it's mostly because I've always felt so lonely. I've never been able to keep friends and am always fascinated and stupefied at how other people seem to so easily have large groups of friends, and even romantic partners!! I'm currently in graduate/professional school and am always surrounded by happy, outgoing people that are a part of a great community that I just don't feel very welcome in. When I am with people, I seem to either not speak enough (and come across as bored and disinterested or just boring, and am not invited back) or I get too comfortable and speak too much (and come across as annoying and maybe like the socially awkward kid who never had many friends in high school and is way too excited, which is accurate, and am not invited back). I've always wished I could die easily, like before waking up, but I think I'm too scared to actually kill myself. I'm trying to think of more reasons to want to continue living that don't have to do with friends or significant others, because I honestly don't see much of that in my future because honestly, I wouldn't want to be friends with me either! Yes I have family that loves me but it's just not the same. And yes I have pets but they kind of suck. I can barely take care of myself and it's a lot of work to take care of them too and it's draining since they are not affectionate pets (birds and a snake). I used to be excited about my career (veterinarian) but now it seems daunting and like too much work that I'm not cut out for. What are some other things that are worth living for?",
386,"female, 24, hope to die A brief overview: I'm a 24 year old recluse, poor, in debt from student loans with no degree to show for it, job prospects are dismal, disgraced by the fact I still live at home, have social anxiety accompanied by chronic blushing, and am friendless. I am quite unemotional as I type this. I can not abate the conviction that I am NOTHING. It has been with me my whole life and it is immutable. I have nothing to offer, nothing to capitalize on, and thoughts of suicide occur daily. I honestly do not wish to live. I am also prematurely agonizing over aging; I can not remove from my mind the impression that a woman's worth is determined by her sexual value. Also, I suffer intensely because my split bisexual brain makes me feel the need to live up to the expectations of manhood and womanhood so my sense of failure is doubled. I don't trust that I can even coherently summarize or address all the things that are mutilating me and give an adequate impression of the state of mind I'm in. I'm not even a reliable authority on myself. I pray an accident claims my life and relieves me of the inevitable burden. Thank you for reading",

389,"suicidal again There are many things I'm just plain tired of. The constant yelling and fighting between my 12 yr old and my wife is what makes me want to do it. The more I have to listen to it the more I get closer to actually finishing what I want to do. I figure they can have the life insurance and they can't fight all they friggin want to and I won't have to hear it anymore. There are many things I've come to terms with. Suicide is the ultimate sin that you can't ask forgiveness for. Eternal hell. I'm ok with that. It doesn't bother me so much like it has in the past. Last time the urge got so bad I actually did get help. They wanted me to check in to some inpatient facility but I told them I wasn't about to be strapped to some bed all day long. So they put me on an anti-psychotic. Well a lot of good that does. My body metabolizes medications so fast and I have to take it at night because it makes me sleepy that I don't think there's any of it in my system by morning. Things that will knock most people on their butt I have to take a large amount of to work. But that's not the way I want to go. There is a risk of rescue that I think isn't worthwhile. I'm not ""reaching out for help"" because I believe one of these nights the yelling and fighting will push me too far and the overwhelming urge to remove myself will be more than I can stand. It's a daily thing and in all honesty I can't believe it hasn't happened yet. One time the therapist asked why I don't just leave and move out. I don't know how many of you work crappy government jobs and make next to nothing but seriously...where would I go. Move out only to be alone? I can do that now by removing myself. For now the urge has subsided because the yelling and the fighting have stopped. But it will be back tomorrow. It always is. I wish I could say I was able to fight it but it really does get stronger every day. I can picture it and it just doesn't bother me. And really...maybe it will be the ultimate revenge. I've been tortured for so long by this nonsense maybe it's time to let someone else be tortured for once. Because frankly I'm too old and tired to put up with this nonsense every single day. The funny part is I even asked my wife to go to the therapist to learn techniques for dealing with our oldest who has ADHD and she just can't seem to be bothered. I guess she's happy with all the carrying on. But I'm certainly not.",

I have no people in my life to call when I panic and get the feeling that I can not wait any longer to plan and execute my death. I am not going to kill myself today, but when I get in this panic feeling I need an outlet to stop it. I have already bought some of the things I need to kill my self after reading several books. I cannot keep using the standard tricks of a hobby or a walk or to go to a movie to stop this feeling. My reading, crochet or TV just stops working after so much of it all the time. I have looked online several times, but maybe someone else knows something I cannot find there. Is there a chat room that you can talk back and forth like a forum but it works faster? I want to live, but I know I am on the road to suicide. I have found ways to postpone it because I take one day or one hour at a time. The need to end it keeps coming more often during the day so that I am running out of ideas to stop it. I cannot rely on drugs or alcohol of course. I only take a pill as a last resort like right now. I need to talk to someone, NOT on a hotline. I don't want to kill myself, I am a coward. But I know it is coming and knowing that makes every minute worse and worse so I cannot bear it. I want to die to stop this pain. I need to break the cycle of course. I buy a new book or clean my apartment to distract myself. Than only works for so many times and I run out of ideas. I eat ice cream constantly to sooth myself and distract myself from the suicide plan. It makes me feel worse. I have gained ten pounds in the last two months and this is causing me more panic and depression to the breaking point. I am also waiting for my cat to die before I can kill myself because it would be cruel for her to be put in a shelter or get adopted. She has terminal kidney failure, but since she is not in pain I cannot make myself put her down yet. I have only two friends left in the world, but they have moved out of town and I cannot talk to them about my depression anymore. They are a couple, one of which is a suicide survivor and it is rude and wrong to tell them how much I want to kill myself. I am not a criminal or homeless. I am a retired single person with a pension and enough to pay my rent. I am mostly agoraphobic so I don't need much. I won't re-consider mental help because I have not had any success with psychiatry or anti-depressants. I am not religious so do not ask me to pray for help. I just need human contact other than books or TV. Does any one else feel like this? I am 60, I have been this way for over 10 years and depressed for most of my life since 15 years old.",
393,"I'll Try This Again For my entire life, I've never seen purpose or meaning in this existence. I've been unable to motivate myself to pursue any pathway in life as I put no value in the things other people value. As much as I've tried to involve myself in the activities other people seem to enjoy so much, it gives me no pleasure and no respite. I, furthermore, have no interest in other human beings whatsoever, hard as I've tried to change this in my foolish, naive belief that it would make my life more tolerable. I have no one in my life that cares about me (and I mean that quite literally - I live in total isolation from other people and have done for approx two years), and I do not care about anyone else. Every relationship/friendship I have been involved in has ended in immense pain as a result of my inability to value anything until it is gone. I've had one person in my life time that I would consider a real friend, but she cut me out as everyone else has done. I do not blame her - I am not a good or nice person. On the contrary, I am everything that most human beings despise - I don't buy the life-affirming bullshit that is forced down our throats from day one, I don't force myself to appear happier for the sake of some social veneer (though I certainly used to), I freely talk about my ""negative"" (generally a BS word used by self-decieving morons to describe those who don't view life as peachy) views on the world. In other words, I'm the worst nightmare of the ""you have so much to live for!"" crowd. I'm well aware that I have talents and gifts, things I'm sure others would call ""reasons to live"". I am not ugly. I am intelligent. I'm a very talented singer. A very good overall musician. I've been told many times that I'm very charming by people who haven't yet gotten to know my dark side. But yet, I cannot shake this feeling of utter pointlessness and emptiness hanging over me. It's as inescapable as my own shadow, and it has been here since I was a child. Other people have had their lives, their good days and their bad days, all of their memories and their experiences that they value so much, and yet I've only had this blackness. Hopefully, I won't have to live with it for much longer. There is nothing more I wish to experience now.",

When I was only trying to say ""once you guys stop making ridiculous claims I'll stop talking"" my mom started lalalallaaing me and I tried to only put her hand over my mouth and my dad spun right around and took me to the hospital, in the emergency lane. THey kept threatening me and I have said numerous times that I would kill myself. But I won't really. But I feel like it, but there is only one reason why I won't do it. After some serious begging they gave me one chance to stop freaking out, and I took it. But when they kept yelling at me to stop talking and aggravating me more when I just wanted to say one more thing, they spun back again when I just said to take their own advice. But they didn't go to the hospital still, I begged some more, They spun around again and took me home, and at last they stopped talking and none of us said a word till we got to the house. Then my idiot dad gets out of the truck, tells me to ""come here"", opens the door, corners me in the house, and grabs me by the throat when all I did to my mom is try to put my hand over her mouth. What an idiot. I am so done with my family and the world being against me. I can see the world not revolving around me, but every second it seems like the world is against me, and I can't take this no more. I would swear but I'm afraid I'd prob get banned from here so I wont. Him and Mom left to get something to eat. I sat in silence for around 10 minutes until I threw some shoes, and my brother came out and said ""Stop right now or I'm calling the hospital"". All they heard is Dad's screwed side of the story so he doesn't understand, yet he seems to not care about me either. And neither do my Dad or Mom. I swear if they do this anymore I will run away and I am seriously contemplating it tonight. They keep saying holidays are done and over and that they won't talk to me or anything and that I will go to the hospital yet none of these things never happen. They're usually fine until I have a big blowup, then it seems everything comes crashing down for them again, and when I'm fine and I say I'll be fine they still get mad at me for no reason. And when I do stop talking then they keep saying what an idiot I am (to put it lightly) and that everything's done and over, and they expect me to keep quiet? Idiots. I won't admit I'm perfect but neither are they. I can tell my mom can't handle this as well. She has 3 relatives with serious health conditions besides me, and around when I blow up she frequently says it's the end, everything's coming down, and she can't take it no more. And I really don't want her to feel this way when it is not my fault. All of this stopped around 20 minutes ago now, I came right downstairs to type this on my computer. I feel so done with the world and it's stupidity. Someome please help cause I don't got much more left. Just when I think it's getting better, the worse thing pops up and all h... breaks loose. And Im scared bc they said they can call the hospital and they might get mad and call em anyway when Im not there. Even tho Im fine now. They overreact to something I did. This is so stupid and I am done. Someone please help because this got really out of hand today... my first big blowup in a two weeks Note: We went and seen someone that deals with this kind of things two weeks ago or so. It was on a Sunday so prob two and a half by now. But it was scheduled so it didn't come as a result of me freaking out dicrectly, so I have already had a bit of help already, but again for those of you whove read my other post its not that I don't want bad things to not become bad, its that I want to deal with it better and not freak out. And I freak out more around my parents because they know. In public I wouldn't do it becasuse no one knows and Id get self concious. My mind blows this up and bugs me about these things which only aggravates it more. I've had enough aggravation now. Of someone would calmly deal with it I wouldn't ever be upset, but noooo my parents have to be idiots and torture me along with my mind. But they don't do it all the time. My mind does though and I want it gone. Please someone help because I am afraid this cannot go any longer and if it does I might actually not go on holidays. Idk how parents feel right now they're gone to eat. But I hope all is fine. But I know it's not because I've had less big blowups and my mom in particular was affected for more than a day. This was the worst yet and I was soooooooooooooo close to getting to the hospital. I don't want or need that. I just need someone to tell some things. Plz make this go away and end",

409,"Please Save Me Guys, I really don't know how to start this, but I've been having suicidal thoughts for some time now. The truth is, I really don't want to die, but I don't want to live either. I'm 22. I've been back at home with my dad and step-mother for almost a year now, and I can't handle it. I've always struggled with depression, but I can't handle this environment. I have a job, but I don't make enough money to support myself. I lived alone for four years, I went through poverty and many nights I didn't know where my next meal would come from. I was depressed throughout that, but I didn't want to die. And now I'm back at home with my alcoholic father and control freak hateful step-mother, and I just want to take my shotgun, stick it in my mouth, and pull the trigger in front of them. I want my step-mother to know that her hatefulness killed me. I want her to feel the pain that she's caused me. When I first moved back here, I had some fight left in me. When she acted out and tried to stress me out, I bit back. Now I just put my tail between my legs and take her yelling. Lately, it's ramped up my heartrate and I just can't think. She can't read my body language, and she mistakes my fear for anger, and she yells at me even more. I just can't fight back. She is a control freak and she's addicted to stress. I can't take that. I'm not angry, I just can't handle it. I just want to die at that moment. I just want to put a shotgun in my mouth and blow my brains out. This happened again last night, and I tried to explain that I can't take her talking to me that way, and she lashed out at me even more. She thinks she can do no wrong. I just wanted to die. One day later, I still want to die. I've thought of nothing else but killing myself all day. I just hate the fact that she has this anger. For the past year, my gut has been twisted because I never know what kind of mood she's going to be in, and I'd rather die than be around that. When I'm alone, away from here, I don't feel that. I just want to be alone. I want to live by myself, and no one can dictate my mood but me. I can't fucking take how she acts, and I just want to fucking die. Every time I talk to her about this, she makes me feel lower than dirt. She talks to me like a child, and I fucking hate that. I grew up in an abusive home, and I can't take her anger. How can I deal with this? How can I get through this without killing myself? I don't want to die, but I don't want to live with her, and I don't have a way out. I'm too depressed to look for a different job, and I just want a way out. I just try to get through each mood she's in, and I'm running out of steam. I just can't fucking take the way she acts. I'm more afraid of her than anyone else on this planet. I want to stand my ground like I used to, but I don't have it in me. My heart starts beating really fast and I feel like I'm about to have a heart attack, and she thinks I'm mad. I can't fucking take this. Please, guys. Please tell me a way out.",

411,"Suicide because Hair Loss I have been suicidal for almost 5 years now and it is due to hair loss. Having a full head of hair is absolutely integral to my ability to feel handsome and comfortable in my own skin, and to my enjoyment of life. I noticed my hair loss very late so no amount of preventative medication or any other type of current treatment can really help me out at this point. Not to mention, I was on anti-depressants for a number of years, which I believe triggered the premature onset of my hair loss, a fact that I didn't even know until it was too late. I have also experienced terrible side effects from finasteride, which is the most common medication to prevent hair loss today. And I am not about to wear a wig. Life is just not worth living anymore and I always wish I would just fall asleep and never wake up. I cry out to God to relieve my pain and He does absolutely nothing. I don't know where else to turn or what else to do. Life is just hopeless.",
412,"Really, really down This pain is never going to leave me and it has crippled my life completely and I am just tired of it. It's just one misery after the next and everyone that I like ends up not liking me once they get to know me. It's just the annoying people that I hate tend to like me and I suppose I must be one of them to the people I like. This is maybe the way for many people. There is no answer. Life just does not work or only works for some but not others. I am self-centred, egotistical and unkind and I hate my life and myself. I hate how boring I am. I hate how few friends I have. I hate how I feel about myself. I hate having to be hated. And I hate God for creating this shitty existence that is a journey from one misery to the next with carrots to lead you along the way.

I don't have any close friends, I just have acquantainces that only like you when you're up there. If I had any special talents, in music or sports, I could balance my failure to a certain point but I must be the most unskilled person in the world. Besides, hobbies won't generate income and with shadow of unemployment always around, it doesn't make any sense to invest in things that won't pay the bills at the end of the month. I didn't have a choice when it came to being born, but I certainly can choose when I want to die. And that is now. My parents will get over it quickly, my elder brother is highly successful and I'm just the spare anyway, I'm 'that ungrateful spoiled boy who was only born because people are supposed to have at least 2 children.'

At the moment, I am trying to sell my road bike so that I can fly out of the United States and try to live in New Zealand. I go to sleep and wake up everyday thinking about suicide. Only this time, it is more serious but not as serious as it was in my high school years were. I am in my sixth year of college, still an undergraduate and still have not earned my degree. I just changed my major for the fourth time in my collegiate career. This time, I feel like I am over my head and I don't know what to do. I cannot join the Army/Navy/Marines or any other military branch because I am hard of hearing (been wearing hearing aids since birth). People who are hard of hearing or deaf, only 50% of them graduate from college and few get good paying jobs. So my options of doing ANYTHING at all is very minimal. Heck my collegiate career on paper is going to look good for prospective companies looking to hire. I am sorry if my above paragraph is jumbled. I can also add that with this depression I have been having lately, I have been having much trouble sleeping. Even when I do get good sleep, I still feel in over my head (as I have said before...kind of like a mantra). I just don't know what to do anymore....:( All I just know is that this is my last semester that my parents are helping me for school. After that I am all on my own.

418,"I need relief. Hi everyone, this is my first post. Bear with me. I have a self-esteem problem, and I'm constantly beating myself up emotionally if I feel I've done wrong. I shared a rather unhealthy relationship with someone who I stupidly considered my best friend. I ended up being sexually assaulted by the same guy in the winter of 2012. We admitted we both had feelings for each other, and he began putting pressure on me to have sex with him. Once or twice we sext, because if I'm honest it felt good for someone to want me like he did. Things with my boyfriend fell apart quickly after this. I told him I did what I did to get my 'friend' to leave me alone. To sum up of a lot of complicated emotions, I feel like I was asking for it. I gave my 'friend' all the signals, and I stupidly walked right into it. Even though I had an idea of what he was capable of. I've been to counselling after a psychologist I saw at my local hospital suggested I may be suffering from depression. The more I think about what happened, the more I think about how I practically used my boyfriend as a crutch after I became disillusioned with my 'friend', the more I know I'm human garbage. I feel like a dog who should be put down for the good of everyone else. I'm manipulative, I don't care about anyone else's feelings. Everytime I begin to feel just a shred of relief or happiness I begin to mentally torture myself and make myself feel guilty again. What if I'm a psychopath? What if I really hurt someone?

I'm at the point where even if I did have the motivation, there are so many other things preventing me from being 'normal'. I can't relate to others... I get really anxious around people in general. I'd still be fucked if my depression was gone tomorrow. So why waste anymore time? I can't remember the last time I was happy. I really don't. I really should be dead. Therapy?

426,"The real suicide case. Dying inside already. Well, here I am on a venting forum. Reason somewhat being is because I don't think anyone would give a rodent's arse if I blogged how I feel about my situation. That being said, I'll probably seem like a poor sap pleading for validation in talents or positivity I'm not sure I even have, nor believe exists within myself. So for my situation, as pathetically and plainly I can put it, I eat my soul out and tear a little more with each keystroke. I'm a 20 year old skinny, physically insignificant male. (Let's face it, my workouts are practically nonexistent thanks to chronic stomach pains and lack of sleep) I live in a small town of Hayward, CA (for the geographically inclined, in the middle of Oakland and San Jose, as vast a distance that may be). I'm diagnosed with social anxiety which has been nothing but passive torture for 5 years straight). Moving schools twice (yeah, not a lot, but for someone with anxiety...), I never had a chance to get close to anyone in high school. And when I came back, it's not like anyone would be interested in a little boy face sophomore, especially when the social circles are pretty much fixed (especially in high school). And not having any friends from middle school didn't help, as I was the kid people knew was naive and immature, for pure loner material. So that quality probably carried into freshman year of high school, as street-smarts were very much a thing between the testosterone and estrogen packed youth, aside from myself of course. I played the same role each P.E. class in high school. Not doing so hot in my local private high school, my primal Asian parents decided it was a disciplinary matter, and sent me to a military school. Yipee for me. But ironically, it WAS a yipee for me. I ended up liking the roommate, dorm, independent life. And to be honest, it was nearly a turn for the better, as I actually developed social capabilities, if not street-smarts. I even turned out to be the only cadet who actually conversed (flirt) with our cute Latina game room receptionist. I made foreign friends and things seemed to be heading in the right direction for once... But of course, all good things must come to an end. And this quote could not be more relevant in my life, as my beyond poor academic performance were what suspended me from this haven, in the first semester, no less, ending my hopes and dreams of an actual future. Without any choice but to return home (appeal letter failed miserably), the local public school was my only chance of an education. There I entered, alone amongst aforementioned social circles most likely relieved not to have some little wandering kid within their friendships. Fast forwarding, orientation of college was my one and only chance of making a name for myself (not in a big way, just to make some friends period). We entered the dorm we'd be staying in for the night, I felt pretty chatty amongst my roommates...And of course, anxiety kicked in and practically stapled me into introversion when (figures) 2 cute girls entered our dorm room (orientation was a 2 night thing). Surprisingly, my seemingly competent and keeping his cool roommate didn't seem to do much better. Although the 2 females were obviously more interested in him. So he didn't even have to start a conversation to get them horny. But in the end, my opportunities to get to know people in college was passed by against my will, leaving me stranded and alone starting off in the college world. Yep, I missed the chance to get to know 3 people when I just got here. So here I am, alone and unable to get close to anyone in college, let alone find someone to talk to. Already in my second year, meeting people is pretty much not an option if I want a circle of my own. I have no special networks, sports, nor anything that will get people interested in me in the slightest. With each passing day, people are meeting people meeting people, which is my definition of networking at its finest, something I'm far from capable of doing without a group of socialites of my own. This is a perfect example of why loners stay loners for God knows how long. I don't even have family to talk to. My mom's side is in Korea, and my dad is probably one of the most isolated and unpleasant middle aged person you'll ever lay eyes on. Yeah, you can judge him from a glance, even. His side of the family nearly ostracizes us, as we hardly ever attend family gatherings, spend time with them, or hell, even have dinner with them. Of course, they're all close and comfortable with each other, but we're like nobodies, the way I take it. They say family are greater than friends, but I don't even have that. I live a loser life with a (hopefully) winner mindset. I simply come home from class, finish homework, and play games. I'll admit it now, there's no parties or any type of social event that will welcome me in any manner. Sundays, I chill with at least ONE close friend (thank God, he exists) who's kind of in a similar situation, but at least has friends from our elementary school, who I'm not too big a fan of. I don't drive as we're ""too poor"" to afford any type of vehicle since my mom quit her job (thanks a lot, anxiety). So I'm mommy's little passenger and a loner easily overlooked. Honestly, if anyone were to have a reason to commit suicide, I think it would be me alone, as I can promise you readers that no one is in a similar, nor worse situation I'm in. Why? you probably have a friend. Even 1 friend is more than I can say for myself. All you suicidals out there, I don't care how bad your health, life, or relationship is. I promise you have a reason to live because you have people in your life. If I were dead, there wouldn't be anyone who'd notice or miss me. Welcome to me. Enjoy your stay. Pure loneliness. P.S. I almost lost this post since I took so long to write this. Lol, as if I don't deserve to share my feelings.",
427,"Something you can do for yourself when you are feeling bad Here is something you can do for yourself when you are feeling bad and there is no one to talk to. The more you do it the more you will get answers and a sense of peace. I try to do it at least once a day. If you have any questions PM me... I am here for all of you. Angel Your Higher Self, in Writing If you have gut instincts, you have this ability. This ability IS your gut instincts in writing. It carries profound accuracy, and is available to you every moment. That ""still small voice"" within, that ""gut feeling"" or sudden brilliant idea, is the source of your highest wisdom communicating to you to help you in your life. Many people have different names for the source of their highest wisdom. This is fine. You can call the source of this wisdom God, intuition, your higher self, common sense, higher consciousness, your deepest wisdom, the collective unconscious, divine source, all that is, supra- consciousness, as well as any other name you give to higher wisdom in its purest form. Your Divine innate wisdom in writing can suffice as far as naming this ability. The most important aspect of this is that you access your highest wisdom to achieve, clarify, or gain a higher perspective, to help you in any area of your life. If you have any questions, please log on to the IHSC Higher Self Communication Yahoo Group, and your questions regarding receiving answers from God, Your Highr Self will be answered. Here are the simple steps to receive advance information from God, your Higher Self, in writing. Have a deep heartfelt desire to receive an answer, guidance, clarification, a higher perspective regarding anything that is weighing on your heart and mind. Write, ""Dear God, ... and from that point simply write your question (s) from your heart. Take seven deep breaths so the air goes deep into your belly. Exhale from your mouth. Ask to be consciously connected to God or whatever name you give your highest and deepest source of guidance or wisdom. Ask for only the pure truth, to come to your mind in writing. (You can pray for divine protection if you believe in this, or you can simply say in your own mind that you request ONLY the highest and purest truth. If you believe in prayer, you can read psalm 121 from the bible before you begin. Or you can simply tell yourself that you are now going to access and bring your highest wisdom forth into your conscious mind.) Write your questions down. Then write Thank You for this wisdom in advance. (Personally, I write: ""Thank You God for Divine, Perfect Truth in Advance. Love, Barbara."") You may phrase your thank you in any way you prefer. Just know that you are about to receive wisdom, and an attitude of gratitude is best for this. As words and thoughts come into your mind, start writing. Do NOT censor, or try to make any sense of the words as they come into your mind. You can analyze all you want when you are finished. Just write every word as fast as you can. Abbreviate words. For example: Rather than write the word ""with"" I write ""w/."" No matter what words come into your mind, write them down. (You may not believe a lot of the words that come to mind, (I used to think ""this is bull"" or ""No way!"" or ""I don't believe this"" when I received information in writing. And yet, they ALL turned out to be the truth!) After you receive the answers to your questions in writing, go back and read all of your information. Save your writings! I cannot stress this enough. In the future, you will look back, and see how the guidance or answers you were given was astoundingly accurate. That is all there is to it!",

When I try to explain the depression, it sounds like whining to them and maybe it is, but I can't seem to bring myself out of it and do what everyone else does. It's very hard to look in the mirror. This is something I've battled with for years, sometimes being functional and other times not... but underneath it is deep self-loathing and a feeling of worthlessness.

437,"My sister saw my marks of self-harm. What do I do now? I've been self-harming a little lately, I'm not sure when I'll be able to stop, but my older sister saw, and her friend today. I hurt myself a lot this Wednesday. She asked me to show her, (She pressed me very hard for that information) and I refused. She repeated it over and over and I told her I was 'disassembling my laptop and it had sharp parts' but she denied it immediately. Without even telling me anything first, she told my mother and I overheard her. I already didn't want my family to know, and the only time I got close to committing suicide was when they know. My mother is the person I least want to know this. She only suggests that I have social problems and never says anything else, she has no respect for me after I admitted a small portion of this. One student saw my marks, he thought it was hilarious. Somebody else saw them, obviously, but they never even mentioned it, and the only people I actually would want to mention it probably don't care. Another did, I was able to avert it. I feel like killing myself, possibly soon, but I'm not sure. What should I say...?",
438,"Empathy and Inspiration lacking I don't have a lot of it, and it's confusing. I want to be a good person but I'm mostly a self-serving... child. I'm almost like a child. A lot of the time it's like I only show consideration for other people (opening doors, dropping change) when it doesn't come as a major inconvenience to me. At work we have a fundraising effort that everyone pitches in because my boss has ""sponsored"" two children. It only costs me 75 cents a month and I would look like a dick for not contributing, so I do. Do I particularly care that I'm helping? Not really. I have a lot of disdain for a lot of people. I am incredibly awkward around children. I never was good at smiling without a reason, and it's difficult to appear benevolent and friendly to them without smiling. And I'm not a good talker. It creates guilt around the Christmas season... I mean, Christmas is not a thing that I believe in anymore. I might have liked it as a child, but what child doesn't like getting presents? I don't like receiving gifts anymore. They remind me of how difficult it is for me to buy for other people. I don't feel that joy of giving either; I never did, so I don't understand someone getting joy from giving ME something. All I can think of is what a waste it is for them. It's not like I emote when I open a present. It's not like I get a smile on my face, though when I was younger I tried to fake it more because I always saw other people doing it. So Christmas is a gathering of family members I feel mostly nothing for, talking amongst each other while I fail to be sociable, not that I ever succeeded. It's just that as a kid I could get away with it because I was ""shy"". These days it's just pathetic. I don't know if anyone's noticed how lazy my writing has gotten. I completely miss obvious typos even when I proofread. I use words that don't make sense in the sentence. My sentence structure is lazy. Hence all the random ellipses, which I just delete instead of rewriting the sentence to get the pacing that I wanted to affect USING the ellipses. I copy myself a lot, with repeated redundant phrases that have appeared in my oral communication... and there's this new thing—when I stutter now, it's a lot worse. Don't know where that's coming from. So yeah. There you go. There are things that have always been wrong with me, things that have been wrong with me since depression, and new things keep popping up. I don't know how to fix me and I don't want to be like this forever but I have no idea how to break a lot of cycles I go through and I don't know if I'll ever be wanted and I've grown into this ugly person, with my appearance reflecting my personality pretty well I imagine. I've been thinking some pretty bad thoughts lately in response to it all. Going to therapy and paying for hours and hours of it seems like such an unfair necessity when I can't even TRUST someone just because they have a job in the field. The only people that would care about me being gone have exhausted my personal interest in them. The people I'd WANT to care elude me because I don't know how to BE caring towards THEM. I know what you're thinking. ""OH IT MUST BE SO SAD HAVING PEOPLE CARE ABOUT YOU."" Yeah, I only wish I could reciprocate. I don't FEEL any love a lot of the time. I just feel alone.",

If they can send pictures, it leaves me to believe that he's definitely done other things with her, whether it's kissing or sex.

443,"Before you kill yourself You've decided to do it. Life is impossible. Suicide is your way out. Fine -- but before you kill yourself, there are things you should know. I am a psychiatric nurse, and I see the results of suicide -- when it works and, more often, when it doesn't. Consider, before you act, these facts: Suicide is usually not successful. You think you know ways to guarantee it? Ask the 25-year-old who tried to electrocute himself. He lived. But both his arms are gone. What about jumping? Ask John. He used to be intelligent with an engaging sense of humor. That was before he leaped from a building. Now he's brain-damaged and will always need care. He staggers and has seizures. He lives in a fog. Worst of all, he knows he used to be normal. What about pills? Ask the 12-year-old with extensive liver damage from an overdose. Have you ever seen anyone die of liver damage? You turn yellow. It's a hard way to go. What about a gun? Ask the 24-year-old who shot himself in the head. Now he drags one leg, has a useless arm and has no vision or hearing on one side. He lived through his ""foolproof"" suicide. You might too. Who will clean your blood off the carpet or scrape your brains from the ceiling? Commercial cleaning crews may refuse that job -- but someone has to do it. Who will have to cut you down from where you hanged yourself or identify your bloated body after you've drowned? Your mother? Your wife? Your son? The carefully worded ""loving"" suicide note is no help. Those who loved you will never completely recover. They'll feel regret and an unending pain. Suicide is contagious. Look around at your family. Look closely at that 4-year-old playing with his cars on the rug. Kill yourself tonight and he may do it 10 years from now. You do have other choices. There are people who can help you through this crisis. Call a hotline. Call a friend. Call your minister or priest. Call a doctor or the hospital. Call the police. They will tell you that there's hope. Maybe you'll find it in the mail tomorrow. Or in a phone call this weekend. But what you're seeking could be just a minute, a day or a month away. You say you still don't want to be stopped? Still want to do it? Then I may see you in a psychiatric ward later. And we'll work with whatever you have left. Written by: Renee T. Lucero; Reader's Digest June 1985",
444,"Does life really get better? Hello, I haven't been here for a very long time. I'm sorry that I have not been here to support others during my periods of recovery, and I did not turn to you during my relapses either. I just disappeared. I have a plan to kill myself, I have not set a date - although yesterday evening I thought it would be a good idea to do it today. I felt differently when I woke up, I have not got all of the elements together in order for my suicide to be a success, and the thought of leaving the house to obtain these things was more than I could bear. Added to that, in a desperate moment of optimism last week I arranged for a friend to come over tonight for pizza and movies. I will try my best to be sociable and I may have to drink for that to work. I have this sense of obligation, like I can't break an agreement - not even to do the one thing I am just itching to do, the one thing I can't stop thinking about. I have become obsessed. I told my best friend but she is not in a good place herself and confessed she had decided to end her life... tomorrow. I am not strong enough to deal with it but I will do my best to get her the support she needs. I think hearing that she has her plan too made my mind go into overdrive last night and that is why I was convinced that today was going to be the day. But obviously I cannot make that decision so abruptly. These things take time and planning and you have to be absolutely sure that it is the only option. Anyway, I thought I would use this space to try to unravel the mess in my head - to get to the root of why I think suicide is the best option and to see if I can see a different side to it all. Obviously I know there are the usual responses but I can't appreciate somebody else's reasons to live -I want to have my own reasons to live. I really do want to have reasons to live, because then I would have some sense of satisfaction that I am doing what feels good for all the right reasons. Whereas currently putting in the effort to remain alive seems so counter-intuitive because life is just causing me so much pain and grief. The pain and grief is not exactly circumstantial though, it is coming FROM me in the first place - all of the reasons my life sucks are pretty much my fault. The things that cause me problems are so deeply ingrained into my character and I don't have the skills to change, nor the access to services and people who could support me in doing that. Regardless of intention I have been consitently sabotaging my own chances of success or happiness throughout my life. I do not believe I can be trusted to function... Unless I can fall submissive to somebody who is going to run my life with my best interests in mind and give me the delicate balance of freedom, structure and stimulation I require to function. But I am 24 and this is reality and in reality I will NOT find a magical adoptive family who is willing to be patient with me and correct all the mistakes of the past. I am an awful person, I have allowed others to form bonds with me and to become attached when I was never sure I would be able to remain in a position to maintain those relationships. I just befriended those people who I needed in my life and did not think about their position in the wider picture and how my presence in their life could cause potential problems. I even still hang onto my relationship with my father, albeit by a thread. I spend most of my time ignoring my thoughts of him, but when it comes to the times of year where it is compulsory that one sees their family members, we visit one another and he buys me gifts and I like gifts. I do not like my father very much though, I think he is a strange man from whom I have inherited far too many neuroses - he projected too many complicated ideas onto me before I was old enough to truly understand. Ultimately I was left feeling inadequate in a many ways - as does he I am sure, but this is not something we should be teaching our children. From my father I have inherited these things: a short fuse, an inability to handle money sensibly, a compulsion to behave above my socioeconomic standing, a grudge against being poor, a problem with authority, always needing to be the best (never being good enough), seriously exaggerating any achievements when in the company of superiors, my contempt for others, crippling fear of failure. I suppose if we're going to go down the freudian route of parents fucking us up then I'd better consider my mother as well, since she is the most present family member in my life. I have conflicted feelings when I address my mother's position in my life - I understand that the way I am is partly BECAUSE of her, but it very hard to say that and not feel like I am blaming her for everything that is wrong with my life. I don't want to blame my mother, I do sometimes, for certain things, but I feel so incredibly guilty for blaming her. Well, on my mother's side I have inherited quite a few problems as well, let's start with a big one and go from there: CONTROL ISSUES, body image issues, fear of being alone, obsessive list-making, irrational malicious outbursts, anxiety in many forms, unruly eyebrows (ho-ho!) SO there's the stuff they projected onto me, now what about the stuff I learned through experience, at home and at school. I learned that no matter whether you do what you are asked or not something will always upset my mother, I will always upset my mother. My father taught me that I was ugly, to the point that taking a photograph of me was frustrating. Kids at school confirmed this was the case. Both of my parents taught me that on the whole accidents are just as bad as deliberate wrongdoing, everything I do is wrong because I always get it wrong. School taught me that being proud of your achievements is wrong and you can always do better, I am never good enough. My mother taught me to only show her my drawings when I wanted to know what needed to change - otherwise I would get criticism for something I thought was perfect (psst, you are never good enough) Your name will come up often in fights between your parents, soon it will be the only word you can hear durnig the screaming matches. You are the reason they fight. I love you is something that we do not say to each other. It is awkward. I do not remember these words ever being used. I am... too needy, too slow, not listening, making a mess, getting in the way, asking too many questions, disrupting the class, a smartass, not eating fast enough, not eating properly, too skinny yet too big to sit in anyone's lap, a thumbsucker, a bedwetter, a brat... I can't be trusted, I can't be trusted to do things properly and I can't be trusted not to make a huge mistake. I can't be trusted not to hurt my baby sister, I can't be trusted to do what I'm asked, can't be trusted to remember important things, can't be trusted to tell the truth... can't be trusted. I should stop letting my imagination run away with me, I have ridiculous ideas and unrealistic hopes, I cannot be what/where/who/how I like to imagine I could be. I feel overwhelmed and I haven't even begun to reflect on how these things have a debilitating impact on my life as an adult, coupled with the desperately poor availability of mental health care... my prospects for recovery to the point of leading a fulfilling life is beyond my wildest dreams, it is hysterical. I will post just because I think this alone might be enough for others to offer fresh insight and angles to consider. Next episode - the physical limitations of adult life and how they restrict my potential for recovery.",

446,"My family would think it was great if I died So often I've read here ""I can't commit suicide because it would hurt my parents"" or my family so much. I really can't even imagine that. First of all, I am in the fifties and don't have a family of my own. So there is nobody who would even miss me or think it was there job to bury me. But the only family I do have, my family of origin, hate me and treat me like absolute garbage. Well, not my mom. She is elderly and lives with my sister. My sister went on vacation so my mom is alone. I called my mom and said I would go come down just for the day yesterday to visit her. My niece came over and found out and said I was not allowed under my sister's roof. My sister hates me. No reason given. She smiles in your face, sharpens a knife behind your back. My mom is lonely. I called both my nieces who were dropping in on my mom and neither one would return my phone calls. I called my mom again and said are they going to call the police if I visit you? Then my sister lied and said she never said it, but she did, and she just makes everything worse by lying about lying. A lot of stuff has happened between my sister and I that nobody knows about- she is abusive and manipulative. Anyway nobody knows my side of anythng and they are all afraid to offend her. So I am locked out of everything. And this weekend I could not even visit my mother. I honestly think if I killed myself they would be disgusted and not bother to even bury me. They hate me and don't even talk to me. I never did anything to deserve this. And right now I wish I were dead. I am so depressed I am in physical pain and exhausted. I hate my sister for being so cruel. I would like to never have to deal with her again. I would like my life to be over now. OO",

448,"I spend every waking moment thinking about killing myself At least it seems like it sometimes. Either that or injuring myself. Constantly, often from the moment I wake up. If I go for a walk that's the thing constantly on my mind. Every day I am reminded of or see many things that trigger these thoughts and give me an impulse to injure myself on the spot, especially if I go on the Web/TV/outside. I'm constantly flooded with fantasies of killing myself that repeat over and over. However I'm different I think from other people who are suicidal. It's not something I have an exact plan for or plan on doing right now, it may be a few years before it happens. Maybe I'm not really suicidal, I'm just immaturely fantasizing. I'm sorry about trivializing others who really have problems. I have moral reasons for not doing it, but on the other hand I constantly imagine myself doing it. But the point is my life is going nowhere. I expect to either end up homeless, not now or eventually, or be dead before I get there. I try to explain, but people even here think I'm a retard and idiot and say it's my fault for doing nothing in life. I know I'm mentally ill, but I have a deeper meaning in what I say. Like when I give an example of something that's ""proof"" of why I will die young or can't work, people here laugh at me. OK I know, it's not a proof, I've done enough proofs in mathematics, not that I still remember that stuff. I meant evidence, but needed a stronger word to describe how I feel when I made those posts. When you're calling me a fool, you're not seeing the meaning of what I'm saying. I'm talking about society. For those saying I'm making excuses, well, I used to work. I had several albeit brief jobs and instead of graduating with debt I had a surplus in my bank account (granted, it was mostly because of the system I was in). I got better than average grades and lived independently away from my parents most of that time. Why am I giving up on ever getting a job now? I think I know why and I'm trying to explain it. I think I'm predetermined at birth to die young. To have this destiny. I was born this way and the winds of society (sorry, saw another thread title) have forced me from revealing myself to the outside world.",

I'm almost 25 now, and I still live with suicidal thoughts daily. I often feel inferior to those around me, and like I am the blemish in an otherwise beautiful picture. Given that I no longer believe in an afterlife or in the divinity of religion (for unrelated reasons,) this leaves me with existential questions literally every day. There is nobody in my life (except occasionally my Dr.) that I can ever discuss this with, because most people can't handle such intense topics. But it makes me feel good at 11:30pm after several days of feeling like the most permanently mediocre person on earth, to know that there is a place I can be honest about my sad thoughts, without fear.

457,"Hopeless... Well I guess this is the one word that describes it best. I am an all round hopeless sack of shit..the very thing I never wanted to be and have fought all my life for but the picture is always biggest once it is finished and crystal clear. I can't remember the last day I was last sober..But it's definitely more than at least 7 years. I drink so I forget the wrong and evil I have done to others and I can no longer bear it. Everything changed in me the day when I was young maybe 8 or 9...This kid..he would bug the hell out of me everyday even though I didn't want anything to do with him..Then one day I snapped and I tried to drown him in the public pool..I was just fed up and sick of looking at him. Looking back now I think it's definitely an unforgivable thing to do. Even more so being raised in a deeply religious family where saying the 'F' word was extremely taboo. Years went on, I turned 13 and wanted nothing to do with the religion at all, hung out with all ""the bad kids"", took up smoking, smoking pot and drinking...Nothing of which should be too out of the ordinary for a typical teenager..Moved away from home at 16 and would occasionally drink myself to the point where I'd wake up in the hospital in the middle of getting my stomach pumped cause I had drank myself to the point of poisoning, eventually lead to me dropping out of school and living my life freely as I should have at that age...After that point everything began going south for me...Got into popping extasy, snorting it, loved doing coke and when I couldn't get my hands on those I would start popping anything that I thought I could get high on.. All the meanwhile during that time I met many nice girls that I had dated for extended periods of time..They all would eventually turn their backs against me and would cheat on me just to end the relationship. Only maybe a handful of which would have ended it honestly. Was even engaged to 1 for over a year and she eventually cheated on me too...So I just gave up all together on the dating thing and figured it was just another cause that would never happen for me. When I was about 20 I had eventually sobered up a bit, I had eventually moved in with this chick...long story short she turned up to be a cunt and had accused me of attempting to rape her one night, while i was actually stone cold sober and sleeping..I actually think it's total bullshit even to this day but I have doubt in my mind that somewhere some part of me thinks its true.. Needless to say after the whole incident I ran away 3,000 some odd miles to avoid her and any potential charges that I may have recieved even if the whole incident proved to be false I would have had the book thrown at me probably just to be made an example of. My heavy drinking began around that time..anything at all to forget about that shit..Im now 28..I drink alot..My drinking gets me in alot of trouble..I sometimes have tendencies to be racist when I drink..I recently lost my best friend because of it..Yet the only thing I wanna do is drink..Its the only time I can actually be myself anymore..whatever thats supposed to mean...I'm so damaged now that I don't know how to be me...I drink to forget what i am maybe closer to the truth..to know that im some kind of monster thats waiting to do great harm on some undeserving person.. If I seek medical help Im just going to get hooked on pills again so i figure drinking is the way to deal with it. What human part of me that does still remain figures I should be dead by now anyway..I've only escaped the clutches of death a few times over the years..So why should I stop drinking myself to death..I have chronic asthma from all the years of abuse Ive done to my lungs so it's already a good sign that I'm on my way out. I figure there is no point in living life if it can't be enjoyable...Im so damaged I wouldn't even know how to have a relationship much less worry about her potentially finding out about my past one day and having her change her entire opinion on who i really could be inside..no sense risking it..I know deep down that Im hopeless for having any sort of constructive relationship. Hopelessly lonely and deprived of being able to have the sort of success that everyone else in my past is now having and thriving on.. Only thing that exists in my reality is pain and i just wish it would all end. If I have a friend it becomes only so long until they call me thilth or I have them believe a lie. Being true to myself no longer is an option because I wish the bygones would be bygones but they're always hovering over my head and weighing heavy on me.. I need more to drink...alot more to drink to forget about this shit again! this nightmare of a life it needs to end!",
458,"My Best Friend This probably isn't the right place to post this, and I'm really sorry, but a lot of stuff came out tonight and I'm really worried about my friend and I don't know where to turn. This isn't a hypothetical ""friend"" who's really me, this is someone I've been best friends with since the age of eight, who has a lot of reasons to be very upset right now. Her mother was told she had six months to live about nine years ago, so she's been living in fear of her mother's death a long time, and she loves her to pieces (as most people do). She's also diabetic so she has a lot of stress and trouble to deal with in her own life without the added pressure of a mother with cancer. She started drinking and smoking regularly a couple of years ago, and I mean proper chain smoked and getting completely hammered at any occasion. She's calmed down a bit in the past few months, only smoking a couple of times a week, and still getting hammered when she's out, but not going out as often as she used. Thing is, we were out tonight, not at a pub or club or anything, just at a small quiet place, and she started drinking. A lot. Behind our backs. And she was very loud, so we were getting a little embarrassed to be seen with her, and then she started crying, so we had to take her to the bathroom, and after a while of crying and spilling things and just being in overall hysterics, she told us that her dad had been diagnosed with lung cancer. So she really has a lot to deal with, and she confessed to me after we left, still in her messy drunken state, that she didn't want to go home because her mam would see that she'd been crying and the last time she attempted suicide she'd been put under 24-hour surveilance. It threw me a bit because I hadn't known she had been suicidal before. I'd suspected it, but it had been at a time when we weren't as friendly as we are now. She even told me the reason she smokes and drinks so much is because she wants to die as soon as possible, and she doesn't care about her life anymore. Anyway, I'm terrified that she'll try something, and I really don't know what to do, I've never dealt with this before. And it's not like she doesn't have a completely valid reason for it, we can't just tell her everything will be alright when we all know the odds are it wont be. She's supposed to be going out to a birthday party tomorrow, but I'm going to try to convince her to watch a movie or something instead, and I took her lighter tonight so she wont be smoking, but I'm really afraid to leave her alone too long, while at the same time I know she's the kind of person who gets worse when she's surrounded by people. On top of this, most of her drinking, smoking, etc, was while she was still underage, so going to the authorities could just get her in more trouble, she's an overly dramatic person, who wants to study psychology, so there's no way she'd talk to a therapist, and if any of us tried to tell professionals about this she'd probably use that as proof that we don't love her, as even earlier today she insisted we didn't, and that could be what drives her. I really honestly don't know what to do, I just want to help her and don't know how anymore. Please, if anyone can help or give me any sort of advice, it would mean so much to me",
459,"It just seems logical First off, let me just say that I'm not making any plans. I don't plan to harm myself now or in the near future. I don't feel down, desperate or helpless. I know I have people in my life that care about me and people that love me. I think that life has no inherent meaning. We need to find purpose in our lives. We need to find something to be passionate about, something to give our life meaning, something to give us a reason to persevere through the tough times. In my opinion, life without this special something is hollow, pointless, not worth living. I've never really been passionate about anything. I've never felt like I've had any direction in my life. I've never had a raison d'etre. Life seems pretty empty right now. That doesn't mean I'm miserable 24/7 just that it takes a lot of effort to try to keep positive.

I don't wanna get out of this bed and I don't wanna meet anyone, I wanna lay here and rot away. And even if I do find some glimpse of joy I can't hold on to it more than a half-hour or so. So why should I continue? Why should I fight to survive the everyday life? I can't hold myself together and I don't have the energy to go on. I'm already screwing up the few things in my life that are allright, why should I continue? All this life ever got me is HURT and PAIN. I'm sick of it all.",

463,"I don't know what to do Hi everyone, I didn't know where else to go so I decided to join this forum a couple of days ago. I'm quite distraught right now and wanting someone to talk to who can listen. I've been suffering with depression for over a year now. I went through middle school being bullied for three years so that is what triggered it I think. When I reached freshman year, that is when I reached an all the time low. I stopped going to school because I didn't want to have to look forward to the bullying each day, so, I started skipping. My parents decided to put me in online school after that as they thought it would be good. I tried it and it wasn't successful at all. I got no help in the subjects I needed such as math, so, I ended up failing the 10th grade as a result in slacking off work that I did not understand no matter how I tried to. I dropped out after I had failed the 10th grade, but I am studying for the GED. I have no social life whatsoever at the moment and I've become more and more depressed. I feel so worthless and like a failure. I lay in bed all day and instead of binging like a person with depression usually does, I'm the complete opposite. I won't eat and that has caused me to lose a lot of weight. My depression and suicidal thoughts led me to harming myself Monday night. My parents sent me to the hospital when they saw my cuts and I feel like I want to do it again. I'm having the urge to cut again and I've been plotting other ways on how to kill myself. I can't put up with this pain any longer and I feel like I'm bothering my parents with my issues. It felt like a stab in the heart when they told me they were ashamed in me for doing what I did. The last thing I want to do is disappoint my parents and I have been tempted to just run away so that they don't have to worry about my issues. I'm tempted to just run away now and go to the park so I can just kill myself. I just don't want to be a burden to anyone anymore. I'm a failure and a loser.",
464,"It's becoming so tempting I can't stop thinking about just giving up, everything in my life seems to be sliding towards that.

I tried so hard to pull myself out of that. I eliminated my brother from my life, I haven't spoken to him in about 9 months, I got out of a school where I was being continually harrassed, and I actually felt kind of hopeful. Now I'm back to the same place again. I have been sleeping through school and basically just through life, my family thinks I'm just a disgusting lost cause and I feel so trapped. It looks like im going to have to go back to the school wherei was bullied. Everything is falling apart and I have nothing that I care about. I feel so worthless and all that sees to happen is me getting out down by other people. I tried to be proactive, I looked for a therapist to talk gland I was trying to stay above this, but she basically made things ten times more difficult. The only thing stopping me from just ending it is fear. I don't want to fail and end up in a situation with no way out. I feel so trapped and I don't know what to do. Sorry if this doesn't make sense, I've been feeling really strung out all day with all these thoughts going through my head, I just had to put them somewhere before they overwhelmed me.",

We were both totally shocked and devastated. He ultimately chose her and told me I was a mistake. I wouldn't/couldn't have taken him back even if he had chose me, but his rejection was just the worst twist of the knife.

I am giving up because no matter what I do I won't feel better. I'm tried of people asking about my arms thinking that is the problem-the problem is not that I cut. Its WHY I cut. And the reason I do it is because it helps the pain. I cant control what you do to me but I can control what I do to myself. Im done with trying because nothing works. I dont want people to judge me and think I'm weird or crazy because they dont understand me. Thats why I came here because i thought people would understand.,
469,"confused teenager HI all. This is my very first post here. Just a few minutes ago I read some threads and it actually gave me the courage to write one myself... I feel depressed as far as I can remember myself. All I remember from my early childhood my parents were arguing about stupid things... But it was really bad because dad sometimes hit mom in front of me... I don't really know if that's the reason I feel so bad... Last year I started skipping school. Nobody except my parents noticed. When they found out dad yelled at me a lot and for a few weeks he was really mad at me and didn't even talk to me. I skipped school because I felt really bad for some reason and after dad's yelling something inside me changed - I got worse than I thought I could ever be. I stopped skipping school but my soul started to fall apart just like my family. A few months ago It seemed like the atmosphere was getting better(at least in the house - my soul was still fading away) but I was totally wrong - dad stopped eating with us and separated from the family... That's not the first time this has happened but I think that this time it is permanent. Maybe my depression comes from there but I'm not sure... I thought a lot about suicide but never tried. I even imagined it sometimes... I said to myself ""Look how easy it is"" For some reason something helped me to stop myself. But now as the days are passing by I cry almost every night and still think that if I was never born my parents were gonna be happier. I think a lot about a suicide especially the past week. I have no Idea what's happening to me and why... I even don't really know if this thread is for here or not... if it's not - sorry ...",
470,"Very close to the edge Over the past few weeks I have gone back an forth with depression and suicidal thoughts. At this moment I am just severely depressed, but suicide is still is still in the back of my mind. The cause of this is that fact that I just did something so stupid that I deserve to end it all. Things were going great, i was getting back into my art, having fun, working on my relationship with my wife, job was okay (still boring, but I have a pay check that pays the bills). Well while at work I got caught abusing the internet. Well the internet police at my job called me in for an interview and I explained to them what I was doing. Since I was honest about what I was doing they did not get to mad, but they still have to do a report.... My issue now is that I need to let my supervisor know what has happen before the report goes to lead contractor office. I do not want her to be blindsided by my stupidity. What makes this bad is that she has put alot of faith in me, and I should have known better. Yeah I know a lot of you are thinking that what is the big deal... Well I cannot give details, but while using the internet I was doing some research for an Age Regression Story that I am writing, and some to the searches results were not good. I really screwed myself on this one. I so badly want end it now, but if i do it would be like I was admitting to doing something wrong... In truth I did not do anything wrong other than wasting time at work... Still I do not know how to explain this to my supervisor. I cannot continue to hide this, and it will be better if I tell her than for the report to come down the chain. I spent a couple of days looking up how to commit suicide but make it look like an accident. The more i searched, the more I realized that there is now real way to cover this up. Also I have been going over my religious beliefs and suicide is a big no no... One more thing I have read a few other post on this site and I see that other have problems too... I am so confused now that I need a few kind words or maybe a push to go one way or the other. any help would be greatly appreciated.",
471,"Lines and lines and lines and lines Ok- I've got a method and I've got a timeframe and I've got a plan. I'm out of jokes. But, I do have an obligation to talk about this.",
472,"There doesn't seem to be any options left other than suicide I have been dealing with depression and OCD since my teenage years. Through the years I have taken SSRI, SNRI, NDRI, Tricyclics, and 5 ECTs. None have worked. From what it looks like, my situation will only get worse. Like if I knew it's gonna be like what it is now, in last year, I would have done anything I could to kill myself, I could not imagine that I would be in so much pain and despair that I am now,that I could feel so shitty, and I had already tried to end my life 3 times back then. It's like, the sadness in my chest is exploding, I can't contain it anymore. I have to wrestle with the idea of suicide every morning that I wake up and every night that I go to bed. More than a decade of dealing with 'mental health professionals' has resulted in nothing but disappointment. At this point I can neither afford a therapist nor any medication. I had to quit my last 3 jobs in the last 5 years. About 4 months ago, I had to completely give up on working since it's impossible to deal with sadness while working, hell it's impossible to get out o bed. Dealing with friends and family also has always made things worse. Whenever I show a sign of depression they can't help themselves but to call me a loser or spout something to the effect of ""why are you like this, what the fuck is wrong with you"". Through the last decade I have tried everything that my idiot friends have suggested: yoga, psychedelics, working out, hiking, traveling, etc.. through all of them I felt incredibly bored, stupid, disappointed and sad. There doesn't seem to be any option left other than ending my life. I just want this sadness and disappointment to end, I can't take any more of this misery.I don't wonna wake up another day, thinking about suicide and crying all day in my bed until I feel numb and pass out, I want all of this to end.",
473,"If it Weren't For My Family I'd Kill Myself Having yet another problem with school, crying...if I didn't have a family who would miss me I'd kill myself now.",
474,"At the proverbial crossroads I'm in the prime of my life both physically and talent-wise. I'm intelligent, fun, have a good heart/soul and handsome (if that really matters). Some say I have it all but, in reality, I don't. I hit rock bottom this year due to depression. I'm not a smoker, drug user, gambler or drinker but I literally lost everything I had after my car accident. I went into a depression after my accident (which wrote off my SUV) and due to a concussion, I didn't really come out of it very well at all. I sank into a really bad depression immediately after my accident, became irritable and moody, isolated myself from my girlfriend and family/friends and just drifted into a really dark place. I lost all my money, slept for 12-14 hours a day, lost interest in pretty much everything I liked to do and lost my job. I moved out of my girlfriend's place because I just wasn't in love with her anymore. She didn't fight me on it either, so I'm guessing she felt the same way too. I had tried to leave before my accident too a few times, so it wasn't something implusive but I think being depressed gave me a reason to do it, it wasn't courage as much as it was just time to move on. I'm living with my parents now and they're pretty good people, they just don't understand though what I'm going through. I'm not the face of depression, I hid it pretty well and I don't say much about what I went through either. I don't think they could help me anyway because they're the types that it's better ""out of sight, out of mind"", if they don't acknowledge something, it doesn't exist. I've thought about just ending it all for a while now. Nothing gruesome either, just death by charcoal (CO2) in an old storage container I have access to. Even as I was depressed there was glimmers of hope, some small things to cling to but I feel as though they aren't enough to keep going. Even as I write this outside on a beautiful day, the sun shining in my face isn't enough to convince me that living is the best thing. I'm tired these days, not from being sleepy or lack of exercise, I'm just tired of life, it's worn me down now and I don't think I'm able to ever get back the days where life was exciting and fun again. I'm depressed for sure but I'm not dangerous or even mentally ill, quite the opposite actually. I'd gladly give up my own life to save someone else's. I'm articulate to write letters (and I've started them already) to my family and friends about why I'm tired and decided to take my own life. I try to be positive and cling to hope but I think it's just a losing battle now, I'm past the point of being sad and sullen, I'm just worn down now. I guess I'm not asking anyone if it's OK to think about suicide, rather, if they feel the same way or just know what it's like to be tired of life.",
475,"Surely i have the right to die and not be forced to live After reading the other thread, people saying that suicide is the cowards way out, and a comment that got to me is, you gotta fight to live, why? I have no purpose im always unhappy nothing is ever good. I never wanted to be born. I dont fit in to the world around and my own skin, surely if i want to die im not being a coward, im making a decision about my life. Theres no end purpose to fighting to stay alive... atall... life has no meaning.",

478,"Dead end life I've hit a dead end wall. 9 months ago I was diagnosed with a serious, incurable, lifelong disease. It is debilitating. Every day I have constant nausea (sometimes retching and vomiting), stomach pain and live in fear of excruciating renal colic as my body is constantly making kidney stones. I have been in hospital about 11 times in the last year for surgical procedures. I am 18. I cannot see how I can live through this. My friends have abandoned me, and I am finding it SO hard to deal with my diagnosis. I am seeing a counsellor, but.. I am having severe anxiety problems and I just don't see the point in living anymore, every day is a battle. I thought I was coping well but have been feeling more and more depressed. I do not feel as if I can go on like this. I can't imagine a future for myself. Just don't know what to do anymore.",
479,"I just feel empty. I'll start off telling you that I'm fifteen, I know that seems like ""oh you're too young to understand depression"" and all that jazz, but whatever. I just feel empty, like there's something missing, constantly. I was asked about how I felt today, by a friend, the only way I could describe life was that I was in a bubble, just watching everything pass by, and to be honest, I don't care. I don't feel anything, I don't feel depressed, but at the same time, I just don't feel happy. I find myself thinking sometimes, about how tiring it is just being here, because that's what it is, I'm not upset anymore, I'm past that, I'm just tired. I just want everything to stop. I cry at the stupidest things. I found an old CD the other day, it was the first one I bought, and halfway through the fifth track I just fell into self-despair, crying silently, but again, I wasn't upset. It just reminded me of a time when I was happy, which feels like so long ago now. I'm just scared, I have all these images inside, of me, killing myself. And, sadistic as it is, it brings a smile to my face. Because I just see myself, at peace. But I'm too scared to try it again, because I've tried it eight times, each one became increasingly more painful. And then, I turned to self-harm, generically I went to cutting, but then that wasn't enough, so I started burning my flesh, in the end it just meant nothing. So now? I'm resorted to just slowly getting by, losing more and more of myself every single day. I've resorted hitting myself, with metal objects mainly, bruising myself, a more constant pain, but as with everything, I know it just won't be enough. I'm to scared to ask for help, but I'm even more scared of what I'm becoming.",

I don't wanna get out of this bed and I don't wanna meet anyone, I wanna lay here and rot away. And even if I do find some glimpse of joy I can't hold on to it more than a half-hour or so. So why should I continue? Why should I fight to survive the everyday life? I can't hold myself together and I don't have the energy to go on. I'm already screwing up the few things in my life that are allright, why should I continue? All this life ever got me is HURT and PAIN. I'm sick of it all.",
482,"End Game Ive been plagued by circumstances and a overall lack of my life I'm depressed and fixated on ending it, why ? Well maybe because life is so unbearable that I've led myself to the brink and never plummeted time and time again. I've come so close that at this point i can't differentiate the line between surviving and giving up. I can't escape my past and a family that has given me nothing but abuse and a mother that orchestrates the bulk of it. Maybe i should call 911 and plead insanity and get myself locked away and heavily medicated but one thing stopping that and that is hey would you look at that i have no health insurance and can feel the results of prolonged stress take its toll on my body. Shall i lie down and succumb to a prolonged death or a cryptic suicided marred by emotions and excessive wordplay, In all honesty i feel like I've lost it and can't recover this time but how could i be suffering from a mental breakdown if I'm able to type and describe what I'm feeling ? i am, so far gone that i reckon its for the best and nobody can deter that why ? because you eventually grow tired of suffering and leading a miserable life in which your limited because of your afflictions and nobody cares. We are the damned and demented souls that are forced to roam this morbid earth without a real outlet or way to overcome this downpour of sad feelings and abusive wordplay inflicted upon oneself. I used to love more than anything, i never held hate, never wanted those who hurt me to die until now. As today goes it was normal at first until i was greeted with a phone call from my estranged mother detailing how my older brother proceeded to beat her head in and how police rushed her house once again and created more hell to combat the shitstorm that was already that house and then through it all I'm being told that I'm to blame no not the 28 year old woman beater with nothing to show for just me the anti christ, the proverbial demon spewed out from Satans underbelly to be sent to this world only to harass those before me ? i want death more than anything yet theres nothing more frightening than the thought of it. that is a big conundrum if I've ever seen one, am i right ? how can what disturbs one most be the end all of all ends the salvation that he so freakishly requires is only to be achieved upon the last beat of my heart ? or the poison that pollutes my blood. Life is too painful to endure any longer, as i type i feel my brain ready to implode and the pains being issued from my heart aren't subtle ......",
483,"i will always be this way so what's the point I should just accept that I will always feel this way. I use to tell myself the problem with depression is it makes you feel like you'll be this way forever even though you won't. That was over 10 years ago. I guess I was wrong. All these years later, I still feel like this. I don't see the use in continuing to do this to myself. I won't get better.

487,"Should I continue on? Well I guess I can start by telling my story. I'm John and I'm 15 I know that I'm pretty young but I feel like life isn't worth living anymore. Ive been depressed since I was 12, Ive been hospitalized for self-harm, depression, suicidal thoughts and anger. I just feel completely worthless and I have no hope for my future. I'm a loner, I literally have no friends all I do is stay home all day. My day basically consists of just sitting home then going to sleep. I mean I enjoy being alone but then I don't because that always leaves me to my thoughts and when I think a lot it usually doesn't end well. I start thinking about how much I hate myself, how alone I am, how useless I really am, how I probably would just be better off dead because I'm not really needed here, ill never do any good for this world. I'm literally horrible at everything they only thing I'm probably good at is reading but Ive lost interest in that. My dad and sister always tell me that ill never amount to anything because of how stupid I am, which is true I am stupid, I cant do the simplest things. All I do is get put down by everybody especially my dad, he always calls me a fat ass, stupid, ill never be good enough. It really sucks to be put down by your own dad. My childhood wasn't the best when my family was together (my dad and mom are now divorced) I got put down a lot as a child because of the way I look and how fat I am how ugly I was, my own parents told me this. Now school was complete hell I got picked on all the time, but the worst part was that I couldn't even tell my own parents because they would careless so I would just bottle everything up until I couldn't handle it anymore so that's when I would cut myself to just relieve the emotional pain for a little. So my cutting really got worse when I went to deep by accident and had to be rushed to the hospital. That is when my parents found out that I was cutting myself. My dad never really understood he just looked at me like I'm crazy, but my mom was more understanding because she has had depression before and has been hospitalized also. So after getting stitched up they had a therapist come and evaluate me and that's when I started going to therapy. It was all good for awhile I was doing fine but then my dad didn't want me going anymore because he said he was wasting money for nothing. So a few weeks later I fell back into my old habits with cutting so my mom decided to home school me for 8th grade thinking that would help with the bullies at school but it really didn't because I was still getting bullied at home by my own father. Now for 9th grade I decided to go to public school thinking I would get a fresh start. Surprisingly I didn't get bullied much which was a plus, I got called names every now and then but it wasn't serious. I still wasn't happy with my life or with myself I never wanted to go to school because I was so horrible at it that I was failing and even when I tried I still failed. I never had any friends in school I was just one of those loners who sat by themselves at lunch. I thought that high school was supposed to be the &quot;time of your life&quot; but for me it was far from that. I got so upset when I saw other kids having fun hanging out with their friends and here's me not talking to anyone and being alone most of the time. It was hard for me to find friends because I'm a shy person I tend to keep to myself. So after awhile I just stopped trying and didn't want to get out of bed anymore, I just thought whats the point? I mean ill never succeed in life, ill never amount to anything, I'm worthless, nobody would miss me if I'm gone, I'm just a burden. That's what was always running through my head. I never had anything positive to say about myself. It just got so overwhelming that I turned to drugs like weed, pills and alcohol to numb the pain and just to be able to feel happy. Now the night times were probably the worst for me, I don't really understand why but that's when I literally go crazy like all the negative thoughts come out and I just brake down thinking why am I still alive? So one night I had attempted suicide and my dad found me in time and that's when I ended up being hospitalized for about a month inpatient and 2 weeks outpatient. They put me on Prozac for a month which sorta worked for awhile but then my dad stopped getting them thinking I don't need them anymore. So here I am now falling back into my old habits. Still being a loner being in the same position I was a few years ago.I can't tell my dad about how I feel because he always yells at me or tells me I'm crazy. I have the urges to cut all the time but I'm able to fight it. I currently live with just my dad now which is okay I guess, I mean he's never home anymore. I'm alone like most of the day. I just feel like nobody really cares anymore, everybody has given up on me. My mom doesn't talk to me anymore and I miss her a lot, I have nobody that I can talk to anymore because everybody has walked out of my life and now I just see no point in moving forward in my useless life I'm going nowhere. I know I'm only 15 but Ive just ran out of hope for the future. I understand that there are people out there who have it worse than me and thats why I just feel so selfish but I'm just not happy with life anymore and think why should I continue living a life that I'm not happy with?",
488,"i dont belong. I havent always been like this. When i was little i was probably the happiest kid you have ever seen, up until i was about 7 or 8. Thats when it started, the hitting and abuse. My dad was my best friend or so i thought. He had a terrible angerment issue, i despise him now. He always used to tell me 'you worthless, please die'. He would throw me against walls and beat me until there was absolutely nothing left. When i was 10 it stopped because of my mom. Now im 14,and it still hurts inside because now i have nightmares almost every night about him. In school, i cant concentrate at all. I also get made fun of a lot. They call me 'that akward girl'. I have no friends of course. No one ever gave a thought to talk to me, its like im alone, which i am and always will be. I started to turn to online games like runescape ect. I met people on there but i knew they would all never be real friends, so no matter what im lonely. My mom tries really hard to break down my walls and i hate it. She will NEVER truly know me or get to know me. She takes me out to do things but who really gives a fuck. I dont wanna get up or do anything, im perfectly content sitting in my room alone. I just dont know how to live with myself anymore, i despise myself, my body, and living. There is no point because there is nothing nor no one out there who will truly ever care.",

Everything seemed to stop and I just lost the plot, I was on such a high too. I turn 18 tomorrow, everything was going so well, now I just want to jump off a bridge. My grandmother who still talks to the abuser, doesn't seem to be turning up to my birthday, which is gutting, even though i've not overly been speaking to her lately, because she crossed a line, she went over the the abusers house when my brother was doing some athletics event, just to spite my mum. I've sent her multipul messages saying her and her partener are invited and... nothing. I opened the card from her and she said that she doesn't understand why I didn't invite her. It's like she's abandoned me. I lost it at my best friend yesterday, she's so selfabsorbed and I turned to her after I saw the abuser and she just blanked my message and I didn't hear anything untill later that night and she wanted to whine at me about boys and sex.

But because I can't get up the courage to end it, I'm just living in a way that will lead to dying quicker. My hope is that I'll die in my sleep of a heart attack or stroke or maybe pass out behind the wheel, something where it happens before I even know it, so I can't chicken out. I just want it to be over, but I don't have the guts to do anything about it. I'm dying a slow death, which I guess is the best I can expect.",

494,"Tired of going through :cry: I'm twenty-three and I have only been on my own twice in my life time. I went to my hometown to take care of a family member and was promised before I left my current home that I would have somewhere to stay when I got back. At the moment I felt like I was being told a lie but I went against my better judgement and decided to trust this person. While I was away I called almost every week to make sure that everything was alright. I asked if I needed to stay in my hometown and was told ""no"". I came back home to find out that I didn't really have anywhere to stay. My ""friend or my sister"" (and I use the two words loosely) decided that she wanted to work things out with her husband and I'm not mad at that. I'm really the type of person who wants everyone around me to be happy. I told her that I was glad that she decided to work things out. I told her that I didn't have anywhere to go here and she said that I could stay with her and her family for a few days. A few days turned into a few weeks. It's going on a month but I've already started working. When I got home tonight I found a letter on my bed saying that I had until Sunday to find somewhere else to live. I have no money and I don't have anywhere else to go here so I called a friend who lives in MS. They said that they would send me a bus ticket tomorrow but I don't want to go there and start this cycle all over again. I'm tired of being a burdon on everyone. I feel like everything would be better if I would just die. I don't want to live like this anymore. When I lay down again I will lay down forever.",
495,"Suicidal Without Depression? 23 and female with the whole world ahead of me. I'm not sure how I've found myself typing into the unknown at 10pm on a Sunday night, but here I am. I suppose i'm just looking for some insight that i can't find through google. As the title suggests, i wouldn't consider myself depressed. In saying that I mean my mood is stable, i'm involved socially, academically and physically with life, independent financially, work, contribute to society etc. etc. No changes in any of that at all. No anxiety, trouble concentrating, disturbed sleeping patterns or traumatizing prior events. The only thing is the constant thoughts and sometimes, impulses towards taking my own life. It's like a gentle thought that flows not aggressively but with quiet consistently in the back of my brain. I find myself looking up methods without realizing i'm opening the page. I try to find websites with suicide notes so I can understand the victims final thoughts, and maybe find some connection to my own. Occasionally i'll get this sudden feeling in my chest, like taking the downward drop on a roller coaster, where I feel like i need to take my own life and if not right now, soon. I've tried to identify my thought patterns but all I can surmise is that life in it's essence is meaningless/purposelessness, so why delay the inevitable? Although, I honestly think I've only created this thought out of desperation to find a reason to these feelings. Does anyone else have consistent thoughts and/or impulses with the absence of depression or any other mental health illnesses? Everything I read runs depression and suicidal thoughts as synonymous or relates suicidal impulses as a pain escape mechanism. What if there is no pain to escape from?",
496,"On meds, but miss being able to end it all This may sound strange, and I hope no one criticises me for it, but ever since I've been on my meds I miss being able to have the strength to harm myself. Sounds strange to most people, but the meds have taken away the mental strength I have to kill myself. Which is probably what they were supposed to do. But I feel like I've lost a way out now. Like my escape route has been cut off. Does anyone else feel this way, or is is just me???????",

Almost seems normal to me to go there,Although I could never do that to my family, Like to know if anyone can relate? Thanks, Hopeful 1",

499,"If you have a minute to read this. I am going to try not to write a book here, I am 34, dad of 4 kids(oldest 10)....4 years ago my wife found prescription pills(pretty much anything pain/sleeping/muscle relaxer). She has briefly tried getting help but always has a reason. I have long threatened to divorce her, but you know the heart is a crazy thing. Three weeks ago my wife nearly burned the house down after prying open the safe and taking a fist full of sleeping pills(it wasn't a suicide attempt, she has a high tolerance). I mean if everything hadn't landed the way it did, I wouldn't have my kids right now. So I told her this is it, that I wasn't going to risk their lives further. So here we are, she hasn't done a thing since that(sans getting more pills), I feel like I am just at my limit. I know for a fact that if I divorce my wife that she will commit suicide if I divorce her, as if just the pain of divorcing someone you still love isn't hard enough. Beyond that my kids do not understand whats going on, so in previous issues they have all sided with my wife, and see me as the villain, as anyone with kids know they lack a filter. Yes I have spoken with my doctor about depression(not suicide thoughts), they feel that I am logically processing and dealing with extreme stress as well as one can. I can't bring up suicide at all as it would be a determent to a case if my wife were to fight for custody(I think she will take the earlier route), which I can't let her have as she isn't fit at this point to do that. My family is already giving all the support they can, I sadly am left with just two friends that understand and have been around, one is completely unable to understand in a normal manner emotions and issues, my other friend is more of a BS around friend(although I know he is concerned as of late of my mental state as he has asked). I usually hide behind a thick wall of sarcasm and humor, but I can't seem to keep my thoughts away from darkness. I think about it often, sheer will power is all that keeps me going and with my wife still doing what she is doing and the impending destruction of everything we have built over the last 15 years is horrifying. I actually had a great grandfather and great uncle who committed suicide long before I was born, I have spent a great many hours wondering what and why. I hope that I won't, but I want to post this, I could use some extra hope. Everything just seems so dark. I think I failed at not writing that book...sorry about that.",

503,"Becoming suicidal completely changed my perception I've been depressed in the past, but I always held out hope for the future. Lately though I can't say that hope is still there. More and more I feel backed into a corner without any options. Medication is helping, but the hopelessness is still there about the future. The worst thing is all the realizations I've come to have and my perception of the world flipped upside down. I find myself wondering about death more and more. I also question any afterlife now which I had always believed there was something in the past. But the more I live with this altered perception the more tormented I feel. I see everything in a dark way now. I see no good left in the world. I see pain. Happiness and joy seem like nothing more than meaningless passing emotions. The purpose of life has been questioned. I see now why some people commit suicide and it's a frightening reality. I know how I was before this and I feel like I'll never be able to find that side of me again. Maybe it's just me getting older, but there's the depression too. The scary thought that nobody is going to come save us from ourselves. And this is it, once your dead it's just like you were before you were born. That's scary as well. I hope I can feel joy again one day.",
504,"Scared by how tempting it is... I'm not sure where to start, but here is the source of my pain... I moved in with my boyfriend of 8 years last December. We just moved 1500 miles away from home together and the day after we move in to the new place he says he is no longer in love with me. 8 years, but he couldn't stand sharing a roof with me for even 1?! I put my life on hold to make sure he could have his dream job. I had noticed him growing more distant for a few months but I thought it was just stress at work... I can't go home because I don't have enough money for the trip. He claims to still ""love"" me, but is no longer ""IN love"". I begged him to try to fall in love with me again because I have no where to go and I can't bear the thought of living with him while he tries being single. We hardly talk or touch even though we still share a bed. Now, every morning I browse the internet ways to kill myself. Usually the content focuses on how much worse it is if you fail- and that has been enough of a deterrent. Logically I know suicide makes more problems than it solves and maybe I would be happy again if I could somehow leave him...but even that thought is so viscerally upsetting that I am crying and fantasizing about death while I type. I don't know what to do and thinking about the future is so bleak... I have no one to talk to - thus why I turn to the internet to express myself.",

506,"Don't even care anymore I really don't care about anything anymore to the point where I no longer care about trying to cheer myself up, or doing anything to make myself comfortable, or happier. To explain a bit about how I got here let me start by saying it's been a very long time since I have been genuinely happy, and the few times I have been happy it's for a short time and it's always followed by way more sadness. I'm 17 now, I finished high school last june, a year younger because I skipped a grade. At high school I had almost no real friends, and there's nobody from there now that I could consider a real friend. What makes it worse is that it was an all-guys school, so not only do I have no male friends but I barely even know any girls. Growing up, I had no real friends, an abusive father, both my parents focused me solely on school, never any physical activities so I'm scrawny on top of everything else. I always told myself that being unhappy was just temporary and this was just a shitty phase in my life and things would be better when I went to university but that made things even worse. I moved to a school 8 hours away, the only person I knew there was pretty much one of my only friends from high school. I only managed to stay there for a semester though, I have very bad ADD, but despite being diagnosed, my parents wouldn't get me any medication saying they thought it was bad for me and that I was just faking it and didn't really need any medication, I was just lazy and needed to work harder. Because of my ADD I find it next to impossible to sit down and do school work which means I always underachieve which is a shame because I feel like I'm actually intelligent if I could find the ability to do the work. Anyways, going to university only made things worse. My mom's the only person I care about in the world and if being away from her wasn't hard enough, my dad called and told me that my mom's dying from high blood pressure. He told me that it's all my fault, her blood pressures rising because she's worried about me. At the same time the only girl I've ever liked a) hooked up and started dating the so-called friend from high school, and b) started telling me she was depressed and suicidal and needed my help. I still cared about her a lot even though she had literally just broken my heart so I helped her as best as I could as a friend and got her through it. A couple of weeks later in December she breaks up with my old friend and starts seeing me. I told her from the beginning that I loved her but that I was worried because she really could hurt me, but I cared so much I trusted her and opened myself up to her again. Now during this entire process, I also started smoking weed daily, it became one of the only things that could relax me and help take away some of my depression. By Christmas time, because of all the anxiety, depression, ADD, and a whole host of other problems I had failed 2 of my 5 courses. My parents pulled me out of school on January the 5th. I had to move back in with my parents, of course, my parents blamed me, and the weed for me failing and even kicked me out of the house for 3 weeks. I spent most of the time at a friends house (also no longer a friend, and he was literally the last one I had). I moved back in with my parents house after spending 3 days living homeless. During these 3 weeks I needed to steal from grocery store's just to have something to eat, otherwise I'd have literally starved. I only moved back in with my parents house after I got caught stealing from a store and the police called them for me. Suicide's something that I've thought about my entire life. When I was younger it used to be once or twice a year, but the frequency of the thoughts have been increasing constantly, and ever since my parents pulled me out of school there hasn't been a single day I haven't thought about just killing myself to end all this shit. I feel like my life's useless and a waste of time, I don't see anything ever going right for me. Of course the girl I cared about dumped me after I had to move 8 hours a day, but if that wasn't hard enough today she started fucking with my head even more texting me telling me she misses me and shit like that. I'm just so tired of living now, I literally don't care about anything, going back to school, getting back with her, getting a job, I don't give a shit about any of it. I have no motivation, nothing I care about, it's all meaningless to me, there isn't anything I value and even though I want there to be somebody that I could care about deeply there really isn't, I'm that lonely.",
507,"I think it's officially over Right now I'm at the worst point of my life. It's hard to even type this. There's a girl who was my best friend for years that I loved more than anyone.

Both of them are saying suggestive things to each other and it gives me a lot of pain seeing this. I loved this whore for so long and now she's just acting this way with other people and dumped me like I'm worthless. At this point I'm starting to accept that the relationship may be over.... even though it breaks my heart into a million pieces to admit that....... worst part is seeing her with another man......

Even more anxiety over the food. Then a close freind to this person, an internet buddy, told me she had died - suicide. That literally pushed me off the ledge. All this pressure beeing pushed down, I knew it was only a matter of time before the bubble burst. I can hardly keep from crying, my throat is clogged and I can't keep from wishing I was dead. Can't go out for a jog and I can't sleep. Have nothing more left than this to keep down the angst. I don't know how long I can take it.",

I alienate people because of my bad personality. I've tried to change it for years and I can't. I have failed miserably at every aspect and endeavor of my life, from the important to the mundane. I'm 25 years old and still live with my parents and living off them financially. I was expelled from college for failing grades. I spent 3 years at college and didn't make it beyond freshman status. I only graduated high school because a couple of teachers felt sorry for me. My grades were the lowest of all my graduating class. All of my cousins and siblings have graduated from top universities. My brother is currently attending grad school at Duke, my sister is getting her masters, my cousin is a Yale graduate, my neice graduated from Vanderbilt, etc. All of my cousins, siblings, and friends are professionals. I am nothing but trash. I have failed. My father is 71 and will not be able to retire because I wasted his savings on college that I failed at. I'm financially dependant so he will never be able to retire. Girls are repulsed by me and alwasy have been. My problems go beyond the standard scope.

By continuing to live I am wasting precious time, space, money, and resources that could be used by people who are much worthier. There needs to be societal customs that encourage suicide for people like me. Everything will be better when I'm no longer sickening the world with my existence.

I want to commit suicide. Maybe my suicide will be the only thing I did right. I know when I'm gone everything will be better. We sell ourselves this lie that ""every life is precious"".

520,"Story of my life (long) Well my story is a long one, I'll try to keep it brief and to the point so you don't get bored. I was born in Asia, I was brought up in a strict family with angry who used to beat me with a stick. This might sound horrendous, but apparently if you speak to an Asian kid, they'd think its normal. Anyway, I don't think I've ever felt happiness, my parents constantly tell me that I'm ungrateful. I remember one evening I told my mother I was unhappy all the time, and she told me that I took everything for granted and that I'm so ungrateful for feeling like that, my dad had also said that to me. Most weekend I was told to study and study. Granted every kid get told to study, but my parents only wanted results, my happiness and ability to live life didn't matter, I was always severely depressed, very harsh bully during secondary school made it even worse, I seriously considered suicide at the time, I was 12. Then, my parents decided that I was to study in Europe, little did I know that it would be the best years of my life, I experienced freedom, independence, true friendship, things that I never experienced. During which, I suffer from my controlling brother, who seems to think that, because we don't live with my parents, he is the man of the family, under his control, I silently endure his ridiculous ""laws"", his intimidating personality and everything for 3 years, he is an angry person like my father, he seemed that he is always right and that I have to listen to him, no matter what. One day, I came home late, he questioned me and start throwing things everything and tried to strangled me, I faught back, that was one of the very first time I stood up for myself. I gave him the coldest stare and walked away. He went to university and moved away and I didn't speak to him for many years. As for my parents, its also the same. I'm not allowed to have an opinion, not allowed to have my own will, not even allowed to be unhappy - otherwise its ungrateful. I have to say, my dad has changed for the better, but my mother still kept her beliefs, and they still think that because they are parents, I have to agree with everything they say. So my life fast forwards to present day, my education in Europe is completed, I wanted to stay in Europe so much, I tried everything I could to get a job in Europe so that I could stay, but the euro crisis and recession made that impossible. I knew that once I return, everything will be the same again, I'd have to leave everyone and everything that I love and care about to go to a place where you could almost say I despise, live my life like a puppet waiting to die. But it happened, I'm typing this in my family home in Asia, after all these years I'm back, and just as I knew, everything that I dreaded might happen, has happen. I'm now just a puppet, living to make other happy, waiting to die, or am I already dead? I'm not allowed to leave home anymore, my parents will do everything to make me stay, everything to make me feel bad if I leave. My hopes and dreams are not important to them, I want to be somewhere where I can be myself, open up my mind and find my way though life, but I suppose this is just fate, because life is unfair, everyone knows that. Suicide, I cannot deny that it flashes on my mind from time to time, but I would never attempt, I'm doing this as an expression of gratefulness towards my parents for raising me, even though now I look at myself, I do not even know who I am anymore, that beautiful moments of freedom turn into a memory once upon a time, that I will treasure for eternally. Perhaps one day, decades later, I will once again stand on the soil of Europe, when I've complete my duty of gratefulness. Thank you for reading my story.",
521,"Another sad story. I've already posted here before, but feeling sad again so I need to let it out... I had bad luck from the beginning. I was born with a poor health in a corrupted country and a poor town with no opportunities. I had brain damage which resulted in constant headaches and nose bleeds during childhood. Headaches still persist..While growing up viruses had been attacking me mercilessly. Endless visits to clinics and endless waiting in lines seemed to have been a norm. I've had numerous respiratory infections. A few times It got so serious, that I was admitted in a hospital for treatment. I also wasn't growing properly for whatever reason. My parents are slightly below average height, but kids usually grow taller right? No... And doctors couldn't figure out why. THey'd taken various blood tests and xrays, but strangely enough, nothing was found that would be the reason for slow growth.. Eventually I stopped at 5.2.5 at 14 y.o. Being picky with food didn't improve things. We'd had so many fights over food, but I just couldn't eat half of what our family could afford.. When school began- things got worse. The food there was disgusting and I ignored it of course. Besides that, breaks between classes were so short, that half of students would attack cafeteria and whoever wasn't fast enough -would not be able to buy anything.. Stomach problems began and I guess eventually my organism just ate away whatever 'meat' and muscles I'd had in order to survive, and so I became even skinner and unhealthy-looking. Now that I'm 20 and my physical flaws are destroying whatever's left of my self-esteem. I have small fingers,arms, face, jaws, eyes..everything is small. Almost every girl has bigger and thicker bones than me. I started obsessing over this and comparing myself to everybody, and 9 times out of 10 I'm smaller. I'm easily intimidated by people who have strong voice, bigger body and bigger everything. But I suppose it's my fault for not eating so I probably deserve it now. I didn't score personality-wise either. Always having been the shyest, quietest and on top of all -tiny -has practically turned me into a ghost. I'm socially disabled even. People look right through me and literally run into me. Failing university and eventually running out of money for tuition -I had to quit and then plunged into my hobbies which don't bring any income. Due to low body mass -I get exhausted even from taking a walk to a grocery store. And unfortunately, financial problems are always with us so good food is still out of the question and given the fact that I'm left alone with my mom who's retired and barely manages to get by herself, I'm just dragging her down into this hole I'm in.. So- whoever says life gets better is a liar. I know there are situations incomparable to mine, but at least those people have healthy bodies. Me -I'm just screwed, every simple thing is a challenge.. So what is there left to live for? I'm starting to become irrelevant to anything that has ever interested my tiny mind, because without good looks -It doesn't even matter. Before saying anything, imagine yourself in my body first.",

524,"The darkness like a blanket covers my mind I'm not sure if you're able to relate but i just wanted to tell someone how i feel and i cant talk to anyone i know, because I've tried before and none of them understand. I'm 17 years old and since i was 14 i have often contemplated what this forum discusses and tried twice but was stopped in one attempt and blacked out in another and survived. It's hard to describe what happens but it is sort of like waves, a hazy cloud that will enter my head and sit there like a dense fog and when it sinks in i am unable to think or work and sometimes i carve images and words into my arms and body (never were people can see because i don't want to talk to people about it or for them to bring it up) and i seem to cry myself to sleep a lot more often than i consider normal and i never cry in front of people but when i do cry it is uncontrollable. I am currently doing study in year12 at a small rural public school, i have a few close friends and i wouldn't say i have a lack of friends but i can't talk to any of them without freaking them out. My girlfriend broke up with me today because she didn't like the long distance and i really don't mind too much because we were more like friends anyway but i still really hurt about being left by the only person i have truly loved, and that was nearly six months ago now. Do you every just randomly feel afraid ? I don't really scare easily, i'm not afraid of any animals or of death but sometimes when i am sitting swirling in my thoughts i have a warm fuzzy feeling tingle up through my body and intensify into a serious fear and i'm not sure of what it is i fear it's possibly that i have no idea what i'm going to do with my life, or possibly that feeling that what i see isn't reality. I often get that feeling that my perception of reality is merely a deception from the truth. As a young child my mother took me to a psychiatrist and i had displayed great intelligence but was also diagnosed to be ADHD. I'm not sure if that's what's wrong with me or if it's something else but i am so scared I really just want one person to understand and to hold me and listen to me. I never speak of how i feel or bring up depressing subjects and always smile and laugh around the people i know and none of them know how i feel. I'm sure a few of them would be shocked to know that my suicidal tenancies still linger within me. In a world so full of people, busy streets and billions of faces. I have never felt so alone.",

For all those people who wanna live and do/did convince me to live, it boils down to the last no matter how hard u try to convince, I still cant find a reason to live ? or is it really worth living this life ?

The problem with that is that when I do go to see her all that I feel in numb. I think that it is just a coping mechanism that I use to not get hurt. I am not sure what to do. She is going to out of town for 3 weeks which is somewhat of a relief. To sleep per chance to dream. I told her that I feel like I am in a perpetual nightmare. I can never wake up from. She assured me that I wasn't dreaming. But how do we know for sure that life or someti=hing like it isn't just a bad dream that we are all going to wake up from eventually.

532,"I want to end it Hey, I don't know why I'm writing this, maybe it's my last cry for help. In the following paragrafs I would like to write my life story, maybe it could help someone not to make the same mistakes as me. I'm 21 and I was diagnosed for depression around 13 that's the first time I had contact with a professional, I do think it started way early in my life. When I was around 3 years old my older brother was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, he became very week, during this time every day me and my family would visit him at the hospital. Later he a psychologist told us ""he's a ticking time bomb"" as he showed a very depressive mood. We both are very much alike we look the same and act the same. In 2008 he attempted suicide. In 2009 he made another attempt. In 2011 he killed himself, life in this house never the same. What made him do it? I might have some answers. He was an introvert, during his teenage years like many he fell in love with a girl. However, he never asked her out, this was the first step to doom, anorexia followed shortly after. After his long recovery, he went back into college to finish his studies, he made it with and avg of 13 pretty good considering that he didn't attended classes He had no job so stayed home, there was a time that he worked with our father but depression as you all know is heavy. Later he met a girl everything was great, but sometimes people with depression become too attached to the ones they love.they broke up, this was the first suicide attempt. After that they became friends and another girls entered in his life but not for long.This was the second time. The third time i don't really have an answer maybe it might have been another girl, and the fact that he applied for several jobs but was always beaten by some guy that knew someone. When i died i became a beacon of hope for my family and as i saw how everyone reacted to his dead i promised to not kill myself as for around that time i had planned my suicide. In a way he saved my life, but i never wanted it, maybe if i was faster he would still be alive. As i wrote before we are very much alike, i only met a girl this year, we started talking via Facebook because I'm in college and i really don't have much time to see her, but I'm afraid she will never like me i want to give her my heart and soul but she will reject them. I was never good enough, hope that the never ending void will be more pleasant",

But I was in Disney Land; for example, despite having a below average IQ, I generally believed I was a genius. But I haven't written for two months, and I see myself in my true light: a tall, ugly weirdo with an IQ of 88. 2. Like most welfare parasites I'm also an alcoholic. I have tried to stop drinking through AA, Rational Recovery, the Christian Church ... I could go on! Every attempt, however, has resulted in a horrific relapse and the anti-social- and life degrading events that follow from excess drinking. 3. The last big problem I have is my perception of humanity. I don't like them, and I can't see any reason to - I don't hate everyone, but the general characterists of humanity make me sick. Their awkwardness, their materailism, their predictability, and their evil! Anyway ... I know we all have problems, but I really can't see a point in living - be honest, is there?

Well now after getting some work done in the project - not a lot, but at least a start - my ex-boss won't even look at it. Instead he asks why I'm not working and won't talk about anything else unless I give him a proper answer. I don't get it, why didn't he do this before he gave me the project? I feel betrayed that I spent time on this, maybe not get much done because I'm trying to relearn my skills, but it was wasted and my relationship with him is probably destroyed, now that he thinks I'm a loser. I don't have any reliable professional references now, well maybe one but not sure if that person still remembers me. I don't have any friends or know anybody, even family members outside of my parents. To make things worse, at the time this happened I was talking to someone who knows about my depression, and all of a sudden said ""I'm not talking to you anymore, I'm blocking you"" when I mentioned my problem, and later said ""I won't feel guilty if you [edited: suicide method]."" I don't know what to do. I'm reminded of a horror movie about zombies: at the end, all the zombies were killed and two people survived but they were in the middle of Antarctica with no supplies. They asked ""now what?"" and the movie ended. That's what I feel like right now. The only thing I have is my degree but with no job experience for over a year and now likely no good references I think I've wasted the last 7 years of my life. I feel like changing my mood to ""dead"". I'm losing my will to keep surviving.",
551,"Physical form. I am having so much trouble staying here right now.. The only reason I am sitting here at my desk, instead of popping as many pills as I can, is because of my parents downstairs right now. Normally I would think about my boyfriend, or if I was driving and feeling suicidal I would think of him and my parents and how they would feel when I'm gone. But right now that is absent for me... I do not care about that. I do, however, care about my parents physically finding me. I feel like everyone could get over the thought of me soon enough. But I know that physical images can stay forever in the mind.. and I don't want that to haunt them. If I were out right now, and somewhere I could hide the evidence of my body even existing, I would. Preferably water or fire, that way when someone did find me my remains would be eroded and I would be unrecognizable. It frustrates me knowing how attached they are to the physical portion of me. In all honesty, all they have known for the past few years is an empty, skin casing of who they think is me. If they could just realize that, then they wouldn't be so sad when they did find me, because they would know I was really gone all along. ..I remember when one of my dogs died of Pancreatitis about a year ago. I came home and found her lying stiffly on the kitchen floor on her side. Instead of covering her up I sat next to her against a cabinet and I stared into her eye. It was obviously blank and unmoving, but at that point I knew we had something in common. I saw it for what it was.. just an empty, hollow shell that once held something alive within it. When my mom gave birth to me I was born 3 months premature. They kept me in an incubator to sustain me for many, many months. Every day one of the babies around me in the ward would die; but miraculously, I somehow made it... Because of this, I sort of feel like I cheated death. Over the years I have tried to pay for it.. but now I feel like I owe it more than just my spirit. If I could give it my consciousness right now I would... I just don't want them to find me. I guess I don't really know why I'm posting this. I am not going to kill myself right now for their sake.. I guess I just wish I had someone to talk to who wouldn't be hurt if I told them these things.. and someone who understands what I describe.",

My dad is a diabetic and has needles to give himself insylun so I took a clean one and I use that to cut up my upper arm and sometimes my legs. I cut my lower arm so bad once that it probley needed stiches and the scar is huge. My mom didn't notice intil about half a week later and told EVERYONE!!!! And I was not ready for them to know about my very shameful problem. And she kept asking me ""what triggers this?"" and ""that's odd"" and it realy made me feel like a huge freak and lately I have also been Suicidal for the past few months but I am not going to tell my family especicaly not my mother",
555,please wake me up now I went to see my therapist and now I feel worse than I did before I went. She wants me to talk about what is going on inside of my head with her. The problem with that is that when I do go to see her all that I feel in numb. I think that it is just a coping mechanism that I use to not get hurt. I am not sure what to do. She is going to out of town for 3 weeks which is somewhat of a relief. To sleep per chance to dream. I told her that I feel like I am in a perpetual nightmare. I can never wake up from. She assured me that I wasn't dreaming. But how do we know for sure that life or someti=hing like it isn't just a bad dream that we are all going to wake up from eventually. Have you ever had a lucid dream?? That is what this feels like to me. I don't know what to do any more. I want to give up and give in...but I don't even know how to do that. I keep waiting to wake up.,
556,Can I be admitted for just feeling suicidal??? ***Recently I haven't been feeling my best I would say. I'm stressed out by the smallest of things and basically a emotional wreck. My therapist tells me a bunch of bullshit about how I'm this great person when I honestly don't see what he's talking about. I've been feeling more down by the day and just this night I had a dream about suicide as if I didn't think about it enough during the day I have to dream about it too. It was this weird dream where I was sitting in my bed and I thought hey I'm going to blow my brains out so I snuck in my parents room stole my dads gun and that's what I did and than I died. The sad thing is though I woke up and actually thought this was a good dream. Most people think dreaming about being billions heirs or having a hot guy/girl as a bf are good dreams. But apparently I don't think that way. I've been cutting more too and it hurts like hell but it helps me when I get overwhelmed I guess. It does it calms me in a way. I hate doing it though in the long run a bunch of ugly scars who wants that? *It just helps I don't know how but it really does. I've told all this being suicidal and self harming to my mom but I don't think she took me seriously. That's the funny thing about depression people don't ever take you seriously i mean if a guys crying saying he's scared and he wants to die they wont but if he's waving the gun to his head or actually blown his brains out people will be all like I wish he told me about it first. It's sickening. The annoying part is I already attempted suicide and ended up in a psych ward so you figure she would take it serious this time. Its weird I guess but I almost want to get sent away I want help and I want to get better I just want to feel safe and my house and family can't provide that. Not that there horrible people I love all of them to bits I'm just to much to handle right now I'm in a low point.,

On my part I've had a on-off depression for years and I guess the numb feelings just got too much for her. She's my soulmate, we have a son together 4 year old and I love them both profoundly, but I fear we will never be a family again. I've been overwhelmed with suicidal feelings lately and don't know how to cope with them. I'm on meds for the depression and seeing a psychologist but nothing helps with regards to the overwhelming wish to just end it now. Maybe I should mention that I had my first severe depression 20 years ago when my girlfriend in the teenage years died from cancer. Some of the problems from that time still haunt me I've discovered lately. What to do? I hope some of you can guide a lost soul. I don't see a path out of the darkness anymore.

From there on with those major things in my mind along with the litte F U's that my life has thrown my way keep me pretty depressed..I never let anyone help me, I was to afraid to let people in..Everyone I have trusted to date in my life has always turned around and shit on me..along with the fact that I hate to cause trouble..if I am a burden i just swell up..it makes me sad..I wont even say anything if i was ordering food..I would just take it and go, not wanting to cause trouble to the employees.That is one of the primary reasons i havent sought help before now..I just dont know what to do..Im failing at everything I do, college, my job, I have no real friends that I can talk to face to face. *sigh*..Im sorry to burden anyone..I havent slept nor eaten in 1.5 days and I just needed to get it off my head..",
584,"losing it Hi. Yesterday afternoon/evening I kind of flipped out... I was so very upset... I really wanted out... wanted to give up... wanted to just go away and never come back... and I was talking to some friends... and I told a friend this... and I asked her why?? why couldn't I just go away?? She made a list of people who would really miss me or something, Idk... it was so hard to hear what she was saying... I wasn't hearing words... But she named people who love me... *sigh* And she wouldn't get off the phone until I promised that she'd talk to me today... And I just wanted to be asleep... Wanted to go and take enough meds and knock myself out for awhile... from when I got home at 7... until I had to go to work the next day again... really I wanted to do something else... but... *sigh* but the med I took only worked to calm me down... some... I was so tense... very... + I'm still not sure I can handle this... I couldn't get to sleep... I tried having a drink... that didn't work, tho it calmed me down some too... + a little bit later... yeah... nothing got me to sleep really... calmed down - my friend helped, Idk. A good friend stayed on the phone w/ me until who knows what time... until I fell asleep, basically... and mind you, I woke up at what felt like 4 hrs later, which would be typical for me when I'm like this... around 5 or 5:15... 2? hrs early... I felt terrible... really bad SI feelings again... tried to go back to sleep... but no,... and it was too late to take another med... bc they work for about 4 hrs... so I came online... couldn't post yet... but I said hi to a friend... zombie like... Idk. until I could talk some... Idk.. and then an hour later I showered, and thought stories... could hear positive stories in my head... what friends would say... n I decided I had to post...

Twice in the past week, I've came home from drinking and tied a scarf around my neck really tight but not really taken it any further and it hasn't freaked me out at all.. I just kind of laugh at my pathetic attempts(?) and actions. Last night I had a dream my brother committed suicide, but I know it's me in my dreams and not really my brother, it's like I put my feelings on someone else...it finished with me waking and thinking I should text him and tell him if anything happens to me that he should take my diaries and never show them to my parents cos they'd be heartbroken if they read them... Yet, I'm not actively planning suicide...I can't see any point to life and I'm miserable, but I'm doing a convincing job of going about my normal life pretending everything's fine...I'm so confused as to whether I should be concerned about myself or not??? Maybe I'm just a wannabe attention seeker or something??? I really hate myself.",

I know that I'm not supposed to do that either, but it is getting harder and harder not to. I just want these feelings to go away :( I am so tired of feeling bad. The thoughts are becoming more and more intrusive in my mind. I just simply don't care anymore. If I had my choice I would choose death. I know that is wrong, only for my son's sake, other wise I wouldn't care. I am shaking and feeling worse by the minute.

594,"Is suicide always an option? Having suicide as an option will plague most of us for the rest of our natural life . . . it is always an option - BUT - we avoid it by thinking about those who would be left behind, somebody once said ""It takes more courage and strength to live than it does to die."" There are times, though rare, that suicide is not at the front of my mind but I'm always aware of it's existence. I've come very close a few times, just last week was the latest, but I never stop thinking about the shock that would be on my siblings face when they heard, or my Mom and the type of heartfelt pain that drugs can't soothe which she would spend the rest of her life living with, the hurting, questioning, wondering what she did wrong, self blame . . . and what about my nephews that love and respect me so much, I'm their idol - the person they hope to be like, I have to ask myself ""If I commit suicide then they will think it is okay for them to do it too."" I've always told my nephews (ages 10 - 21) they can be anything they want and do anything. Mostly, I don't allow them to speak or think ""I can't"" I quickly remind them they can. Original question: When does suicide become not an option? Answer: Never, it just moves down on the list of priority. Some days it will move back up but it will also move back down again unless you do give up . . . I hurt so bad and so much and that it plagues me throughout my whole life, but I would rather live with that as opposed to having my mom live like that, I'm the brave, courageous, person that my family calls when they don't get what they want - who would they call if I was gone?",

I am a burden to them, they dont need/want me they deserve better, better than me, they deserve love,happiness, they deserve to grow up happy, i shouldnt be here dragging them down. When my daughter leaves for school of a morning she kisses me and says I love u mum, but i know deep down thats not true. I have noone, noone whats so ever i can talk to.

596,"Triggers of suicidal thoughts controlling my life I've had a lot of problems with relationships lately. Three weeks ago my boyfriend of 6 months ended it saying he couldn't deal with my crazy anymore and since then I've been recklessly dating around, mostly jerks. I went on one amazing date and thought he was perfect and gentlemanly and he never called. I feel miserable about myself, unworthy of love. That's my worse fear and it has triggered thoughts of suicide. I often times sit and think of how much easier it would be to die. I've been driving fast without a seatbelt, agreeing to go to random guys apartments, and taking large (although not lethal) doses of xanax. I've tried to turn to friends and family for support but it scares most of them away and my mom is falling apart trying to deal with me.

599,"Sigh. Doubt anyone will read this, in fact I don't even know why I am posting this. Probably just because I don't want to finish it just yet and I am lonely. I guess I will just type my whole life story. At the age of 12 my best friend was killed in a car accident and my life since then has been a total disaster, hell, maybe it wasn't even because of that but that's what I always looked at it as. I turned into the worst person on earth, someone who didn't want to be loved, someone who couldn't. Throughout high school things got worse. I lost all of my close friends and to this day I only have two ""close"" friends. I never felt the confidence to try and get girls attention simply because I knew that nobody could love me. I honestly could type for hours about my days at high school and a fairy tale love story that ended and made me further not believe I could be loved. After high school I got into a really decent college and I guess the depression lessened a bit. But...the depression picked back up and I found myself skipping 90% of my classes and failed the winter semester. In the winter things got even more worse, just constant nagging by parents to do better and eventually fake promises I would make. Spring semester started and I actually started the same way I ended winter, terrible. But one day, I was online with some ""online friends"" when I met this girl named Ashley. Around February of this year we started talking and she is honestly the most perfect girl I have ever talked to. This would eventually die out because she lost interest in me, who wouldn't if they were talking to someone 2,000 miles away and someone who always talks about their feelings. I had many thoughts of suicide. That was until the day she told me she loved me and I loved her (love is very serious for me if you haven't noticed, she knew what she was saying when she said love). That happened about 20 days ago. Fast forward to last week she told me that another guy told her that he loved her and although she told me she didn't my heart was broken again. She told me she wanted me as a best friend. The past 7-10 days have been hell. She used to call me at 4:00 am (1:00 am for her) and talk to me for hours on end and I would love it. Now a days I have to ask if she wants to talk and although she says she has reasons why shes busy or whatever the case may be, it feels like shes lying to talk to the other guy. I honestly don't know what to do. I love her more than anything in the world and told her I will come to see her asap and it's like she doesn't care as much anymore. I was willing to give my life to her. Oh did I mention most likely I am kicked out of the college I got into? Yeah. I don't know what to do and honestly I constantly think about killing myself and as this drags on and on each day the thoughts become more real. Haven't made any plans yet, mainly because I don't wana try killing myself and still live. If anyone reads this whole thing I just want you to know that I love you and thanks.",
600,"What are your reasons to live? I'm looking for different perspectives, I guess. What are the reasons that you're living through each day in pain? What gives you hope?

601,"Dead already... just a walking corpse waiting to decompose. Well, another day off and I'm sitting here depressed and hopeless about my life right now and the future. That's all I experience anymore... I don't do much of anything anymore but force myself to wake up, work, eat, jerk off, and sleep. I wish I could just run away, but there's nowhere to go. I can't stay here and live much longer, this town is dead and most of the people suck... even the weather's fucking up; it used to be like LA and now it's more like Seattle. I have a dead-ass end job and I suck way too much at school (along with a long-ass laundry list of other things I suck at) to have college be a worthy investment. I keep looking outside reading about other places in the world and I have literally no hope for the future... everywhere I look it's just getting worse and worse and worse with no signs of letting up and nobody seems to give a fuck. What the fuck is this Jesus motherfucker doing? Supposedly he gives half a bloody shit about us? I don't see it... organized religion is just another example of this world being so fucked up (since it's birth) that we have to make up ridiculous ""reasons"" for living pointless lives that suck and condemning others who think differently or refuse to live said conformist lives to a place of eternal hurt, pain, and suffering. To me, god just seems like an average parent... whenever we fuck something up, god had nothin' to do with it! Must be that serpent tempting that guy selling reefer out in the parking lot again! However, if we succeed at something or make the world a slightly more livable place, he's out there just waiting to take all the credit. It must be a nice mentality for god to create itself into. I don't see the point in doing anything anymore. If the apocalypse came (how? shit, with how fucked this world is, take your pick) I'd be SOL and JWF because I don't have money to stock up on shelter, food, and supplies or know anybody who'd teach me survival skills (but since I'm not good at anything, I'd be dead anyways, so FUCK IT.) That doubled with this fucked economy means only rich ass (AT LEAST upper-middle class) white people and genetically strong/abilitied people would survive. Then again, who the fuck would wanna live in a fucked-up world where everyone's living like ""The Day After Tomorrow"" or ""Mad Max"" or ""Road Warrior"" or ""1984"" (ah fuck it, take yer pick) and are stuck living only on basic ""survival?"" A lot of people I guess... a lot of these gung-ho genetically lucky Alpha male types are acting like they're gonna survive the destruction of society and crush any weakling who gets in their way. Is it any wonder that most of the only people we have left are alpha male reptilian barbaric savages? I guess it's just another inevitability. Fuck it. I just want to take my very last vacation before the shit hits the fan somehow and get my will and suicide manifesto written and just fucking kill myself and be freed. THIS WILL HAPPEN. There is no reasoning me out of it. Even hell would be freer than this world, because at least Satan is an honest entity... there's no lying or confusion or deception with him. The love and trust in my heart is almost gone anyways... only a huge void of distrust, uncertainty and hatred is left. FUCK LIFE! FUCK THIS WORLD! FUCK EVERYTHING!

My mother survives off of disability checks – and drinks most of her money away. She is always sitting at the table walking to look at me with those deprived eyes. My grandfather died last month – I did not bother to attend his wake. I could only associate the man with booze and panhandling downtown during the Christmas season. I am a broken man. I have realized many failures. And the only thing I have ever wanted was a loving relationship. It was the one thing I would wish for every birthday. I live my life normally. I function as a normal human being. I have been around the block, a few times. A loveless life – just happens to be another thing I must “accept.” I am done.",
615,"nothingness I would rather be dead than alive. The only reason I stay alive is to not hurt my mom. If it wasn't for her I would have died a long time ago. She is the only person in the world. I don't have any true friends, no one. I have hobbies and I do things that keep me busy, but i don't get nothing out of it. I do things for no reason, i don't have any will, any hope, any faith. I'm feel ostracized, like a loser, a worthless piece of shit. i feel like scum. I hate being alive. I don't want to anymore.",
616,"If the doctors won't help you... What are you supposed to do? I've told them everything and they say there's nothing wrong with me. It's weird though because they have denied me treatments for other things because I have a ""history of mental health problems"" even though they've always said there's nothing wrong with me. If I have a history of mental health problems then why haven't they done anything about it? I don't get it. I told them I can't stop thinking about hurting others and I have hurt others for no reason, and I said about my urges to kill myself and cut my face. I don't want to do any of those things but I worry that I won't be able to control my urge to do something crazy for very much longer. Now it's on my permanent record that I've had mental health problems even though they've always said there's nothing wrong with me and have done next to nothing about it. Now all the doctors that see me will know that I am crazy and I will always be tarred with the mental health brush even though no-one ever did anything about it. If I could start again I would keep my mouth shut. Sometimes I think I should just give the NHS a wake-up call. They would deserve it for not doing anything about my mental health issues and for laughing about me, which I caught two of them doing once. But most of the time I don't want to hurt anyone except for myself. I don't know what to do any more. It took me years to build up the courage to tell the doctors because I thought they would lock me away for other people's safety. I was surprised to learn that they aren't actually bothered by such things. I need help but I can't go to the professionals. What do I do?",
617,"I just need someone to know... As the title implies, I've never told anyone what I'm going through. Not directly anyways. It just makes u feel a lot lonelier when u have no1 to go through it with. So here I go: the earliest suicidal thought I remember was when my-then-abusive nanny was hitting my bro. I think I was about 8 or younger. The nxt thing I felt suicidal again was when my gradma died. U see, my grandparents were the ones who raised me bcus of reasons beyond my parent's & grandparents' control. So I had a very close relationship with my grandma & her death was very hard for me. I was in a dream state for months. I blamed myself for a long time & I still do (even after several yrs). I somewhat feel that if I had done something, she'd still b alive & my life wouldn't be lyk crap. I now live with my parents & it's my mom who makes me feel suicidal the most. We nvr get along. She makes me feel lyk crap cus she calls me names & tells me that I'm dumb. Everytime she calls me names or hit me or compare me to other ppol I just hate myself more & think of suicide even more. The only reason I'm hanging on is bcus I'm afraid. I'm not really afraid to kill myself but I'm afraid of the afterlife. My grandparents raised me as a Christian and for us, suicide is a sin. Therefore, I would be condemned to hell. But what would be the difference of the hell in afterlife than the one I'm living now?? My only escape would only be university but it seems so far away....",
618,"Maybe I Brought This On Myself My undying misanthropy, my self-induced isolation that has been with me for 8 years, my inability to truly love or care about other human beings. My inability to accept the past and move on, my cold-hearted nature that destroys every relationship, my destructive, self destructive personality. My dreaming of death every day for 8 years, the inability to find anything that provides respite or catharsis. My wasting of all of my talents, the taking for granted of all my gifts, how I ruin them all with my nature My inability to function in any capacity, the way I cannot understand the purpose behind living, the way I view oblivion as preferable. My hatred of seeing people happy, the sickness I feel in my stomach upon the mere mention of ""love"", my hatred of seeing the same people who have wronged me time after time enjoying things I never can I really am a lost cause.",

621,"Listen Gotta think this shit out. Some peoole really are better off dead and I might be one of them. My skills are totally outdated, my eyesig5ht is so bad I can barely read the computer. I can't study, I havre tried. I have gigs and gigs of PDFs on the drive. It takes so damn long to read them. so today I tuirn 54. My eyesight is bad due to floaters, and not so good retinae. When I look at a white wall or pice of paper even I see all kinds of shit floating around. I'm told it can be fixed, but for a shitload of money. They actually inflatee your eye with Freon. I don't have fifteen grand to have thisd done and I cannot earn it like this. Catch 22. ] But I want to tell people to realy think about this before. You cvan always do it tomorrow. Your pain could subside. I am as stoic as possible. That is how I am. I was taught Men control their feelings, and act on intellect. Like Spock on Star Trek who saved the universe/world/planet/colony/whatever so many times by just keeping a clear head. That is how we were back when this country worked. I am within months of becoming totally indigent. I used to make so much fucking money I never even counted it. I never cared. I knew better than to save because I knew they were devaluing the currency. So it was a house. Well I finall took my beating on that just to stop the taxes on it. Now I have NOTHING. Not that this house defined my life, but it DID mean something yo me. The olman and me paid for that house for like 14 years. There were times when shit got tough that we made the choice to make the house payment instead of buy food. I dug som3e chicken out, and we found a coupl;e cans of Chinese veggies and water chestnuts and all that, and made chow mein. Or is that chop suey ? Gone now. the house is gone. To me, you cannot go back. I have been living, well existing with family for the last couple of years. It is killing me. I do not live n my own house. Maybe others do not understand this, but oh well. I am not doing this over a lost lover. This is not fucking bullshit here. Yes, this is not a spur of the moment thing. You all out there considering this, remember it is a one way street. My desire to do this is based on the fact the=at I have become useless. Or relatively so. Can't make money. I call that useless. But I am physically fucked up because of black mold, and my eyuesight is so bad that I would not really even want to ride a bicycle in traffic, or a motor bike. In the old days, people a;lways asked me to back up the truck or trailer whern I helped them move. Oh yeah, another reason was that I could lift and tote things. Them days are so over it is not funny. It is not funny. I am telling all you, this is serious. DO NOT DO IT. I am not, at least today., Remember ther eis always tomorrow, umm well, maybe not... I have very carefully considered my situation. some got what, their olady left them ? Lost their job ? (well that is kinda part of my problem) ?House caught fire ? (I had that happen, I had insurance and it was the best thing ever happened to the place) I got no kids, thank whatever. Maybe my sexual disfunctionality. Show me pussy, I do not respond. I only respond to certain things. I'm not Gay, but really could not call myself totally staright.",
622,Lonely Lately my loneliness has caused me to have suicidal thoughts. I do not want to die but I cannot stop thinking about suicide at least a few times a day. I don't have many friends to talk to & have been single for 3 years. I don't think I can take loneliness much longer,
623,"I want to end my life? So badly My life has fell to pieces recently. My Dad got cancer, I got rejected by a girl i love so so much, not only did I get rejected she just completely ignored me which is worse. But I was thinking to myself this morning, I still do boxing, thats my life, I live for this game, so maybe things arent so bad. So just to check this morning I rang the Amateur boxing association to see if boxing with bi polar disorder, which I have is ok. Im not allowed any fights. I cant even compete in sport. I have nothing left to live for. Boxing is all that has been on my mind for 5 years, now im not even allowed to compete. I so badly want to end my life. I dont feel like my brothers are giving me any support at all. If they were in my position I would go to any lenth to help them. Its as though im screaming for help and no one is even looking up?",
624,"Two fighters, my first call to a hotline and the grocery store....odd is it not? Two fighters, exactly the same. Same moves, height, weight, build, experience…in fact let us go a step further and say they are clones (moderators please calm yourselves, this is not a religious post by any means. Clone sounds like stem cel then becomes religious). So two fighters, one is cloned from the other. All characteristics are the same. How would this fight go? I suppose they would cancel each other out and die by beating themselves to death, perhaps it would be a never ending fight…..or…..another likely scenario is that they cannot fight at all. Throwing the same exact punches at each other at the same time. In our own life, we at times have to face the gravest of enemies….us….our own mind. Who can win if one is a clone of the other? One would think that no one can win, much like my example above. Others may think that thoughts of suicide occur during these times….both trying to self-destruct. What can you do? One usually wins and it is usually me, but the battle can be long (battle meaning episode) and taxing. Tonight I went to the exchange. It is a place (you all more than likely have something similar where you live). They sell new and used cd’s, video games, records, video game systems etc…you can buy or trade. I was feeling ok, not great. Traded in some no longer needed dvds and walked out with an Xbox 360, a hard drive for it, extra controller, some blu rays and a game for 100.00 out of pocket. As I was waiting for the transaction to complete, I started to feel anxious. A new anxious feeling I do not think I had had before. This one was vacant of most of the usual symptoms. As I got to the car I threw on my finger pulse ox and my heart rate is 113 and climbing. I do not drink nor smoke…nor do drugs other than my prescribed Xanax. I drove away and the world around me seemed out of control. It was at this point I needed to use the bathroom and of course there is none around. Perfect! I come to a grocery store…large grocery store chain and make my way to the bathroom. As I enter, the floor is white., bright white lights…everything in this public bathroom is white. For me when I am most anxious, lighting seems to add to my issues even more so with fluorescent lights as they had. For the first time in my life I decided to call a crisis line. I wondered how it would go and dialed anyway. It said press one if you are a veteran or calling for a veteran. I thought, ok I am calling for one and he is me. A woman answers the phone. My first thought…a woman? Do we discuss combat stress and if so, what would she know about it? She turned out to be very kind and also very informative. Most things she told me I knew but some I did not. All in all in was a good experience I hope to never have to repeat. Sometimes it is nice to know we are not alone.",
625,"fuck my shit life I’m a 32 year old guy who is pretty much dead-cert (excuse the pun) on killing myself, probably at the end of this week. Quite simply, I’ve had enough of everything and have spent my whole life depressed. My life is total shit. I grew up with a useless alcoholic father who was never there for me. He was such an arsehole I couldn’t even bring friends around our house because he was always drunk. Even now that he’s sober I can’t stand him. I think its primarily because of him that I've had anger issues. My mother is my rock, this is the only thing that stops me from killing myself. She’s always been there for me, always. I love her to bits and I know I’ll break her heart if I kill myself, but I’m in so much pain I feel like saying fuck it regardless. Selfish I know but my life is a living nightmare. On top of that I spent my life wishing I were female. I’m trapped in this male body with no way out. I confessed to my family when I was about 20 that I wanted to be female, shortly after I initially dropped out of university because I was abusing alcohol and drugs. Only my mother supported me, the rest of my family just told me to go see a shrink. Scared of being labelled a freak or rejected I stayed a guy. I went to the gym and started to lift weights to feel more comfortable but the truth is I have zero confidence. My whole life is a constant struggle with a social phobia, I’m totally shy and struggle to talk to strangers. As a result I struggled with relationships and ended up blowing thousands of pounds on prostitutes to fill the loneliness in my life. Spent most my life sat at home on the Internet or playing video games. My only passion I found in life was studying Japanese. It took me to living in Japan for 2 years but even then I struggled like hell. I spent most my money on prostitutes, only made a couple friends and spent most my time crying on the webcam to my mother about how shit my life is. I left Japan to come back to this crappy little island and couldn’t get a job with my language ability. Destined to a life of doing shitty jobs I never worked for 12 years, lived off my parents, have no idea how to do anything by myself and rarely went out. At the beginning of the year I met a woman that I fell madly in love with. She told me she loved me; she was the first person I ever met who made me feel good about myself. She was so charming and loving, totally amazing. For the first time in life I finally found happiness and I started to live and feel like a man. She became my life… but after 5 months she dumped me suddenly out of the blue for reasons I don’t know. I finally found a job, she tells me to move into her flat and I said yes, 5 days later she dumps me on the first day of my job, total mind fuck. Confused and traumatized I was bordering on insanity. She used to say to me ‘I’m only building you up for the next woman’, I thought she was joking at the time but the sudden dumping and some of the things she said to me convinced me she never loved me and she had simply been taking the piss to boost her ego. How can someone tell you they love you then dump you 24 hours later, it makes no sense. I bumped into her a couple times in public, insulted her because I was convinced she had just used me and she got the police involved. I have a harassment order on me now, so I can’t even talk to her. She never once said sorry for anything, always my fault. I loved her so much, adored her, she was my life, but now she’s gone and I’m totally dead inside. The first and only woman who’s ever told me she loved me and I sit here questioning whether it was a complete piss take or not. I’m a co dependant who can’t function on my own. I have a massive heart too, I’m empathic so the pain is beyond bearable. I’m writing this at work, a job I hate, I’m a lackey doing a job for morons. My bosses are talking across the room from me and nobody gives a fuck. I was even reading suicide forums at work early and nobody took any notice. I’m the coffee maker, the letter poster, nobody cares, I don’t even know why they bother employing me. I’m on medication, counselling. Nothing works. I’m totally dead inside and I’ve lost the will to live. My ex sold me a dream, marriage, kids, growing old together, a total dream. I fell for it and now its gone, now I have nothing. My reason for living has gone. I’m unwanted and uncared for. I don’t want anyone else, just her, but she can’t stand the sight of me. I can’t move on, I gave her my heart and soul and I’m lost without her. I’m not living, just existing and the pain is unbearable. I cry every day, I can’t even bring myself to smile or talk to people. We have a new guy at work this week, he’s really chatty and keeps talking to me, I just want him to go away and leave me alone. All my dreams and aspirations are gone, no desire to do anything. I was going to learn how to drive but I can’t even bring myself to do that now. Thank you for reading this but I hate my shit life and I want to call it a day. I'm scared but I just can't function anymore, I just want this pain to end. When I go to bed at night, I pray not to wake up, I don’t want to get out of bed, I don’t want to do anything, just sleep, sleep forever and disappear.",
626,"Dying to live I jacked in my chance at therapy months ago. Can't blame anyone else for that one. My grades have slipped from As/Bs' to shit. Just the tip of the ice berg. Feels like the end to be brutally honest. I don't look forward to the future - I don't want one. I don't know what hope is. God cannot give me any more chances. He/she got me into a good university, decent extracurriculars, even some help for my head. And I've blown it all. I don't deserve any more help from anybody. I see the signs - how my time is up. Odds which would have gone my way in the past never do anymore. People talk to me less. I'm being slowly phazed out. The killer is that even though I've deteriorated, I now know what I could have been capable of. It flashes through once in a while. I could have been a good student. I've even met someone I could have been proper friends with. I know the job I wanted. I now realize the hobbies I would have enjoyed. I see the life I would have had if only they had taken me to the doctors 11 years ago when I first lost it. Seeing who I would have been while not being him - it's too much to take. Never felt this emotion before - can't even fucking name it. Not just sadness. But it's too little too late. I can never be myself, I can't take anymore of being who I am. I've tried a compromise - but it's like being 2 people at the same time - can't keep it up for long. So the way I see it the shitty me has die one way or another. Gonna give therapy another try if allowed. But feels like it's too late. Nearly 23 years old. Used to have good grades. Had 1 or 2 real friends over the years. Had the occasional good time. By rights I should be dead anyway. I've not had the best of runs, but others have had worse. People fight wars, make real sacrifice. Their's no excuse for me not being me. Gonna end it one way or another. Shit, please don't pity me - I don't deserve it. And anyone else thinking of ending things - don't. Find that compromise - it's out there",

630,"Airline to Heaven There is no one as delusional as those living well day to day, insulated from the elements, no cold breeze blowing by forcing thought. I woke up this morning from a very emotional dream. I was crying my eyes out on someone's shoulders, while thinking about how I've done nothing with my life and how I don't have any more oppurtunities left to better my life (due to the economy, etc.), and said, ""I'm living for nothing."" It was actually a tragically sad dream. People always accuse me of crying for help in all the occassions where I am doing anything but crying for help. How odd. So here it is, this is my real cry for help. And being that I am already oh so familiar with the world I do not expect to get anything from anybody. I already know the way you think: ""What's in it for me?"" Yeah they drilled that into your heads from childhood on, didn't they? Nevermind what Jesus said: ""Other than this there is no greater Love, that a man lay down his life for his friend."" No but you don't like Jesus, see that's why you war with Him. He asks you to do things which you are nowhere near ready to understand that, on a logical level, have a higher purpose. People keep talking about George Orwell's 1984 and the New World Order reality we're all living in now. Well yeah I agree, and here's why, more specifically, here's how it's fucked my life. I keep going over and over in my head lately how did my life get so irrevocably fucked? Where did I go wrong, or was it even me who went wrong in the first place? I am actually balding now and I'm not even 30 years old; it started about two months ago. My hair is thinning and falling out apparently, do I have cancer, a thyroid problem? Who knows. You know, this is funny, with all of the reading which I had done on death and dying, none of it prepared me in the least for the actual article. What utter hypocricy. All the nice talk: ""Death is to be celebrated, it's a doorway, it isn't an ending it's just a transition."" While I still believe that all of that is true, it didn't help to ease my grieving over my brother's death in the least, oh yeah, probably because HE WAS MY ONLY FRIEND IN THIS WHOLE WORLD. At one time those amazingly deep revelations about death, now it just feels like small talk. I went sixty days straight without sleep just before he died. Well I had chronic primary insomnia from August 15th, 2006 - October 15th, 2006, and in the midst of trying to recover from that infirmary handicapping of my mind and soul, my brother died in the beginning of May of 2007. Two years later, in May of 2009, as I was just starting to recover from the psychosis-residue which the insomnia had left, and recover from the melancholy which my brother's death left, when my sister came out for a visit. I don't know what her and my fiancee talked about that night when my sister stayed over at the house I was renting then, but my life was destroyed even further after that night. Ever since that night my fiancee somehow got it into her head that I was going to hit her, even though I had never hit her before. I feel I can say with a fair assurance of certainty that my sister somehow talked her into thinking that I was a bad, violent, abuser of women. Nothing could be further from the truth. And when I think about it now it all seems so crystal clear, of course, that is to be expected from my psychotic sister, I had simply forgotten that fact, but what I wasn't ready for was the way in which how easily my fiancee bought her bullshit. From that night on she absolutely hated my guts. Amazing. We went from having a good relationship to a Godlessly awful one, and the only thing which seperated the condition of our relationship was that one night in May when my sister spent the night, and the two of them got drunk together while I put in my earplugs and went to sleep, as I had to go to college the following morning. So now I am back at my abusive mom's house, broke and unemployed (no unemployment check, no SSI, no welfare) going to Devry. This is just the drama from the last five years, I haven't even touched on the homeless period in my life from 1995-2005, or my parent's brutal divorce in 1986 and the custody battle throughout my childhood and the way that THAT fucked up our heads. The way I wasn't even allowed to have any friends, or the way I turned into a realtime solitary loner, a state that I still cannot shake off and how much has THAT royally fucked my world? Nope, I'm not even going to get into any of that from before the last five years. So, this is the reality that I must deal with and you're accusing me of being narcissistic and feeling sorry for myself? What the fuck would you know, seriously, what has happened in your life to where you could possibly relate with this shit? Anything at all? And you want to sit there and tell me I'm an asshole for talking about how my life got to its current sorry state? Do you really think that you're being helpful with that? Do you have even the faintest clue what it's like to be scapegoated for over twenty years straight, how frustrating it is after that much TIME? You can go to Hell and I mean that literally. If you can't relate then turn the page, I don't need your comfy diagnosis. I really don't. However, if you can relate then all of your input is more than welcome, I want to be clear about that. Where others wish that their lives were like a Shakespeare tragedy, somewhere along the line my life has really become one of, one drama after the next where I am, of course, ever so always framed to be the villain by the villians themselves. And I am really getting fucking tired of it. The last 100 places that I have applied at, and no I am not exaggerating, I have only gotten one interview, just one! Employers wont even tell me why they wont hire me, so I am forced to ponder my past and what might possibly come up in their computerized background checks. HELL, even the ARMY wont take me because of some bullshit LIES on my record from twelve years ago, but that topic is one for another forum. YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE THE TIME NOR WANT TO BELIEVE NOR WANT TO HEAR THAT STORY! At this point I am ready to join a monastery and just walk around barefoot and in a robe until I die of starvation. What is their left to do at this point? I mean, seriously, what is there left? I don't steal, I don't lie, I don't cheat, I don't flirt, I'm not aggressive with people who are not aggressive with me, I'm not looking to get laid by anyone, so why don't you please tell me WHAT MAKES ME SUCH A THREAT TO YOU AND TO EMPLOYERS? I am now going to Devry University with the hopes that $75,000 in student loans will somehow pay off down the line in my future, if I have a degree. I am sure that it wont of course, the economy is in Hell and is only sinking further in (and you know it), but I might as well have the degree before I check myself into the monastery for my safe place, some kind of a holy sanctuary space that affords the peace to live humbly or possibly die. Somewhere in the midst of all of that I hope you got some kind of picture of my life, so If you know of any fairly painless suicide methods please feel free to share. Thanks for taking the time to read this.",
631,"The pain is unbearable I have ruined my career. Well, I suppose there might be a chance that it isn't ruined but I'm pretty sure that it is. I'm not even sure if I should be posting here, because I'm not suicidal because of depression, but because my career is over because of mistakes I made. I am pretty sure I made the mistakes I did because I was depressed and I was diagnosed with depression, but I've never been entirely sure if I actually was depressed or if I was just inept at handling my life. At any rate, due to ruining my career I have reached the point where I have to kill myself. I am afraid to do it. Afraid it will hurt, and afraid that no one will take care of my dog. And I'm sad that there is no hope left because I so desperately wanted there to be hope. I had been so hopeless for so long and then things looked like they were turning around but then they didn't. I keep trying to tell myself to stay alive and just let things play out a little bit longer just to be sure the damage is irreparable, but the anxiety of getting through each day is causing me to require an immediate escape. I am just in so much pain. All the time. It never stops. My chest constantly hurts; I feel like I am walking around with a gaping chest wound. I feel like I can't breathe. Like everything is imploding. The holidays have made everything so much worse. All the facebook messages expressing hope for the new year, meanwhile all my hope is gone. All these normal people, with jobs and normal lives, celebrating. Juxtaposed to me. A total failure with nothing to hope for and nothing to celebrate. I don't understand how I managed to mess everything up so badly. I never wanted anything grandiose. Just a normal life. And for some reason, despite my best efforts, I just couldn't accomplish it.",
632,"I just don't know So I'm fairly sure I want to attempt suicide. I've been thinking about it for a few years now, and the more time goes on the more sure I become that it is the only option for me. I'm in a pretty unique situation in my life right now. Actually, I've been in a unique situation my whole life really. I'm what one would call a ""loner,"" but even calling myself that would be an understatement. Throughout elementary and middle school, I only had one friend who I later lost touch with (I homeschooled in high school). Now that I'm in college, I spend my days not talking to anyone. I'm in my graduating semester, and I can honestly say that I didn't make any friends in my entire college career. And, in all the classes I took, I never even had someone to talk to regularly. Everyone for the most part ignored me, and it makes me feel like there must be something horribly wrong with me for people to treat me that way. So you can see the main reason I want to attempt suicide. I have no friends (or even anyone to talk to), and that in turn gives me no confidence in myself. I would like to build social skills, but I really have no idea where to start. They're so negligible right now that I don't even think it is possible to gain them. Don't most people gain them when they're little kids? There's another reason why I want to attempt suicide as well. I had a boyfriend for 6 months (started dating him around this time last year) and he made me feel like things were looking up for once in my life. I never imagined that a guy would be interested in me, so the fact that he was gave me a major self-esteem boost. I thought, ""Wow, so there people out there who will give me a chance."" The thing is, though, our relationship turned sour quickly. He started losing interest in me, and I was at a loss for what to do when that started happening. Soon enough we agreed to break up, and I still have yet to get over him. I just...I see no hope for myself right now. I know that committing suicide would hurt my family (the main reason I'm not sure I could go through with it), yet I don't believe there are any other options. I imagine my life 30 years from now, and I imagine myself as a bitter, lonely woman (perhaps still living with my parents). It's not something I ever want to experience. Honestly, who would? Anyway I don't really know why I'm writing this, or even if it has any point. I'm just kind of at my breaking point right now, and I felt the need to write all of this out. Feel no need to comment, I just needed to vent.",

I started posting on sites like this when I was about 58. And guess what? I have been depressed and unhappy for eight years. But I kept hanging in there remembering the inspiring prediction that things would get better. All that has happened in those eight years is a heart attack, depression, being older and weaker, all kinds of new pains, failing eyesight, the extinction of my sex life, difficulty urinating and a body that is falling apart.",

I did expect him to be like me once, i care about everyone and to always give all of my time and energy to the people around me, but I realised that we are not all the same and I had to reassess things and learn to except it.

637,"sad a cone, a spiral; a circle of loss. people aren't real. they are one dimensional. i am afraid of them. massage therapy won't work. someone has to touch me. i am afraid of people. they're eyes tell me nothing. i do not understand what they mean. their words don't have meaning because i can't understand the feeling underneath them. i stay at home because i can't decode people. i am smart, very smart. i have smart things to say, been called ""brilliant"" before. i am also schizophrenic, i am ""a person living with schizophrenia."" i don't understand a lot. i can't make the leap from the human being in front of me, it's physical form, the fact that it's separate from me, i can't assimilate it into my reality. i don't know why. i don't know why people are so foreign to me. i don't know why since i am a person too. i am not comforted by people. they look weird, and i can't decode them. i am not stupid. but i feel like such a weirdo because i can't figure out what people are trying to tell me. do they want something? what? are they mad at me? and do i deserve their anger? or do i not deserve their anger? should i apologize, or should i just write them off as a bitch and forget it? i don't know. i never know. i never know if i'm being over sensitive, or if i am justified. as a person living with schizophrenia, invalidation is a daily occurrence. it makes trying to figure out what's real and what isn't that much harder. because of the symptom of over-sensitivity, and the tendency to take on blame, i am a target for The Ruthless, for miserable people who are looking for somebody to fuck with. I know I am an easy target. they come in droves from all over. ""Look! Somebody to beat up!"" i feel used. i feel abused. i feel victimized because i have been. the therapist asked me, ""what do you want someone to do?"" like somehow my despair is my fault. like i did something wrong. like it's not her responsiblity to help me. it gets put back on me. i'm compromised. i have schizophrenia. on a good day, maybe i can think straight, but lately, with the stress of the 5 autoimmune disease i have, sanity hasn't been a part of my program. she's asking someone who doesn't know what day it is; she's asking someone who is completely overwhelmed and shell shocked. i am overwhelmed. overwhelmed. i can't do this. i can't walk this path, my life, anymore. i had figured out a way to cope with the schizophrenia, with the incest, with the poverty, and was tentatively taking baby steps into life, into living. and then those illnesses hit. i don't know what to do. the schizo symptoms make it impossible for me to cope with these disease. i can't focus to do the little job i fashioned for myself. and that brings me shame. i can't do this massage, because i am literally terrified of other people. eating is an issue. i never did notice hunger, and it took hours to coordinate the idea of ""being hungry"" with getting the food in my mouth, chewing it, swallowing, and feeling full. a diet plan? a nutrition plan? it took decades to figure out how to eat the potatoe chips and ice cream. changing things around? not hopeful that i could mess with this already precarious balance i've got going. i am overwhelmed. bottom line: the schizo symptoms make it impossible for me to deal with the autoimmune disorders. i feel helpless to make use of the help i am getting. i don't know how to explain this to my doctor. most people do not understand schizophrenia, and they accuse of my not trying hard enough, of making it up, of procrastinating, etc. These schizo symptoms are real and dibilitating. the pain is horrible. the back pain, the belly pain, the leg pain. the constant diarrhea. i don't want to eat because it forces me to stay hours in the bathroom afterwards. if i have an appointment out, i have to plan to eat at least 2 hours before, so that i have enough time for the bathroom program. i am depressed over how my life turned out. i am sad that my dad raped me. i am sad that he wrecked my trust in others. i am sad that i can't relate to other people. i am sad that my sister hates me for not making her feel good, for not being able to relate to her in a way she needed. i am sad that my mother used me all those years; sad that she didn't love me. i am sad that",

639,"I'm a loser, plain and simple. When I was a kid, I thought I had a hard time connecting and getting along with people it was because I had some weird depression or S.A.D. but now I realize it was all because I'm a fucking loser who's not good anything or at least be popular with people. When people laugh around me it's not because me being funny, but more of being laughed at, call it a self-discriminatory humor. It's not even that I want to be some hot shot popular football jock who gets straight A's and chicks all the time. No, I just want a normal life like everyone else. Joke around.. have good times etc. At least I could've been a nerd.. that way there's something I'm good at. I've always been that nice guy, girls would like to be friends with me not to fuck me or anything. I'm actually a good looking guy apparently, so ladies would be interested in me initially, but as soon as they find out I'm a spineless whiny loser, they lose their interest. This has happened so many times and it kills me. (Actually they sense it even before I talk) I AM the bottom of the social ladder, girls asked me to move in with them, was surprised, but didn't take me long to figure out that it was because of how 'non-sexual' I am. And ladies, in case you are not aware, that's like one of the worst insult you could make to a guy. I have no talent at anything, I barely manage to break even with earnings. I don't even know what to do in my life. I have no social skills and I just can't keep up a conversation. My 'friends' are all nice to me on the surface, but I was shocked to find out that they diss me behind my back of how much of a loser I am. Not ALL of my friends as some genuinely care for me and should something happen to them I'll go to hell to help them, but majority are assholes. When Im at parties I'm that guy who's in corner that doesn't exist. And I'm very afraid that I might just end up like my father who's a whiny loser who managed to accomplish nothing all in his life and he's only there because my grandfather left him with fortunes. All this was bearable until... when I was hit with degenerative neuromuscular disease. The doctors know there's something definitely wrong, but can't figure out the cause and obviously no realistic cure. (Also, could be fatal). At least when I was a kid I used to do a lot of sports, but nowadays there are time that my body gets so stiff that I can't go anywhere without a car. I still remember coming back from the hospital where I was diagnosed with the disease, my mother was doing her best not to cry, but there were tears coming out and it was the worst day of my life. Thousands of thoughts went through my head. "" The **** have I done in my life to deserve this? why the heck I can't be like everyone else, get into decent relationships, or at least sleep around like my buddies do why the **** can't I exercise or go around like other people do why can't I pursue my dream of becoming a soccer player? why can't I have a normal life? WWWHHHHHYYYYY"" I just have no motivation to live. The only thing that's stopping me from killing myself is my mother.",

They're probably gonna be surprised, but not sad, no. I've written hundreds of suicide notes. I've found papers from somewhere around age 8 that just further convince me I don't want to deal with this anymore. I'll just type it for you: I don't like being sad I don't know why I am. A lot of my friends are happy. Why can't I be? I don't like it. (Can't tell what it says right here). I think the world would be better if I was gone. If mom and dad never had me, I think the world would be better. I don't like this. It's sad and I'm scared. I wish I wasn't born because I think my whole family would be better if I wasn't. I'm bad, and I don't know why I'm here. Usually I'd burn the drafts to make sure no one found them. I tried to kill myself three times, but none worked (obviously). My parents never found out.

I can't just forget the flashbacks and nightmares I have everytime I go to sleep.

So that is my message to all of you who are struggling today. She reminded me that sometimes it is enough just to put all that crap aside and just to live in the moment.

660,"What to do? I have been on a downward spiral for a while now. I'm 26 and have lost all ambition with life. I don't have any goals in life, nor ambition or motivation to do anything. I know no one really cares to read someones life story so I'll try to keep it short in explaining how I got to my current situation. In High School I suffered minor depression, nothing big just a little sad now and then. After I graduated I just knew I wanted to go into acting but after a few months going to school I realized I didn't have the passion to pursue it. I got slightly more depressed not knowing what to do with my life. I decided to join the Navy and that helped for a while but after about 3 years, I realized I had no desire to continue with that life and when my contract ended I left. I moved in with my Mom for a while then moved off on my own to go to school. College was great for a while, I thought I knew what I wanted and was working hard to get it. 4.0 GPA for my first year. I have struggled with belief in God over the years as even in High School I didn't understand how such a being could exist. Well during my second year at college this switched from a hard time believing to a no way I can believe knowing what I do about the world and the way it works. I don't rule out the possibility of a possible diety-like-being having started everything but I could no longer believe in the well wishing abrahamic God. Well this is when major depression started creeping in. I couldn't see the point in life or why to even continue on with anything. I stopped going to classes etc. and had a pretty rough semester. Over the holidays all I felt was that I was disappointing my family and my own potential and vowed to reclaim my self this past spring. Well when I went back the depression got worse I stopped talking to friends. I even stopped bathing for days on end. Due to my self induced isolation, I was able to live like this for weeks at at a time as long as I called home and lied about how things were going and made an appearance every few weeks with friends people assumed everything was ok. I would stay in my room for days only leaving to go to the front door and eat food I would have delivered. I was living off my GI bill which was meant for college while not going to classes or doing anything but watching TV, reading or playing video games. I finally admitted some of what I had been doing to my mom and she insisted I go see a psychologist. I did but I didn't tell them everything. I was prescribed Zoloft and acted like everything was better and left again. This entire past summer I have spent living in my own filth, barely bathing and over eating beause I couldn't see the point of doing anything. It seems like nothing matters. My GI Bill ran out this summer so I could no longer afford rent and couldn't force myself to get a job. I moved back home a couple weeks ago and have been trying to become a usefull part of society again. I shower everyday and have been keeping care of myself but only because I don't want to upset my Mom. For the past Week and a half I have been back home and I still have yet to get a job though I was able to force myself to apply so maybe I will hear back from some of them. Essentially right now I'm 26, about 20,000 in debt living at home with no job and no ambition or motivation to do anything. I am really considering becoming homeless or commiting suicide. I really don't want to do either, only because I know how much it would upset my mother, but I can't continue to be a drain on her and I don't know how to get motivated enough to get a job and keep it. It is hard enough just to make myself get out of bed every morning. Anyway that was a lot longer than I intended. Anyway if anyone has any thoughts I would love to hear someone elses opinion.",

662,"If not now, when? My story begins 16 years ago when I was 8. The first time I tried to kill myself. My mom walked in and caught me. I spent two weeks in inpatient care. This attempt stemmed from my sister's attitude towards me. My biological 'father', her step dad, sexually molested her for years before my mom caught him. My sister has blamed me for this ever since. She treated me horribly and I took all the blame and guilt for her. When I was in high school, I began harming myself after my girlfriend broke up with me. She was not interested in leaving my hometown, and I was leaving for the army in a few months. After she broke up with me, I started drinking and smoking weed. I quit caring about everything. My GPA plummeted, and I barely graduated. I spent years trying to get back together with her. The week after graduation I was on a plane for basic training and AIT. After finishing training I went to airborne school. I tore my MCL after landing wrong. I landed wrong after being released from the 250' tower. I didn't finish the training, the first failure of my adult life. Soon after I was able to leave the base, I received orders for Fort Stewart. I got there and took leave. I went home and met my first wife. We started a relationship shortly after. I returned to Stewart and got on a plane for Iraq a week later. While there, I did have a couple of incidents that have seriously scarred me. Not long after I returned from the Middle East I proposed to her. We were married 6 months later. I requested a transfer to a base in Kansas to be close to her family. Shortly after we moved in together, we found out she was pregnant. About five months into the pregnancy, we found out that our baby had alobar holoproenchepaly, which is a deadly condition where the skull fills with spinal fluid and the brain does not have room to grow. She passed during birth. We had her cremated. We actively tried to get pregnant again. After over a year of trying, I went to get tested. I found out that I was sterile. When I confronted her, she admitted to the baby not being mine, and all of her infidelities. Evidently while we were living in separate states, she had a boyfriend while we were engaged. And every time she went home while we were married she partied and cheated on me. She admitted to all of this. I told her to leave the same day, after three years of marriage and almost five total years in a relationship. Not long after she left, I got drunk and attempted suicide again. I was on the phone with my best friend when I attempted. I don't remember any of this, as I was blackout drunk. About seven months after she left, I met the woman that was living with my neighbor. She is completely amazing. She has two kids, ages 11 and 13. I fell in love with her, when she was only supposed to be a one night stand. She had had a troubled 13 year marriage and was pretty messed up. My 'white knight' syndrome kicked in and I began to persue her to fix her. After a couple of months I realized just how much I do love her. We spent seven incredible months together. I never even like and kid until I met hers, and I completely fell in love with them too. This woman was my everything. She was the most incredible woman I have ever met. She is 32, I am 24, and the kids are 11 and 13. But I pushed her away. I don't have a clue why. And now here I sit. All I want is to leave this earth. I keep thinking about a quote I heard in a movie. ""I long for death, but fear it."" I am not religious by any means, but I am afraid there is an afterlife and I will miss it by committing suicide. I am scared. I have only drank twice since our break up, because I am afraid that I will do something stupid. I am too scared to kill myself sober, and I know that if I get drunk chances are I won't wake up. I have been diagnosed with severe anxiety, depression, and insomnia. I quit seeing my psychiatrist because the medicine she prescribed didn't work. I haven't talked to my family in years. Thank you for reading. It feels good to get this off of my chest, and I have no one else to turn to.",
663,"I really can't go on anymore Everything is going wrong for me at the moment I've got caught smoking at college, im probably going to fail at my GCSE's because my maths is quite bad, my brother left our house last night; told us that he has nothing to live for and he might jump into the river, he said something really hurtful to my mum last night. The arguments at home and seeing my brother hurt my mum after all that she has done for me and him tears me apart, the day before it happened I came really close to suicide. I had it all planned out, where to get the things to do it with, when to do it. This isn't just because of my brother, my life is fucked up in lots of other ways, I feel as though if I die I will be happy. I am seriously thinking about doing this, it seems like the only option. What do I do??",
664,"How do I start I guess my problems started in high school, one of my friends had died of leukemia in my second to last year of primary/elementary, back in preschool my friend died of a allergic reaction to a bee-sting. I am dyslexic, so it wasn't easy getting an education or fitting in, and didn't make friends easy, other children bullied me when I was in primary. Several years later. In my last year before high school I lost my friends, basically fell out with them, save my best friend. When I started high school I knew no one, and I was still upset from the above, and the class took advantage of this, and accused me of being gay. Eventually it got to the point I was sick of them hassling me, so I said yes, in the hope they would just leave me alone. For the first two years the girls in the class all swore at me, told me to f*off, and everyone treated me like shit. I wasn't homosexual, but their hate and nastiness made me question my sexuality at University (I am now bisexual and go for both sexes). I tried to cope, but I got bullied all up to the second to last year of high school, when I managed to get a good group of friends. I also joined online games to try and cope, and get my mind off how hard things were, but it was never really enough. I spent every second or third day crying when I got home from school. It didn't help that my parents had high expectations, and I ended up with a English teacher that hated me, and didn't help me at all, the school refused my request to change class, so my English grades went from E (A) to M (C) and N (F). I later half-failed English, and had to retake it in my last year. But the bulling in the first two years had done their bit, and I couldn't manage to pull up the courage to go out with my friends to places, or join clubs or anything. I just avoided interaction with people, save in class or at lunch hour, even though I have friends, I find excuses to go, and even sleep in, and find myself incapable of meeting up with them. In my second to last year of high school I rang up the youth hot-line, and tried to tell them my problems, but the hot-line just rang the police, rather than talk to me. I wanted to leave home at that point because I couldn't cope with my parents, or my life. I went back home, and my father just yelled at me, and my mother just ignored my problems, when I told her I was depressed she just ignored me. I never asked for help again, and tried to pretend it never happened because my parents had a controlling influence on my life, my father threatened to beat me if I 'made my mother upset' on the day I rang the hot-line. They are incredibly judgmental and closed minded, if I tried to even speak to them, they would just ignore me, or call me stupid, or a brat. I guess my parents ruled me through fear and discipline rather than love or respect (they hit me or removed privileges for months), they still treat me like a child, rather than an adult. I am still a little scared to stand up to them. I just buried myself in work, and hoped my struggles would go away, but even when I got to university they still didn't. I had to retake a test, in order to get into University because I had got so depressed and couldn't concentrate enough to study. I tried to find a class I would like, but I got emotional periods when I couldn't concentrate (in a good mood I could get an A to A-, but in a bad mood I would just barely pass or fail), and failed courses. I am still eight classes from getting a BA ($5-6K is what it would cost to complete). Now I am to the point I can't go back to university because I am $10k in debt, and fear that if I try and get re-admitted I wouldn't be able to cope just like last time. My parents just hassle me over skype, or threaten to ring the police, and they make me even more depressed especially when they argue or complain about me not being at university, their friends are even worse. I ate comfort foods, and my health isn't always great either, as I can't find the will to exercise, its only my genetics that keeps me from getting too bad (as I don't put on weight or get cholesterol problems). It doesn't help that I recently quit my job, and am going to have to go on a benefit, if I find work again, then I will still have my problems. Almost every day is a struggle, I try to sleep, read or watch a movie or something, just so I can keep living, and write in my spare time. Basically my entire future hinges on either getting a better job, or getting a book published. That's my story, I still have suicidal thoughts, but most of the time I try to keep happy by talking on Internet forums, or writing (just so my mind stays rational so I don't try and hurt myself). But if I end up in a bad job (or am stuck on a benefit for too long), and my life gets worse, not sure what I will do. If I went and saw someone (or talked to my parents) it would likely get worse, especially if my parents ever found out about what I feel right now.",

667,"Don't follow me! Have you ever loved someone so much u couldn't leave them? You couldn't live without them? Well, I know alot of people who feel that way, but theres a person I know who feels that way for me, and I feel the same for her. Like it or not. You see I used to be depressed all the time, but I never let anyone know. People would always tell me when I was laughing that they couldn't help but laugh too, and stuff like that, but on the inside I was sad , and suicide was my plan to get out. I had done all my homework and was ready to do it, but before I did I had to ask her what she would do if I passed away, with out telling her my plan. She told me she would die with me, Straight up kill her self, because without me all her happiness would be gone, and she was serious. From then on I tired everything I could to be happy again. Days turned into weeks and so on, until I finally got medicated and it ended up working. Then I found out she tried exactly what I was going to do, in a way. I understood why she did it, she has alot of things to deal with and it really cuts into her life, but it didn't mean that she had to cut into her wrists. She didn't cut deep enough to bleed out but the scabs were still there. When I first started to bring my self out of my depression after what she told me I wished I'd never met her. I loved her so much, but the pain of living wasn't worth it, I wanted to die, and I wanted her to live on with out me. I wasn't afraid of death or being dead, I was ready, but now I'm afraid of all that, suicide or not. If she would of given me a diffrent answer I wouldn't be this way, and now I don't even think I could live on with out her. I feel like the blind leading the blind. I know she won't really try to kill her self unless I died, she sees a future with me thats worth waiting for, but I want her to be able to see a future with out me in it if that day comes.",

669,"I'm Scared Blackroses, I'm really glad to hear you are doing a bit better now. I wanted to ask what you are doing long-term to take care of yourself. Sometimes instability and suicidal thoughts can be helped by medication or therapy or lifestyle changes and that way you can learn ways to cope before you end up in a bad situation. Saying this cuz it's easier to think about self-care when not in a crisis situation, but afterwards when you are feeling stronger. :)",
670,"Getting worse.... If this medication, since it is the last ditch effort is unsuccessful, I have decided to take my own life as I will not live this miserable way the rest of my life. It is very scary to me because there is nothing else left to try if this does not work and I refuse to keep going since my medical condition is getting much much worse. I do not think that is mentally ill to have that plan. Fact of the matter is that I have not been me for years or all my life because of this disorder so it is time.",
671,"biological mess Let me start off by saying that I'm suicidal right now. The only thing preventing me from killing myself is a general dullness that stops me from seeking a tall enough building to jump off, or a surefire method that can be done at home where I won't fail to complete. My dad got diagnosed with a particularly bad case of multiple sclerosis when I was 5, and died slowly, in our house, stuck full of tubes, covered in bedsores, almost totally paralyzed. I was the one who discovered that he had stopped breathing. I was 10 when he died. My grandmother (dad's mom) abused me emotionally and often forced me to share a bed with her, grasping me tightly, shaking me while crying, sometimes touching my ass. A year after my dad died, my mother decided we were going to immigrate to America, where I was the chubby, ugly brown guy who got rejected by everybody. I can't play sports. I can't even watch them. I can't talk to girls, because apparently everything I say comes out weird. Every friend I ever made is now a drug dealer or addict. My new stepfamily is wealthy and beautiful, and make me feel like shit. They have no desire to fill the ""void"" left in me. So all I've got is my retarded mom who doesn't understand why I care what stepfamily thinks of me (she lost her dad in a horrific plane crash at 8) I had a bad case of phimosis (foreskin that won't retract) and a doctor made a mess of my penis through a botched circumcision I have giant, puffy nipples and perky man breasts (funny, i know) I'm 23, and I've got a big bald spot in the back of my head... and last time I shaved my head to avoid being ""balding"", I got reactions of ""Yuck"", ""Cancer Kid"", ""Alien head"". I have uncorrected brachycephaly, a condition that leaves your head rather flat at the back and protruded at the top. I'm a highly valued business analyst, my boss and coworkers love me, but I am so sick of not being touched, not being held, not being approached by girls, and just being held at arm's length. I need to be valued for more than my economic contributions. I feel like on the chart of human evolution, I'm one of the apes, but I happened to get a 2200 SAT, and then dropped out of college because all the girls hated me. Why should I live?",
672,"I wish I could start all over... I've been in a very bad mood lately. Nothing seems to work, whatever I attempt to start. People, that call themselves special and close in my life let me down over and over again. I woke up with suicidal thoughts, I haven't had that in a while. I wish I could just scratch everybody I know out of my life, change my name, close my social media, pack up my bags and move to a new place...But I don't know if that would be a solution. May be the problem is within? Also decisions that I can't make, make me sick...and there is nowhere and nobody I can ask for an advice. It's my cousin's wedding next week on the other side of the world. Originally I was going to go for 3 weeks, so I could also accomplish something there for myself. When I imagined to be there for 3 weeks with my narcissist mom and toxic aunt, I opted out. Plus I didn't want to spend a fortune. My cousin keeps asking if I come. Yesterday I found a cheap ticket, going there only for a week. And now in doubt again. I asked my mom over the phone what she thinks, her response was silence and then she said ""I don't know"". I got so frustrated, I said I had another line and hung up. We grew up together, I can't say we were friends up to a certain age, but I don't have another family. On the other hand I am sick and tired of bending backwards for other people when I am not sure they will even stay in my life for good. I don't want to take responsibility for this decision and I don't know how to deal with it.",

674,"You Always Leave Me So I made two best friends on Tumblr over the summer. One in May, the other in July. The May friend and I would talk every day, all day. Literally from the AM to the AM. She was so much fun to talk to that I would skip business events just to stay home and talk to her. It's amazing because I don't usually talk to people that much. I'm often on the fence about dealing with people in the first place. Eventually, the May friend spent less and less time on the website. By the end of June, we were running out of things to talk about, plus she was answering my PMs less often or not at all. Eventually, I had a huge relapse and started venting on my blog, which was typically used for motivational pictures and quotes. Then the July friend showed up because she was concerned about me. We talked, and she turned out to be an awesome friend. We spent the hours together and so on. Our friendship lasted longer than the May friend. However, that friendship is dying, too. Because she also has depression, which apparently got worse in September. Now she just leaves whenever she has a problem with it, which is pretty much every day. I am so fucking sick of the few good people I meet walking out on me. I have an urge to just kill myself.",

That ended last Sunday. Because of this illness, I have missed 3 days of work. Because of those days missed, I now have 2 more occurances. We are only allowed so many for the year. And even while I was sick, even while I was on those antibiotics, I drank. I was too sick to work yesterday, but I drank. And I as I sat in my apartment, coughing, and gagging, and drinking, and blowing my nose, and trying in vain to find a doctor that would see me, I realized how terribly alone I felt. I know...I live in the world of my creation. I am alone because of my screwups.

However, in the shitty moments I feel as if I want to do something. Perhaps, suicide? Kind of like an ""I'll show them for doing that to me."" I am in the 10th grade and so is he and we go to a rather privileged public High School. I am usually at my best when I am at home on my computer or in my room by myself. It's a kind of peaceful sanctuary for me. I am also part of an online gaming community where I spend most of my time. The best part is none of them know who I am, therefore, I cannot be judged. I am also rather shy in public and on my computer I am a complete polar opposite. I'm very talkative and well known. I generally feel welcome and good there. However, I've recently been spending as much time as possible in my room. My parents do not like it and have taken to yelling at me and are quickly angered Back to in school where most of my problems originate. I was lucky to get into a lunch group early on in the year with people generally more popular than I. At first, I didn't talk much just listened and laughed. Then a couple of months later I suddenly became more comfortable with them and took part in many of their conversations. I was even invited to hang out with them! However, I ended up not going because I was hanging out with my friends who I've had since the third grade. Needless to say I was never invited anywhere with them again. However, we still go to lunch together everyday. However, more recently I told some apparent ""secrets"" to 1 or 2 people in the same place as I was hanging out with them. They had already said these ""secrets"" out loud a bunch of times in front of a lot of people. One person asked the person who was talking about these ""secrets"" if they were actually true and that they heard them from me. I didn't know of this until the next day when I met my lunch group and some of them straight ignored me. I found out later when we were sitting at a table when she burst out yelling at me telling me that I would be ""eating lunch alone if I kept telling people shit"". Ever since then I haven't really been the same around them. I rarely speak to them yet I sit next to them 5 days a week. I try to talk to them, but I just feel awkward and that I shouldn't be there. Sometimes, I feel like they eat with my out of pitty considering our difference in popularity and I really don't talk to them outside of lunch anymore. Sometimes, I simply dread going to lunch with them and generally seeing them. It is often brought up how I told other people their business. But, to be honest I can't blame them. And Im not even sure what to think of them. Anyways, there is more to this story but, I tried not to go into massive detail considering this is already quite long.

What I'm saying is, there are still some things I've gotta do before I leave this planet. I've set dates before and on both occasions took massive overdoses. But this method I'm using will be fool proof. So if the test provides no future therapy, and I then get the book published then that is that, I'm gone.

I know that I cannot take a nerve pill because I will run out before the script is due. Why can't people understand that the brain is an organ. If someone breaks their leg, they cast it. The brain can ""break"" too.... but why is it that people are labeled ""crazy"" when something is not right with the brain? The only reason that I can type this is because I took a couple of oxycodone that I had in the drawer - I read here all the time but cannot even get what it takes to type anything. I cannot stand it when the sun comes up - I am thankful when it gets dark so that I can go to bed. Half the time I'm not sleeping - but my dark bedroom is my refuge. I'm not writing this for pity - I literally have no one to talk to.",
685,"I Wanted To Share This On another forum I frequent that deals more with suicide issues, I am the guy that starts the daily threads, like we have here in the banter forum. Last night I was thinking that it might be easier for me with a bottle of vodka and my device. Here's what I posted over at that site; I hope it can provide some comfort for those of you who need it; Hey everyone! Well it's another Wednesday here at ...... A lot of things being shared on the board this day, like others. I have half a thought last night that I was going to be putting up a post in the part of ... that makes ..., ie THE suicide forum. But then someone very important to me, reminded me that I don't have to carry the weight of the world on my shoulders. I don't always have to be strong. So that is my message to all of you who are struggling today. She reminded me that sometimes it is enough just to put all that crap aside and just to live in the moment. Fuck all that stuff that is bringing us down. And whatever you do, don't project. I found myself doing that last night. Projecting only leads one down the path to the dark side, as Yoda might say. As one of my best friends used to tell me, DONT SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF!!! So let's gather together friends and try and to fight back to sanity!!!! And remember, I love you all!",
686,"What is the point anymore..... I feel that I am the unluckiest individual on the face of the planet. I have several chronic conditions and I seem to have more and more problems each day. I have a new problem now where I feel that my skin is burning. Could be a reaction to the Tramadol could not be. I stopped the med and still have the symptoms of burning. I was taking it for Sleep Related Eating Disorder in which I eat in my sleep while sleepwalking. Now I have had to stop the med I am back to the behaviors in the night. This is the only med that has worked in ten years I have had this disorder and it is taken away from me due to a rare side effect of this medication from which I still have the side effect despite not taking it. I became unemployed because of this medication to get mentally healthy and now I am back to square one after working on myself for the last four months. I cannot deal with life anymore. I have no resiliency left....what a waste of my life....I get closer to ending it each day now to the point where I have ideas of it, picturing etc. Why can't my family have disowned me it would be a lot easier to go through with it. I am so depressed.",
687,"The United States is a sick place. The country I live in is literally so disgusting. For thousands of years humans lived on the Earth with little harm to the Earth. Modern-day slavery Right now, as I am speaking, my existence is thriving on the slavery of hundreds to thousands of human beings. I haven't met any of the people who have made ALL of the things I own. Some of these things were made in ""economic free zones"" where the US has built sweatshop factories in so-called developing countries in Central America . These free zones allow the U.S. to ship in raw materials (such a cotton) and hire local residents to assemble products for extremely LOW salaries. ($2-3/day) and then ship the good back OUT of the country, with no taxes, tariffs, trade barriers at all. Futhermore the U.S. removes income tax from these extremely poor peoples salaries, under the premise that it pays these taxes back to the country's government, however it doesn't even actually pay it back. Furthermore, the U.S. has also basically stolen most of the fertile land in many countries, which prevents local residents from existing by farming their own food. So we have huge monoculture farms with extremely hazardous conditions such as pesticides, chemical fertilizers which are known to cause bodily harm, birth defects, etc. Local residents end up working on these farms for also very low salaries, just so they can buy the extremely cheap imported U.S. subsidized GMO food to eat. these people live paycheck to paycheck and are basically slaves to the U.S. these COUNTRIES are basically U.S. owned slave countries. there is something seriously SICK about the way the world is operating right now. people are completely ignorant to it all and will only believe fox news and CNN. Even the food that most people in U.S. eat is poisoned with GMO's, pesticides, chemical fertilizers, steroids, hormones, all of these things are carcinogens which directly are known to cause cancer. you know what else is a carcinogen? most chemotherapy drugs. oh wait lets not forget the fact that everyone in the U.S. drives cars and exists by burning fossil fuels and coal. even though we have wind and solar technology we are all too stupid to stop buying gas for our cars to instead start using this technology in our homes and are contributing to a huge climate disaster that most people don't even believe is happening. now we are even using extreme methods to get this precious oil which is destroying the land, such as fracking, refining tar sands oils, etc. what about that fact that the country is founded on genocide? and yet we pretend that never happened, we literally have a day off of work to CELEBRATE the sick sociopath Christopher Columbus who literally tortured, enslaved, raped, killed, and burned alive peaceful indians who gave him anything he asked for. muckrackers who try to share information for free and make the world a better place are convicted and sentenced to prison. (Aaron Swartz) or people who uncover crimes of the U.S. government are being hunted down (Edward Snowden, Julian Assange) there is a never ending list of things that are just extremely fucked up. a person cannot even just live on a farm and grow food wihtout getting evicted for non-payment of taxes or raided for a ""drug bust"" . i really just cannot forsee a way of life that would actually be satisfying or worth going through that would be legal for me to even do here. i could try moving out of the U.S. but i honestly have no idea where i would even go as first i would have to get a job for a corporation working 40/hrs a week to have 20% of my salary stolen by the U.S. government for taxes. i owe 100,000+ in student loans and honestly, the world is just SO fucked up it is hard to even give a shit about this place. i am trying to care. but what is the point. the more i learn about the world, the more i think it would be a better place if humans were just wiped off the face of the earth in another flood.",

690,"The only thing keeping me going is knowing I can end it! I never thought I'd ever feel this way. I'm so so lonely, there is nothing at all right with my life and everything wrong. I am 52 years of age and have had no happiness to speak of. I have thought about doing myself in for a long time but I am (or was) a Christian and the thought of hell after this hell is crap. But just knowing that I can do it at anytime is the only thing that gets me through the day. Sounds like a strange thing for a 52 year old to be thinking of. People usually associate suicide with youngsters, but believe me older people can feel just as bad. I live alone and have very very few friends, not ones who want to hear how bad I feel anyway!! My mum passed away 2005 and I have never gotten over that. I don't have a job because of mental and physical health problems. My beautiful beloved cat passed away August of last year and I am still grieving so much for her, I want her back so much I can't even tell you how stupid that sounds as I say it, as I know that's not possible!!! I couldn't give a stuff about material things but I am so lacking in love and affection from anyone. I feel unworthy, hopeless, helpless and that I shouldn't be here anyway. I went to drs, told him how I felt but he couldn't have cared less!!!! I'm supposed to be seing a counsellor, but he keeps cancelling the appointments!!! I mean seriously what can I do? Anyway, the thought that if I have the courage, I can end this terrible suffering, actually keeps me going. I certainly am NOT going to spend the next 20 or whatever years, being this way, my brain feels like it's fried and my body has gone through hell with the tension and anxiety. Thanks for reading (if you have), it's good to kinda get if off my chest. Unforgiven xxx",
691,"Solutions Didn't quite know where to put this post, so I'll put it here to avoid triggering in the depression forum or whatnot. I've lived with depression for at least 2/3 of my life, and grew up with abuse. First suicide attempt at 11, and it was a conscious desire to die. (As opposed to a conscious request for help.) I know a thing or two about depression management. I've been on an antidepressant since my mid-20s (should have been earlier, but there were abuse issues regarding school provided therapy in childhood). The antidepressant keeps the physical expression of my depression in check, and oils the gears in my head so I better address issues that pop up, so to speak. My depression is currently preying on a series of unfortunate events regarding employment. (Depression, of course, hits everything, but if I analyze what's really triggering it -- this is the big thing.) Generally, if I'm in a low spot regarding my lack of employment, I do something else. I go to school. I volunteer (though I laugh at how so many career folks talk about volunteering as if it is easy to find it). I'm well educated. I do well in school, I have a bachelor's, a vocational cert, and am completing a master's. I work well with others. I have a boyfriend. I know a lot of people, and have a lot of friends, although depression makes it feel otherwise. Thing is, the series of unfortunate events has caught up to me over the years, and I'm running out of options where I can affect it. The whole thing is years long, and kind of Job-ian. At this point, I'm convinced that I will always be unable to find gainful employment (paid or not), that I am only good for gainful employment because I am female and thus a sexual object, and that no additional schoolwork will improve matters, and that the only thing I'm good for is being a student because I can only pay people to have me work for them. This is the sort of stuff where you're supposed to buck up and say -- feh! I will keep tossing out resumes, I will keep dealing with people who stare at my breasts and want ""help around midnight"" *cough* so maybe I'll find the one employer who's not looking for sex, I'll keep doing stuff, and eventually the situation will improve. It hasn't for over 7 years (when I graduated with my bachelor's). And now, in the middle of the master's, the degree which promised that it could get me at least an unpaid internship and then the current [economic] depression hit... I just can't do it anymore. It isn't getting better. I schoolwork for the additional degree is actually pretty poor, and I hate being beholden to it. The additional degree isn't going to help me become employed. There is something at work here that isn't the depression I've battled for most of my life -- whenever I search for, and grab, a new hold in my life's path, something blocks it as a dead end with incredible reasons. </end my headspace> Career folks tell me I'm doing everything right. Therapists tell me to lie to prospective employers (make up anything if you're not getting anywhere as it is). No one has offered me any criticism or advice other than ""you are employable, keep sending things out"", so I don't know of anything in particular I need to do to be more employable. And employment, to me, is an external validation -- I actually like working, and doing a good job is great!.... if I'm allowed to try in the first place. So living without steady employment, for me, is living without an external validation that no hobby or loved one seems to fill. When you are solution minded and faced with a situation that your actions seem to have very little effect on, and it drags on for years, it is very, very difficult to not take the final solution. And I always tell myself that suicide is exactly that -- me, searching for a solution. And it is a solution, and it is a very poor one if I were in better mental health, thus it is a very poor one period. But at the same time, oh, I would like a solution. I do hope that anyone reading this is doing better than I am at the moment, Plaid",

I'm just waiting for someone to confirm those things. No, wait, they already have by not acknowledging my existence. Plus, since I'm a guy, I often have to make the first move. I try it and it ends up doing no good. What's the point in going on if this is all I have to look forward to? I could disappear and no one would notice. That's how much of a non factor I am.

I cant even get a girlfriend because girls think I'm embarassing and pathetic. People mess with my cousins and when I look out for them my cousins call me a punk. My grandmother goes to the hospital for a sickness on alot of occassions. I always get good grades in school but the kids dont like that.

704,"What about the GOOD my suicide could do? The ""shiny-brights"" who carry on about how it will get better always tell us that the death of a person by suicide hurts those who love him. They constantly tell us that suicide is an egotistical and self-centered act. Has anyone ever considered the GOOD that could come out of my death? Right now, I am suffering from Peyronie's disease (it is an embarassing condition of the penis, look it up in Wikipedia). This is NOT a joke and I am not a troll! If you think my situation is funny then you are one of the people I will be delighted to leave when I leave this world. I have a same-sex spouse of 35 years (we are legally married as of 5 years). I do not like him touching me or seeing me with my condition. Our sex life has become almost non-existent (mind you, with men our age it was diminishing anyhow, but now it has become increasingly rare because of my deformity.) Here are some GOOD things that would result from my Catching the Bus: My spouse is 6 years younger than I am. Does he not have a right to a sex life? If I were out of the way he could find someone else. My spouse would inherit our homes, our cars, my funds, the survivor's benefit on my pension. He would be set financially. I am in my 60s and my life, health and even my mind will only go downhill from here. I will become a bigger and bigger burden every year on my spouse and my family members. My depression and my life-long fear and anxiety that torture my every waking moment (and some of my dreams) have not responded to medication, psychiatry, psychologists or whatever in several decades of trying. Do you seriously believe I will suddenly turn into a normal, happy person in the declining years of my life? Death would put an end to it all. I am pretty much (99%) certain there is no God or afterlife, but if there is one and he sends me to Hell for killing myself, then he is a monster and a tyrant and there is nothing I can do about it. But I am pretty damned sure there is no God. Okay, maybe it is an egotistical act in the sense that I am thinking of myself and relieving my suffering. Well, I read about a guy who left his wife and their adult children at 60 and joined a missionary society, became a priest, and moved off to Africa. He rarely if ever sees his family. He might as well be dead where they are concerned, and yet nobody calls him an egotist, do they? I had a friend who moved to another city. I was sad to lose him but I did not call him self-centered and egotistical for leaving, did I? Besides, if someone says: ""I want you to stay alive and go on suffering, because if you kill yourself I will feel bad,"" are they not being egotistical as well? I have to go on with this hell so THEY will not feel bad? Who is the real egotist here? And whose life is it anyhow?",
705,"Horrible life So I got really super drunk a couple of nights ago and I caused my family a huge scare because I was close to the point of alcohol poisoning. I dont remember half of what I said or did, but I know I said some horrible things about my mom and made her cry. When they finally found the alcohol, it was almost completely gone (mind you I had 2 bottles. one with whiskey and the other vodka) and they thought I was going to need to got to the hospital. I'm so ashamed at what I did. I just wanted to drink my problems away because I hate my life and I just caused more problems. I'm horrible and stupid and the messed up thing is, I would be willing to do it again if I got as depressed as I did that night. Now my sister hates me, my parents think I'm stupid and my friend does too. I want to just die of shame. I dont deserve to live anymore because I'm a failure at life and I've ashamed myself to the point where I think I might kill myself. I dont want to, but it seems like the only way cus my parents said that If I cant put my act together in 30 days, then they are kicking me out of the house.

I've been told (on forums like these and my doctor; I don't really talk to people) to look at the good things, look at my accomplishments, but that doesn't help. I always see some way I've fucked whatever it is up, some way it could've been better. Minor failures feel like catastrophes to me. Even very small things, like misspelling words. I do that on here sometimes, and in my head all I hear is ""dumbass, moron, idiot. No one likes a dumbass, no one will ever like you!"" I tell myself that's not true, I try to fight the thoughts, but it doesn't help. When people say ""you're not a loser"" I know its just them being nice. I am. The only ""friends"" I have are my drug dealers, except for two people, who I haven't even talked to in over a month. Never had a girlfriend, never asked someone out either. I just know they'd say no, and even if we did go out it wouldn't last long, because I'm a loser. People say not to put myself down, but putting myself down actually helps. When I honestly try to tell myself that I'm smart I instantly get hit with every little mistake I've made, when I try to tell myself I'm not ugly I see my huge crooked nose and greasy curly hair. This sounds like I only focus on the bad things, but I don't. I just can't see how the good things could possibly outweigh the bad things. I am just such a loser. I'll spend days just laying in my bed, wallowing in self-pity. I hate myself for that, too. My problems are so insignificant, so fucking tiny, and yet I feel like shit all the time. I'm weak, I'm pathetic. Then there's the memories. I'm pathetic for that too. I saw a couple people get shot, that shouldn't hurt me that bad. People go through way worse shit than me, I should be fine. But I'm not... haha I'm crying again. Even more pathetic. I just... I keep seeing the boy, little boy, crying,watching his mom dying, drowning in her blood, then his head caving in like hitting a pumpkin with a hammer. And that man sticking the gun in his mouth... Idk... reading over that sounds bad... that may not make me pathetic, but the other stuff does. I just... I don't know... I'm never good enough, nothing I ever do is good enough. Even if it is by other people's standards, it's not by mine. And you might say ""well don't have such high standards"" but if I do that then I'm admitting that I'm a failure, admitting that I'm not good enough, that I could be better but I'm not. Idk... I'm probably not explaining this very well. I don't know. I just don't know. Should I tell my therapist I'm suicidal?

713,"Contemplating I had racing thoughts so i wrote them down in notepad. Someone please help me. I have been admitted for attempting before and I cant spend that much time in the hospital. I will lose my job and that is pretty much the only distraction I have left. Quote: Well I dont know if this is truley good bye. Maybe its time I finally rid everyone of my troubles. Everything just sucks now and I have a feeling its onyl going to get worse. I really miss how my life used to be. I miss Sami and Katie. I miss them soo bad, I just wish that I could turn back time and just live those years over and over again. But I am afraid that will never be an option. I have lived the last few years in pain and suffering with these mental issues that I have been cursed with. Sure going to the hospital sorted things out and the medications helped. And for a brief moment in time my life was decent again. But things arent so decent now. I havent taken medications in a long time now because I have a job and now the government wants me to pay $50 just for a snobby doctor to tell me I can take something that has already been proven to work. And then I have to pay another $200 just to actually get them. Its ridicoulous. I am being forced to suffer. and on top of that I have tons of bills and fines to take care of not to mention being called a criminal because I continued to receive cash assistance when I was working. Not like i needed the money or anything (sarcasm). I am so sick of how this life works. Nobody truley has a concern for my well being except for my mom. Everyone else acts like they care, maybe even does care for a small period of time. But once the real me comes out they cant tolerate it. Take my sister for example. I would do anything for her, but yet when I get emotional, even though she knows I cant control it, she turns her back to me and acts as though I can help it. It makes me think if she would actually do anything for me. My friends, oh man my friends. I have had so many good times with them, they were there for me when I lost my two best friends. But no matter what I do, or how hard I try they just dont seem to include me. Sure when I ask them to think of me like asking if they want to do something then sure they will and it will be awesome. But I just cant help thinking where they would be if I never aksed. Would they ask me? I truthfully have tested it and they dont. Especially now that I am off my meds, they really dont bother with me anymore and it really hurts me. I spent nights crying my eyes out just thinking of how my life has chnaged for the worst and none of my friends are there for me. Heck im crying right now because there is a pattern and apparently I just cant keep any friends for a long period of time. I used to be happy till everything changed. I have an addiction to eating that I just cant help and its hurting my body and appearance so bad. I just want to be skinny again. Maybe then people would accept me and maybe I would be able to have fun without looking at my reflection and getting upset. Or being self consious that the close I am wearing dont fit right. I used to be able to go to any clothing store and just get any small size shirt that looked cool. Now I have to try it on and maybe 1 out of 10 shirts are actually dark enouhg to not show my disgusting body throuhg the shirt. I just cant take being this size anymore. I cant go to the gym because its too much of an inconvienance and I never ha ve time or energy to go for walks. And when I do work out I get light headed and I feel like i will pass out so i cant work out for very long. Everyone used to talk about how they could see the bones in my face and it looked un healthy. Well at least I was haoppy then. Now those same people make comments like ""Wow you got big"" or ""You gained weight since I saw you"". How do they think its a good idea to say that to me? It really hurts and because im such i nice person i dotn want to make them feel bad so i just chuckle and make it seem funny. But its not funny and its not okay, im not okay.

Since then I've had enough coping mechanisms and just the general self trust back to know I won't harm myself. The thing is that I can't get them to stop. In a good week I maybe only think of it once or twice but if I get anxious it all flies through my head non stop. I think it used to give me a feeling of peace and made me calm down to know I always had a plan B even if I had no intention of using it. Problem is that after my mom just recently died I really realized I could never intentionally put the people I love through that. Now when I get anxious I get so many suicidal thoughts which just scare me and upset me more and get me more anxious.

I lost myself when I was with him. I was a completely different person. I didn't want to be that devoted person. I wanted to be my OWN person. Then whenever I see couples I just want to choke and die. It's so painful to see couples all happy and crap. I wanted to use a knife I wanted to cry, but I couldn't.

734,"Reaching a breaking point with no relief First, a little about myself. I'm 23, I have a bachelor's in psychology, plenty of administrative experience through volunteering, I'm unemployed (the less-than-minimum-wage job for a month doesn't count), and I have no more things I enjoy other than drinking. Now, I've had major depression and a dysthymic disorder since I was, oh, around 13 or so. It comes in waves, I'll feel really bad, then fine, then really bad, etc. For the past 9 months, I haven't had a ""fine"" moment, just crippling depression. There were times throughout college that I almost broke into tears for no reason and had to leave a class. Now that I've been unemployed for over 7 months, I'm being forced to go back to school. For what? I have no idea, I can't handle any more school. My girlfriend tries to act like my doctor, which if anyone has had someone do that, it's more frustrating than research from scratch. I've had people tell me to ""get over it"", ""just do something, you'll feel better"", ""College will help you get better"", ""think happy thoughts"" (if you think that you can do this with major depression, you know nothing of it), and my personal favorite, ""it's not as bad as you think"". I've looked up many suicide options, and I actually have access to plenty. I can't do any because I'm monitored, which is making me more depressed. I'm not allowed to do things that used to make me happy (now only get me to a baseline mood), and I've been drinking a lot more lately. To be honest, I have no idea why I'm posting here, I have no expectations of anyone helping really. Still, it makes it seem like I'm following that ""fantastic advice"" from people who wouldn't know depression if they had it.",
735,"Do I have a chance of surviving, will suicide always be the main thought in my head? Since I was a child, I was taught that females must do everything for the males. Growing up to my father drinking everyday, to come home to beat my mother, to then beat us. When he was not drunk, he would make us pick out a weapon that he would hit us with. I guess that somehow it clicked into my older brothers head that it was ok to do the same thing to us. From 6 to 13 yrs old, I was sexually abused by my older siblings, which is my brother and sister. There has also been numerous times where family relatives have groped me, and touched me in inappropriate places. My mother would come home to tell us all the things she had done with her boyfriend, that includes sexual content. I was a 5th grader when she would tell my sister and I this. You see, my parents were always separating and getting back together. I always liked them apart, since it was much easier for us. They expected us to have the house spotless, their laundry done, and food ready and served for them to eat. Apparently we were useless at doing anything right. Guess my parents loved having 4 children, more slaves for them. During High School my older brother tried to molest me again, I shrugged it off. Both my parents remarried, and were dedicated to their new lives. My father lived close, but his wife wanted him to stay away from us, so he did. My mother married a man who we knew nothing about. Both their new spouses were very young, very rude to us. I always maintained high grades, so for that I received a scholarship to a private school. It was nothing to me, since a child I knew that my brothers would get the attention no matter what they did. So I completely tuned out what was happening in my life at the moment. In High School I started to experiment with drugs. I even tried to grow some in my room. It also came to me that I was not interested in men, that when I saw a woman, I couldn't help but be attracted to her. That's when I knew I was a lesbian. When my sister and I were kicked out of the house, I was in my 2nd year of HS. MY mother claimed that we were trying to steal her husband from her. My father didn't care to hear what we had to say, he just let his wife close the door on us. So my sister and I lived on our own. When my mother decided to let us back in the house a year later, I concentrated on not letting anyone take advantage of me in any way. My mother was about to have a baby, and my father had already had his. When my mother had her child, I completely changed, I knew it wasn't the baby's fault. I started noticing the way they treated the baby, I knew then that I would have to take care of her right. At this point I had lost my scholarship due to drugs. I was attending a public school, which I dropped out of. So instead of school, I took care of my sister. I finally felt that it was time for me to let everyone know about my sexual orientation. I was not allowed to touch my little sister, then few days later I was kicked out. My aunt took me in. It is there that I found out that my father had another child who was 5, his new wife was his longtime mistress. My mother and her husband are addicted to gambling, so they took me back in to take care of the child while they went out. The baby grew, they became more irresponsible. Now I argue with them to take responsibility, and be real parents to the child. I keep trying to prove my point that she needs the love of her mother and father to have a good life. I don't want her to have a life like mine. I finished an alternative program and received my HS Diploma. I stopped using drugs the year after I started. I am 18 years old. I wanted to work and go to college, with no money I can't do the schooling. With the economy so bad I can't find a job. All my siblings have been helped out by relatives in receiving a job, well paid jobs. No one has offered me some help. I asked if I could receive it, turns out I'm a big joke to my relatives, I deserve nothing. My siblings receive help with cars, cellphones, getting taught how to drive. None have took the time out to teach me to drive, or buy me a car, I don't even own a phone. My mother gave me until March of 2009 to pack all my things and leave her home. A home where my siblings still live in. I turn 19 in the month of March, I can't join the military due to my eczema. My question is why? What is it that I did that I am seen as nothing? Why do things just get worse and worse? I have been depressed for so long, haven't told anyone because it will never matter to them. Lately I have been contemplating suicide, and many ways of doing it. I would of done it tonight, but decided to seek advice on my situation. Can you please give me a rational thought as into why this is happening? Why do I feel like killing myself?",
736,Feeling bad I absolutly hate feeling bad...and yet I find myself here again. I have no idea what has caused me to feel this way right now at this very moment. I guess that I like it better when I at least know why I am feeling bad. I could chalk it up to just one of those bad days but I think that there is more to it than that. I just wish that I understood my moods a little bit better than I do. Is it weird to think of suicide just because? Because I am....,
737,"Honestly, the emotional pain I feel seems worse than any physical pain. I feel empty. Lonely. Insane from prolonged loneliness. I just talk to myself all day. I don't even notice or find it weird anymore. I've stopped reaching out to family members; they havd no idea how to help. The one person that could would be inappropriate to reach out to. Plus, I'd probably overwhelm them with my intense desire to not exist. I feel pain when I'm awake. I don't enjoy the taste of food. I don't enjoy a cold beer. I don't enjoy anything. All I've been doing lately is browsing suicide articles and posting/reading forums hoping for a miracle. Unfortunately, I've come to the conclusion that some people are just lucky and others are just born to suffer.",
738,"lifeless...worthless Three weeks into the Fall semester and I am feeling more suicidal than ever. I just don’t feel the way I used to. I don’t give a fuck about school anymore, I don’t see the point in even trying…and that goes for everything. Everything has been a failure, literally everything, and I don’t see any point in life anymore, in nothing, I just want to be dead, instead of living in solitude where nobody gives a fuck about you, where everyone despises, you, where nobody likes you, the anger, the resentment, the feeling of utter worthlessness. I am not scared anymore of what would happen if I killed myself, and I mean if there is an afterlife, I feel like killing myself is an ok thing to do. Things will only get worse not better. I failed in every way, I am not even human, I am beneath humanity. I don’t care about the things I used to like, such as reading, music, exercising, all of that is dead to me now. I am feeling depressed and dead without even being able to cry or to feel any emotion, thanks Lexapro. This has been going on for too long now. I am not worth it, I am not worth anything, everyone is better than me, everyone has more to offer than me, I feel like I am cursed, seriously, I am cursed. Everything that happens in my life is negative. I am tired. I give up on the world and on people, and on myself as ever trying to become a person, an inhabitant of this world.",
739,"the paradox involved in truly dying my dad raped me while my mom watched, so i swore i would never trust another human being again. at age 38, a therapist convinced me to trust him. i began to talk about my pain, about the abuses i'd been through. this therapist became uncomfortable; he got overwhelmed by the pain in my story. he decided he needed a break. he told me he needed a vacation from me. this was the first person i trusted since i was 3 years old. his walking away from me affected me. i felt and feel like i am a leper. i feel like i am a bad seed, that i am somehow intrinsically bad. i sometimes think i am poisonous. i sometimes am unable to eat from depression. i sit and cry and starte at the wall. i am up every night crying. i feel like the world has rejected me. i was angry before, and i was indignant. but i can't kill myself; it is, after all, my choice to continue to subject myself to the insensitive people around me. i could always kill myself. i am cursed, however, with an incredibly strong survival spirit. i hate it. it causes me so much more pain to hang around here on earth. i wish i didn't have this figting drive in me. it really is pointless to have it; i am going now where and i know it, others have confirmed it, yet i still fight. when i say i am going nowhere, i mean that i have a lot of health problems that involve complications that are fatal. my death is real; the prognosis for death is high. maybe that's why i can't commit suicide; because i know on some level that death is already near. i think that people who sense death is near become suddenly calm and complacent. there isn't anything to do by the time death gets up that close. i feel calm. i feel accepting of death. i plan on living. but i know that death is near.",

745,"I think I'm finally giving up? Hello, I found this website while googling quick and easy ways of offing myself (which is rarely a quick and painless feat it seems) and I decided to write something, hoping somebody will give me some insight. I have been depressed for as long as I can remember. Until recent years I didn't notice it to be SOMETHING, rather only as part of my personality. I'm a quiet and shy person so it's not abnormal for me to withdraw from the universe and hide myself away. I come from a not-so-traditional traditional Chinese home (meaning the only traditional part of this is my mother) where academic excellence and everything we (the kids) pursue must be met with utter success. Ironically, I'm not successful. In fact I'm more or less of an utter failure. I didn't make it into a good school, and I didn't even finish out of the school I did manage to get into. When I left home to attend this university some 2,500 miles away, my depression spiraled out of control and I stopped attending classes. All of this led to my attempted suicide in 2010. Very much regret I didn't succeed. I do a couple of things barely worth noting, and that is I cook very well (more of a restaurant level) because cooking is my passion. I'd hate to sound like an incoherent idiot but I forgot I took the meds my doctor prescribed about five minutes ago so bear with me, I'm doing my best. I have a therapist whom I see biweekly. My main issue is my inability to sociallize so we delved deeper! It seems my lack of self identity is a huge factor in my current struggles in social circles or lack thereof. Because of this, I have no support group of my peers for me to discuss my depression with. My family, I feel trapped and dead when I'm at home with them, but being away since I'm not financially independent makes it rather difficult (I am hunting vigorously for a job so that I can become financially independent). My parents never fail to remind me I am living off their money and that I'd better be doing what they say. Alternately, I had also better stop ""hanging a cloud"" over them regarding my depression, etc. I took that as a hint to not ask them for help snymore because it's an emotional burden to them so I try my best to hide it again. I am nobody. They ask me this a lot, you think you're someone? I think to myself, no, I'm no one. Thennnn all of this led to the thought that since I am nobody, nobody will miss me when I'm gone. I wouldn't even miss myself. I am just a useless nobody. Now why am I like this? There is a guy friend of mine that has been devoted and loving yet I'm afraid to let him closer to me. I'm fat, so they say, I'm obviously ugly if I'm fat? Why would he be interested or attracted to me? So I withdraw from men too (potential boyfriends). Most of my life I've been put down, shot down, yelled at, never good enough. Oh you did THIS? WELL WHY DIDNT YOU DO THAT like I told you. Did you go to school? Yes classes were hard. Why do you have to be so damn lazy? Why aren't you helping around the house? Never good enough. This is how I see myself: ugly fat smart but lazy and rather incompetent by proxy 23 year old girl with no future no boyfriend and no hopes or dreams left in this little head.I want to scream for help but nobody can hear me or I might get in trouble again? I sit instead in the bathroom screaming over and over into the towel on my lap. I want to just say help me, help me I don't want to die but I can't live like this so help me please! And nobody hears because it's all in my head. I'm trying not to hang a cloud over my parents, who are financially responsible for my entire life. Who else do I cry for help to? If I try and fail it will come back to my parents, back to the cloud, back to a failure. So I'm sitting here decided how best to make a clean break from this life. Am I crazy? Is it all in my head? I'm so depressed and nobody sees, or how dare you hang that over us like a cloud? All I want to say is help me. P.s. This post most likely made very little sense but I tried very hard. Please excuse any incoherencies or terrible terrible grammar. Thank you for listening.",

747,"Tangible Reasons for Depression Okay, this is a huge vent, but as you guys know it helps to talk about it. I realize that some of these things may seem stupid to you guys but please just respect my feelings. It feels good to get it out. I've been depressed off and on my whole life, a few weeks here a few weeks there, and sometimes complete happiness for a few months. So I realize that there may be something wrong with ME inside, but whenever I get down I always think of these things to justify the sadness, it seems. Here we go. - $100k in student loans, and a degree in a public service field that pays $20k/year right now and $30k/year possibly in a year. Doesn't get much beyond that. Payments are $915/month right now, interest rate is INSANE is the main reason. Hopefully I can consolidate and get it down... I don't know... they're sharks and I'm so fucked unless I really bring in the dough it seems. - I resent the way I grew up. I wasn't abused but I was pretty neglected. I know this may sound okay to others who had it worse but here is my story: Parents divorced when I was very young, never really cared about it too much because it was all I had known. My dad has his own depression problems and can't be emotional and he's manipulative and a money hoarder. He made 70k/year when I was in college so I was ineligible for pretty much every federal aid, because they expected him to pay for some of my schooling (really most of it) and he gave me nothing! Nothing! The last 4 months of my senior year he paid for my rent because I had almost nothing left, and an intense internship so I couldn't get a job. Anyway, growing up, I did my own laundry and cooking from the time I was about 10. Of course sometimes he would cook but not that often. I ate cherry pie filling for dinner with my sister, I ate buttered noodles, I ate a bag of doritos (off brand), or a bowl of pudding (like the whole package almost), or a few hot dogs (no buns), or some peanut butter from the jar, etc. Basically my dad came home, bitched us out for not cleaning, and fell asleep on the couch till the next morning. I had to pull many all-nighters in high school to get my homework done and clean the house so I wouldn't get yelled at. Even though HE was the one making the mess and not picking things up. And we weren't allowed to be in anything extra-curricular because he didn't want to drive us to anything or pay any money. I missed out on a LOT. We also lived in the middle of nowhere in a school district that spread very far, most of my friends were at least 30 minutes away, so I barely saw anyone outside of school. I had friends at school but I feel I really missed out on those deep friendships and enriching experiences of being in clubs, etc. I'm so pissed about that even today... it set me up for so many bad and lazy habits. We were allowed to come home from school, eat/drink anything we wanted only if my dad didn't have to cook it, and sit in our rooms watching tv until we fell asleep. No homework help, no support, no love. We weren't even a family. And I hate that. I know a girl who I'm so jealous of ... her family is so loving. Her parents are intelligent and funny and affectionate. They went on vacations together, they had family get-togethers that were fun, they went camping together, etc. At her wedding, she had cousins there that she was actually friends with (I don't really know any of my family) and aunts and uncles, etc.... I wanted to die at her wedding. Everything was perfect for her. She had to take out very few loans because her parents schooled on her on how to properly pay for college and helped her w/scholarships etc. She was able to get a bunch because of good grades (parents' support and assistance with classwork) and she had a lot of sports and volunteer work. Oh I'm crying just thinking about it cont.",

To all of those who have supported me during these last 41 months, thank you. You know my story. You know that I came forward on my own and confessed to bribery and filing false tax returns. I just could not live with myself anylonger when I went forward in July 2005. Here we are in December 2008 and my sentencing date (after being adjourned 5 times) is set for this next Thursday in New York. I will travel from Germany to New York to see what happens. For those of you who know me, you know my story of being in jail when I was 10 and having been brutally raped for 3-4 nights. Well here I stand 38 years later facing the possibility of going back. My lawyer remains optimistic in that she said that I came forward on my own and confessed to what I did and that I was not caught. I cooperated all of this time with authorities on both sides of the ocean. We will see on Thursday. Question is at this point - I just don't know if I have the strength or the courage to go through this whole thing or not. I have been going through counselling for a long time now and it has helped, but now I just do not know anymore. I wish I could just erase so many parts of my life and that they would just go away.

Too bad I didn't get the chance to tell him that I think about killing myself every minute of the day. Oh wait..I pretty much did tell him that and he didn't even seem to care!!! He asked if I had ever attempted suicide and I said yes. I was kinda shady on the details because it was years ago..but I told him that I think about suicide all the time. Maybe he didn't take it seriously. Or maybe I am just fucked up. He said that I had no reason to feel bad or to have such low self esteem..pointing out all the ""great things"" I am doing..the usual crap. God..I don't know what to do.

763,"Damned if I do...Damned if I don't... First of all I'd like to say that I've read posts on here and that a lot of you have great things to say regarding this subject. Thank you for your thoughts, as I can see them definitely helping some people out there. I've been battling major depression for at least 10 years now, maybe longer. And though I can see the value of what some of you have to say, I have a hard time applying it to my specific situation. I realize I would be hurting people by choosing to remove myself from this planet. One thing that I'm trying to make sense of though, is when I should stop caring. These same people I would be affecting have played a large role in why I feel the way I feel. I seem to be a complete failure, no matter what I attempt. I don't believe my existence benefits society for any reason at all. I have come to the conclusion that the world has passed me by and will just keep on going. I do not feel like I can relate to anyone, yet I still try, with a small shred of hope, to make a connection(such as starting this thread). I've been alive for about 1/3rd of my lifespan and I am sick to death of how things go on. It seems to me that hurtful things happen to good people without much rhyme or reason to explain them. It seems like royal a**h***s have the best of luck at anything they do. Is this purely an issue of confidence? I think not. I believe it's more of an issue of greed and selfishness. Am I being selfish for believing I don't belong here? I don't think so. I've looked at the problem rather logically: 1.I am a burden of one type or another on a lot of people. 2. I don't like it here. 3. With a lot of patience, medications, and talk over the years, I have come to the same conclusion, based upon a lack of being able to find a suitable compromise. Was I just born to be the world's doormat? Am I not allowed to make mistakes, but must absolutely and immediately be understanding of others' mistakes? As I mentioned before, there is still that shred of hope that I can figure all of this out. But for now, it is as my thread title says, I feel like I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't.",

After second surgery i knew i had a couple of months to heal so i thought last chance to get help. would have no pressure from work or responsibiltys. At first could not find a therapyst. I have been to a few that did no good so i wanted a good one. Good ones are booked. I found one an hour away from home but it took two months to find her and get a time slot. I went to about six sessions. Because of the drive i could only go once a week so we did a hour and a half session. $300.00 a session money i do not have. She is good but a day or two after i would be right back were i started so each session was like starting over. The only way is twice a week. Now back at work and deep in dept from three months off of work i can not take off two days a week or even come close to paying over $400 a week plus the meds she says i need and the $200 a month for that doctor. I hate my job and the stress is bad and work is slow not making a living wage if it picks up the stress will double. Not the enviromnet to get over depression. A month ago i took a drive to the hills to kill myself, gun this time no more failed attempts, but i did not do it. I called the suicide hot line what a joke that was. Problem is i have a 12 year old daughter and i dont want to do this to her. We dont talk much havent for a while i isolate myself from them but i know it wont be good for her. I am at the point again were death is the lesser of two evils. I can not afford help and i can not do it on my own. This is my last effort for a different plan any advice? I am going to kill myself on tuesday",

I had a very bad childhood full of emotional and physical abuse and one day when I was 13 a girl came to school with a bandage around her wrist. Rumors flew around class that she had tried to kill herself over the weekend and my first thought was fear. She came into the room and I saw the white bandage and could smell the distinct scent of ointment and something in my head just kicked in...I wondered what it would be like to slit my wrists...to die...to go to Heaven. From that moment on I flirted more and more with the idea of killing myself and, at the same time, I began to feel depressed. In no time my thoughts were consumed with suicide. For 10 years straight, every waking moment all I could think about was how much I wanted to die.

So, removing the metaphysical ""what's the purpose of life"", what standard should I set myself against? Lacking the metaphysical, lets use the natural world.

Not that I've had bad women, quite the opposite, just that every complication that I couldn't have imagined has become my life. I've just now finally realized that women are the same as cocaine, expensive and make you feel great, but not permanently and coming down is much much more painful than any drug I've come accross. Women aren't the sole cause, they just end up escorting me to rock bottom once you pile on the realizations that people are selfish ignorant garbage as a quick generalization.",

838,I wanted to curl up in a little ball. ok. at the moment. i am overwhelmed with so many different feelings that i want to just run. run until my legs give out.,
839,"It's a mess Sometimes I can see the world from far away, as if I were standing on the surface of the moon, and I can see the Earth moving tremendously fast - imagine if the speed by which the Earth travels around the sun were the speed that the sun traveled around the center of the galaxy. And when things are moving this fast, I can see very far back in time, to the moment that the first organisms developed in the ocean and soon began to crawl on land - and this is all seen at lightning-fast speed, remember - and then life spreads accross Earth like a fungus or a moss, a giant biologically-diverse lichen that thrives by coastal, fertile regions but can be sustained also in environments of extreme heat, cold, wetness and dryness. I see all this and I don't feel any different from a tree or a wolf or a goddamned dandelion. In theory this is a beautiful feeling. But the expectations upon me are quite different from that of a tree or a wolf or a dandelion. Not only am I expected to do the big things - graduate college, get a decent job, find a decent house, marry a decent woman and raise decent children - but all the little things that fill up every moment in the interim. Talking, for example: I'll have to talk almost every day of my life until I die. I'll have to engage in conversation and talk about how this is doing or how that is doing and what needs to be done about this and what seems wrong about that. I'll have thousands of questions asked by people I don't want to give answers to; and in all probability, I'll often ask questions to people who would rather not give the answers to me. Both experiences are enough to warrant the Big Quit. I have panic attacks on what may be a regular basis, and I don't expect them to stop without medication - but is it wiser to curb the panic attacks, or their source? Ideally I would live a life where I entertained no thoughts and had extremely limited interaction with the human world. So I could become Taoist or Buddhist and meditate in the ruins of an ancient hillside monastery. Or I could wait out what is most certainly a dark phase that comes with being 22 and pretty soon I'll fall in love or something pleasant like that and forget all about the tremendous, crushing beauty of the structure of life on this planet. We are organisms at the end of the day, and my job is to pass on my specific strain of DNA into the big machine so it may determine what organic strategy is best for the present. And once I do, my job will be done, and I will bend down on my hands and knees so my genetic likeness can spring forward from my back and fly into the big mess. I can't kill myself and I can't kill anyone else, so do I let my mind tear itself apart and meanwhile maintain a fragile facade of contentness? Or maybe I do kill myself, like I've thought about; I've tested attaching my belt to the ceiling; I've held the knife against my wrists and the sharp pressure on my skin; I've pretended to jump off bridges for the amusement of my friends, the joke always rising first from desire; I even wrote a song once, while drunk, about jerking the wheel. Many of my friends tell me I think too much when I try to talk about the nature of life on Earth because of the conclusions I come to - but to ignore it would feel like surrender. Maybe if I wait a bit longer all the things that seem terrible will make some kind of poetic-galactic sense. Either way, the days keep getting worse.",

A big part of my depression is my lack of ability to have a serious relationship over the past 25 years. I don't know if this is the root cause of the depression or a side effect of it. I thought in my younger days that in order to attract women, I need to be the best person I can be. I've managed to be fairly successful. I'm a professor and I'm pretty well known in my field. I stay in pretty good shape, enough to complete in crossfit competitions. But frankly, my work and my other pursuits don't bring me any joy anymore.

I have never been able to find the man of my dreams, have the friends I wanted to have, have the education I wanted or the family life. I have always been treated very badly at home by my mother who is mentally ill but mostly doesn't care about anyone but herself and is an oscar winning actress. She has managed to single handedly ruin my life and has gathered other family members to promote hatred to me. My former illness is brought on by stress, like all other illnesses. THe problem is that I was always told that there is absolutely nothing wrong with me, I am very healthy, or I am very sick and was taken advantage of. The illness affected my memory, my motivation, my life in every way. I had no idea that I was so sick. In this country they just remove organs and dispose of them without fixing the problem and it only makes people more sick. I have had so much trouble with work, no employer wanted to hire me because my skin was so pale that my lips were blue. I was so sick and when my dad passed my mom swindled all of my money from me. I had nothing left. I had to live with her, but that's the reason that she did it, she could care less about getting help for her own problems and always said that I was the one that was sick in the head, she just aims to hurt me and takes pleasure in my pain.

She's been traveling all over the world, but the depression still haunts her, despite the fact that she feels she should be happy.

My brother was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and is 25 nearly 26 now and still lives with us. He just sits around and complains about how the world is and no one loves him and how he is being watched by the NSA and all that. My mom has been depressed ever since my dad left her for someone else so she doesn't really care about anything anymore. I have no friends and so basically I don't really have anyone to talk to. My self esteem is practically non existent, however I've tried things like exercising and meeting new people to help with that but it doesn't really work. I'm most self conscious about how I look, I'm 5'2 which is extremely short and the girl I dated for a year recently told me she had been cheating on me with other guys because I wasn't good looking enough to satisfy her lust and that she dated me for the emotional support that she needed. I can't be too mad about this though because I should have expected it. It was a blessing that someone like that was ever with me. I can't talk to anyone because they all have too much to deal with right now and to them I'm the only 'normal' and 'happy' one. To sum up, I just want to die. Please help.",

Just wondering how you go about the will since I read you need witnesses when you sign it and to make sure someone fills your last wishes.. which you can't really cause then people would suspect you are going to kill yourself and try to stop you... Not that I really have alot, but I would like whatever savings and values I have sold and put towards my pets or if they are no longer around donate anything left to charity or something.",

Nothing brings me pleasure, i feel empty, worthless, some people may call it depression, but im just saying it how it is. Im being honost with myself. The only thing preventing me from dying is because it would crush my moms heart. It is considered ""selfish"" to take my own life because I am hurting the few people who actually care about me. Well when am i going to start doing things that r better for me and not for other people. The good in life doesnt outweight the bad so whats the point. Sure life can be great if ur smart, good looking, charismatic, charming, hard working... but im none of these things. For me, i have already passed the prime of my life, when i was a kid. Not a care in the world i could just have a good time, not worry about money, girls, careers, school, me... those days r long gone. I am 19 and life has been worse every day. Whats the point of living this bad life if ur just going to die anyways. Why not speed up the process? Because I am going to burn in hell if I kill myself?? Well, i dont believe and god, and if he is real, then he is cruel and i wouldnt want to be in his presense in heaven. I just dont know what to do anymore, I could change things, but it just doesnt seem like its worth the trouble. Once i fix my current problems which will take a long time and will be a terrible process, im just going to have more problems to deal with. Its a never ending cycle, until u die at least. So y not die now? I wish i was never born... i was an accident anyways so maybe i wasnt supposed to be here.",

On the other hand i make it a priority to be a logical person to a T on the surface! I do a good job and keeps my work intact and friends to an extent...on the other hand im very emotional introspectively and emotional with my family and close relationships. Im troubled with my self image and as a result struggle with close relationships and my family. I try ignore that side of me and just get by day to day but i eventually come back to looking at myself and its ugly. I end up depressed and anxious and extreme paranoia! The paranoia is what scares me! This is may seem ridiculous but i become paranoid of getting sick or disease especially lethal or STD's Ive practiced safe sex and been tested partner or two ago. The logical step is to test all the time as it may not show up first couple. But regardless of logical answer for that emotionally i feel dead. I guess i should be alone in that regard if i fear. On flip side cancer could happen to anyone scares me. Im sorry to write this if anyone thinks im overreacting but my emotions are acting irrational and i dont know how much longer i can resist! With suicide so common seems like its not entirely bad to rule it out logically speaking. I understand that it may be the only way to correct this situation. My life isnt entirely bad though just my emotions i don't get it! My family shoots me down everytime i try to talk to them because they look at me at being myself or weak. Doctor looks at me like a disease or a drug. Friends have no opinion or don't realize i think they have there own business. The world might look at me like a statistic thats scary.

THe problem is that I was always told that there is absolutely nothing wrong with me, I am very healthy, or I am very sick and was taken advantage of. The illness affected my memory, my motivation, my life in every way. I had no idea that I was so sick. In this country they just remove organs and dispose of them without fixing the problem and it only makes people more sick. I have had so much trouble with work, no employer wanted to hire me because my skin was so pale that my lips were blue. I was so sick and when my dad passed my mom swindled all of my money from me. I had nothing left. I had to live with her, but that's the reason that she did it, she could care less about getting help for her own problems and always said that I was the one that was sick in the head, she just aims to hurt me and takes pleasure in my pain. She makes a point out of causing me so much grief that I shake from the stress and she just smiles and laughs, and punches herself in the breast then tells everyone that I am the one hurting her.

I'm really worried about him though because he says that thinking about me not being here makes him really depressed and I'm afraid that he might try to commit suicide while I'm away. I don't think there's anyone in his life that I can talk to about it that would stay cool about it and watch over him to make sure he's content and I don't know what to do other than reassure him that I'll stay faithful and talk to him everyday.

All I have are lots of people who want to use me. If I disappeared tomorrow nobody would notice or really care. Sure some people would say ""what a waste"" but they would be fine without me. Probably wouldn't even cry. There's more love here on the Internet than in real life. The bills are ever present and overwhelming. There's no escape. There's no real happiness anywhere. To know you mean nothing to anyone is pretty harsh. I used to believe that it was a sin to kill myself but now I don't know that I believe in God so its less of a deterrent. So I'm lying here in bed thinking about killing myself and not feeling as concerned about it as I think I should. Just very dispassionately and logically about mechanisms.",

A contract Milker. The owners are not on the property or hardly around, that is a nice thing, something you dont get too often. When you know you are doing everything you can you don't want the owner looking over your shoulder saying 'Why didnt you tell me about this' when his response would have been to do the action i took. My man of 4 years i met dairy farming for his parents. Before that i was in a stable relationship of 3 years and befreo that, like young and underage, i was promiscuous and a workaholic. I dont even know how to describe how i have gotten where i am. and maybe there is no point and im just writing a piece of crap history in my life that wont help and i just have to keep going? Im afraid of the pain of commiting suicide and im afraid of the person it will hurt. I think i Love him still. but sometimes he is my problem. he is a dairy farmer: contract milker: on the same farm. we are in a contract together making us completely equal. but we are never equal. i hate bagging on him so ill start with the good parts. he is really handy with his hands, like can fix anything (when he wants), if i cant do something ion farm and ask for his help (there might be an argument) but he can get it finished or help me achieve to get it finished. he is better at curing rotten milk cows than me. and i USE to learn things from him. but 3 years ago when we left his parents farm we went contract milking: he has been dairying since he was born so has more practical knowledge than i will ever gain. and he thought it was the right step. but half way through the year it was me feeding the cows, me making sure the fertilizer was on at the correct time to have feed for the cows, me doing the mating detection to be ready for artificial insemination, me raising the calves, me getting up every morning to make sure everything was working like clockwork. im slightly one of those likes to be organized people. also he inhales the horrible green plant. that i hate with an almighty passion. i think that is what makes him lethargic. anyway im off point i just lose track and mumble. there are so many different issues that have put me into this stage of my life. childhood, adolesence, young adulthood. half my life is over.

It is a selfish act because my family would be devastated, along with a few friends, but I really don't want to live.

In grade 9 my parents decided we were all going to move, for no reason either. My dad wasn't going to switch jobs or anything, and there was nothing this new place could offer but a ""fresh start"" as my mother put it. Some fresh start- my whole life restarted pretty much. A new home, new school, new friends, a new life; I had no say in the matter what so ever. In the months before the move I became anorexic, trying to grasp at least one thing I could control- my weight.

People at work made false allegations agaisnt me that I was not helping them out and that I was listening to music and not doing my job.

I feel that if I commit suicide I dont have to deal with this anymore and not have to endure being stabbed like Julius Ceasar or crucified by Jesus by people who are supposed friends. What kind of life can I live after this traumatic experience? I'll always live in fear about trusting people and will end up isolated from the world, this trauma has made me scared of the world and of starting all over in a new job.

Its just being obsessed with your partner makes it really difficult when you break-up. I still to this day cant see myself being with anyone else. Its like completely blocked out. I still have to fight with myself to not do anything stupid because i still want to get back with her. I dont talk to her and really have no desire to because the person she is now isnt who she was when i was with her. Its just doesnt seem like i can get over how she used to be with me. I still am not able to deal with the fact that she has been with someone else. I still dont know how to deal with the fact that even when she is with him she still thinks about me. I know she isnt over me but she cant deal with it. I guess i knew i dont know anymore. I basically did everything i could to make the relationship work. I basically probably ended up doing everything on my own because it seemed like she didnt. I dont even know how to describe it but ill just say all the fights i had to work out between us. I had to basically know her better than she knew herself to know what she was thinking so i could know what she was thinking to figure out how to work things out.,

Basically i've got issues which i really hate and that bother me, and i haven't quite figured out what to make of them or how to solve them, anyway the idea that i can figure my self out and change my life and my ways to find happiness is keeping me going at this point, the thing is i see my future as going two ways, succeeding or failing, im either going to work out my issues and find some direction, or else im gonna find myself at the same place i am now 10 years from now, if that the case i definitely see suicide as happening. I know its never an answer to problems but if in fact my life looks the same as it does now, if my issues are still unresolved and i still cant find happiness well then i will commit suicide simply because i dont want my life anymore, its wont be that im trying to solve my problems at that point if no progress has been made on my part i wouldnt see them as problems anymore just facts of my life that wont change, if thats the case well then i truly dont want to live as me anymore. I hope that doesnt happen and i wish i had the optimism to say that I KNOW! its not gonna be the case because i wont let it! unfortunately life continues to remind me that its real, not some fairytale where hard work is always rewarded and good people always prosper, the real world consists of good people getting hit by cars and evil people making millions, theres really no moral balance or guidelines to how the hands in life are dealt, sometimes your given a bad hand, sometimes your given a good hand, sometimes you can turn a bad hand into a good hand, sometimes you can work all your life to change your bad hand into a good one but realize that it doesnt always workout, the world has no balance or fairness, Karma is BS, fundamentalist are dreamers, wake up, life is living,moving, organic, its doesnt play by rules or ideas or romantic words, it goes where ever its pushed, im sorry im so cynical today, but my life is very cynical",
1049,"Hopeless i just don't think i can keep holding on, trying to make things better anymore. because nothing i've done has worked. it doesn't matter if i'm in a relationship, have lots of friends or just a few, love my job or hate it, spend time by myself or with people i care about.. write out how i feel, or keep it to myself. it doen't matter how logically i think things through. nothing seems good or fun. the first thing i think about in the morning is killing myself, the first emotion i feel is just so much hurt. i've been skipping all my university classes because i can't bare the thought of going anywhere. i've been skipping work because i don't want my boss (who is my friend) to see how depressed i am.. i want to quit school, stop giving myself any sort of excuse to keep trying and looking for reasons to live. i won't go to the doctor. why not, you ask? what do i have to lose? whatever self respect i have left.",

1061,going to do it ok lets see how complicated i can make my life. im a girl in England and 14 years old but sometimes it feels like i feel my life is already over. I googled the word lonely this morning and found this site and i feel like this is where i belong. I live in social care as my family arent able to look after me (if you can call them a family!) and i split up with my boyfriend as all he eva did was hit me and tell me im worthless and not good for anything. Ive never had any proper friends and no one eva says anything nice about me. I dont want to live anymore because i know theres no point. im unhappy all the time and all i want to do is cut myself and hurt myself so i can see the blood and know its hurting in front of me. is there anyone feeling like me? i dont think so! so all i want to do is finish it all. ive made up my mind and no one is going to make me change my mind so dont even anyone try. so ive made up my mind and now i just want to find out the best and easiest and most least painful way of killing myself. I sometimes think of jumping off somewhere and it will all be over. but then i tihnk I want to take an overdoes so they can find me and realise how guilty they should all feel. I dont want to be found when i haven't died as that would make things just worse. But I dont want to die alone. I want to do it properly and I want someone to show me how or tell me what I need to do. My family wont care and its not surprising as they never did care when I was alive so let them feel guilty about what they did to me. that is all that is left!,

1066,Father Committed Suicide - How to cope? Back in February my Dad shot himself he had been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and depressed because his GF had taken all his money and left him alone - He had been threatening for over a year to shoot himself and I didn't really believe he would go through with it. I visited him a few times but not many he and I did not have a good relationship after my parents divorced he stole my Mom's car and had our house foreclosed on right after I got out of high school - but he was lonely and I felt bad so I visited him a few times- He was in the hospital right before he did and I didn't go up to see him I was in the state going out with some of my high school friends and I didn't want to be depressed by him- awful right but he was a lot to take very negative and hard to deal with - while in the hospital he had threatened to kill himself so they transferred him to a city hospital who he convinced he was sane and they let him out and 8 days later he's dead - I keep having nightmares were I see him dead face down on the floor and it's really vivid and I haven't been able to sleep much and on top of that Im having problems with my BF and I guess maybe it's stress- but how have other people coped with suicide? That's my General Question I suppose -,

Where am I heading to, is it a beautiful place? Is it something I want, will I regret it? Everything I've done has put me in a special place in life, a place where I wonder if I had only taken the last left turn would I be somewhere else? Ah... it only brings me down to the place, this shallow cold and desolate road, it brings me... I come to the place where I hide all my fears and put on a mask to show the world that I can smile and laugh but feeling so helpless and so cold when I shut my eyes. Every dream, every step, a permanent reminder of what has happened to me and why it has happened. Only to lead me to this path, a road that has no end, a road that blinds me with such agony and such pain. Emotions crawl inwards up my skin as the reaper sharpens his scythe, staring at my cold empty blue eyes, that are only dark with tears that haunt every inch of what is left of me. Is it right? Is it wrong... Where will I go... do I get a second chance? A second chance... It is what makes my blood pump with hope and keeps me moving throughout my bitter cold and empty roads. This path... I feel like I can just end it, take a nap, then I can finally find my peace in a world that feels so unscathed. Unscathed by the agony of truth, unscathed by the bitterness of cold reality. The world, a desolate and cold fate, the world, a dark and dreary empty place where hope is given to those who have the strength to find it. Where is my hope... where did my dreams go... Oh...that's right... They went away because of my weakness. My inability to grow, my inability to change fast enough, my dreams.... If only I had looked at the world right the first time, if only I had gazed with the eyes I have now could I have taken that other road.... But this path....I see no other turns, only a dead end. Is it the end for me.... It feels cold... my skin feels cold... my heart aches. Is it wrong for me to be selfish? Can I please be selfish? Just this once.... I'll turn to you, and I'll smile with up-most vigilence as I slowly slip the veil of deceit into my mouth. I am cold... I feel so cold.... I have yet to make a move, I wonder if it because I am scared of what will happen.... Where I am going.... why I am going there....

Is it wrong... Where will I go... do I get a second chance? A second chance... It is what makes my blood pump with hope and keeps me moving throughout my bitter cold and empty roads. This path... I feel like I can just end it, take a nap, then I can finally find my peace in a world that feels so unscathed. Unscathed by the agony of truth, unscathed by the bitterness of cold reality. The world, a desolate and cold fate, the world, a dark and dreary empty place where hope is given to those who have the strength to find it. Where is my hope... where did my dreams go... Oh...that's right... They went away because of my weakness. My inability to grow, my inability to change fast enough, my dreams.... If only I had looked at the world right the first time, if only I had gazed with the eyes I have now could I have taken that other road.... But this path....I see no other turns, only a dead end. Is it the end for me.... It feels cold... my skin feels cold... my heart aches. Is it wrong for me to be selfish? Can I please be selfish? Just this once.... I'll turn to you, and I'll smile with up-most vigilence as I slowly slip the veil of deceit into my mouth. I am cold... I feel so cold....

I know what I want So why is it wrong? Why is almost every suicide attempt treated the same? Every time I go to therapy or to those hospitals after a 5150, all I hear is about how things get better. How I might get through this. The gist is they think those feelings will settle down enough for me to live a life and finally see the bright colors of life one day. They think I just want to do this because of a momentary laps in judgment. I want this. I want to die and the only reason I'm not now is because they made the easiest and most effective ways to carry this out impossible for me. They made it so I can be ""Saved"" ff I try again on pills, cutting, or some other slow method of death. I do not want to be saved. I do not want to go into this then wake up in some hospital. I do not want to one day wake up from this and be put into a life with even more hurdles and disabilities, or even just be put in a coma. I do not want to became even more burdening to someone else. I just want to die. To do it in a way I cant come back, and a way I wont wake up to even more hardships to bare for myself and those around me. Why does everyone say its wrong for me to want this? That its wrong for me to try and carry this out on my own? I just wish to fade out. I've worked now for so long just to put myself in a position where me just dying and disappearing will have the least amount of emotional strain on those around me.

Then She just lied there and began talking about her life being worthless and that she would always stay with me in my heart. When I realized she was talking about suicide, I panicked. I apologized again and I tried to convince her she was a wonderful person and I was the fool. She looked awful like a body without soul, I couldn't help crying and then she reacted a little.

1148,my epic fail So im 22 years old I have had many suicidal thoughts. I have done almost everything like cutting my wrists down the road trying to bleed out and i even tried to cut so deep to my femoral vein in my leg to bleed out.I ended up not going deep enough and stitches. I have researched options like drinking household items or eat rat poison. I decided on non of those because I could just end up on life support and that would be worse. I would get in fights with my boyfriend and have him tell me he doesn't want me. Most of the time that triggers this emotion like if he doesn't want me I dont want to be in this world. I wanted an easy way out. So a little background is I do have a drug problem im not currently talking to a therapist of anything. I have been very broke and decided I will find a way to mess myself up so bad Ill need painkillers for a long while. Some I could sell and some that I could get high. So I made a deal with a few friends to break my knee I told them I would give them part of the pills i get so they could sell em and make money. First I had my friend swing a metal pipe at my knee 4 times well she missed a couple and hit my shin. I read that a blow to the knee can tear ligaments.,

1152,"Still not over it after 18 years. When I was six years old, my dad killed himself. Everyone tells me I am better off, and I believe them. From what I remember of him, he was always very angry. He never really gave me much attention except to yell at me for something. It was very rare if he ever actually played with me. Whenever I cried about something, if I were hurt or something he would get impatient with me. If he was at home, and I wanted to be with him, he would get impatient with me. I only have a few happy memories of him. Sometimes I kind of wonder if he resented me. Him and my mother only got married because he got her pregnant with me. Plus my mom had my older sister, so he was doing the right thing I guess by giving her a father and staying for my sake. However, from what I've heard he didn't really want kids at that age. He was 21 and my mom was 20.",
1153,"i need some help this is my first post, so i'll try to be brief. i don't feel like i have any true friends. yes, i have some people i talk to and see outside of school, but when it comes to stuff like that, i'm always the second person. what i mean by that is unless it's me and one other person talking one-on-one, no one even acknowledges the fact that i'm a part of the conversation. i'm not a first priority in anyone's eyes. i also am not to fond of my life as a whole. i see others in the hall ways, enjoying school, enjoying their friends, enjoying their life. then i get jealous and start to wonder ""why is my life not even filled with the slightest amount of happiness/fun"". i always find myself sulking around, trying to talk to people (but obviously in vain). i just feel that i suffer the most, work the hardest, try to be the nicest, be the best listener, and i always get the short end of the stick; i never get any appreciation. and of course the one thing i want the most (or pretty much everyone for that matter) is to be in a loving relationship. i never feel that i'm more than ""just casual friends"" with classmates, girls, anyone. add all these factors plus my incredibly negative personality and depression problem, and you get the basics of my daily life. but the thing is i know these people care about me, i just never see it displayed/on at least a semi regular basis. i just want to feel like i matter to people.",

I am dating one girl for almost half a year now, we never really get along, but we managed to go on, about 2 months back she had to go to other town (we were already living far apart, but now even more), we still were talking through skype/phone with baying apart she started to get more depressive and started to do self harm, she was doing before but I tried to help her, so she was not doing for all the time until that time ~2 months ago, and she started doing it so badly and something broke into me... I was thinking that I was helping her and it all was just even worse so I started to have my own depression, for last 2 months we argued a lot she even blocked me in skype several times, then gone back next day. I turned really bad too, when I have depression I cant do anything, I cant tell anything, do anything, because of that it went to even larger problems, but then we had bigger argument and we did not talk for 2 or 3 days, then kinda started again, then I found out that one of her ""friends"" will be coming over, the things is that friend was her ex, she did not say me, but she posted it somewhere, so as I saw them talking and clearly she was hitting on him. 2 days after that she started to wrote to me again and later that day she asked if I will love her no matter what, I said ""only thing I would never forgive is cheating"" then after some time same day she told she had sex with her ex, but she resisted and did not want it. The thing is I knew something like that may have happened, because some time back she had one more friend with her who was trying to touch her, but she said no (that is what she told me) even if ""she actually wanted to have sex, but she will wait till we can again"".",

I tried to kiss her again and she was trying to avoid it but I kept trying. Then all of a sudden she starts crying. I was shocked, I didn't know what to do. I apologized repeatedly and when she calmed down she was a different person. She told me she felt something broke inside of her but she didn't know what was it. Then She just lied there and began talking about her life being worthless and that she would always stay with me in my heart. When I realized she was talking about suicide, I panicked. I apologized again and I tried to convince her she was a wonderful person and I was the fool. She looked awful like a body without soul, I couldn't help crying and then she reacted a little. I held her and then help her up. I told her to believe me when I said she was wonderful, then I told her that together we were going to be alright . She seemed a little better but only a little. I had to go so I left her. I texted her yesterday and today, she didn't answer. I read she posted something on facebook several hours ago, it was a normal post.

1188,"Why are people always so negative about the idea of committing suicide? Personally , I think that committing suicide can be in a lot of cases be the most rational and therefore the right thing to do , I mean think about it ? you're gonna die anyway , if you have some definitive evidence that your life is going to either be an awful one or,in the best case scenario,be just a one that's not really that good or interesting , then what's the point of living this sort of life , why not just end it right now and save yourself the effort . And even if you think that this ain't true and that somehow there's hope , then still , this hope that things could get better is just a possibility countered by an almost equal other possibility that things are never really going to be that good. I personally am fond of the idea of killing myself . The only thing stopping me is this stupid and irrational survival instinct we all have as living organisms. If I'm able to defeat it , then I wouldn't even give it a second thought and just do it , just end it right there.People always say that ""it's not worth it"" . I agree with that statement except I think that nothing is really worth living for because it's all really destined to end eventually . If you were able to do or create something that the whole entire earth population would glorify you for , you're still gonna die , the entire human race which you served there is gonna be wiped out too, and all what will be left is nothing , just pure nothing,so what's the point then? I'm not gonna do it , just to be clear , however, if I could I would. .Anyway what do you guys think about this .",

1190,"4 years Well where do I begin, I am 22 and when I was 16 I got my first real girlfriend, we were young and silly together it was a good time, the best time. Well after 2-3 years things got tired and I broke it off, I thought at the time it was the best thing for both of us as we were both beginning university. Anyway within a week I missed her alot so I thought mabye her feeling the same would get me another shot. I was wrong, she had already hooked up with some guy from her work and I was dropped altogether. I went through a phase of constantly emailing her begging to get her back and even bumped into her once on a bus when I proceeded to journey with her all the way to her workplace where we agreed to be friends (this for me was just a way to get back in to the fold). Anywayher promise of friendship was never manifested and she basically made it clear I was not wanted anymore. This killed me at the time a huge pain was born and I wanted to die. Anyway I had some steady friends and I managed to soldier on applying a mask of sanity. We've not spoke for 4 years unti last week when she suddenly felt guilty for still talking to her new ex (the guy she left me for) and not speaking to me so now we're firends? I played it cool for 6 days then e-mailed her suggesting a quiet drink to catch up and she still hasn't replied meaning she wont. I also found out today that after her last breakup she had some sort of one night stand and this was a new killer blow, the climax of the tragic movie where she runs back to me after seeing how bad things are without me didn't happen. She done the right thing and evolved into a notch on a bedpost. None of this would be a problem were it not for the constant numb pain and the ill feeling everytime I see or hear from her. I still live with my parents but I now see three options. End the pain using the most definite methods, leaving the country or........no make that two options. My only question is, is 4 years a natural term of breakup pain? I expected to have moved on long ago yet I still pine and think of her everyday. I would appreciate opinions.",

I haven't attempted it yet, because I want to wait until my death won't hit my family so hard. Right now, everybody's having too much fun doing too many things; I don't want to ruin it.

At the age of 49 I was planning my own but I wasn't going to just make an attempt. As a nurse I knew anatomy and it wasn't going to be a big deal. I felt the last resort for help was to let my adult children and husband know what I had in mind and that would save me, or at least make them aware that I was troubled. The result was that they blew me off. They seemed like they were scared not of my potential suicide, but of me, they stayed away. Not what I expected. My now ex spouse had shifted my children's perspective of me at very young ages, as he would ask them at times if it was 'safe' to enter the house as I was grieving over a family members death. Their response angered me to the point I buckled down and put my anger to work. I used a tool I had been using for others for years in my nursing career and it was the save for me. We call it a nursing care plan. We use it for patients to determine nursing problems, to identify our end goal and identify measures to achieve our result.",

I feel left out all the time wanting to be a part of a group of friends but no one wants a weird pimply faced girl with nappy hair and no sense of style. I've had suicidal thoughts and I can't stop...I don' think I'd ever have the ability to do anything but I want my depression and suicidal thoughts to go away. I've never had a best friend and the only person who has come close told me straight up that I would never be her best friend. I'm about to lose my boyfriend he says i need to ""take some responsibility for my * * * * ing self"" but I don't know what that means I'm a very responsible person I pay my bills, I've got a job I just have no friends. I'm tired I was supposed to die when I was born and I wish so hard that I would have but because I can't change the past I try to slowly kill myself with cigarrettes. I don't know how to make friends. How do you make friends? how do you meet random people is it stupid to go up to someone and ask them to be your friend? I am so lame. I just wanted to see if anyone else had the same issues that they feel they're life is going no where and that there is no point cause that's how i feel i just want to sit around and smoke out. I want to laugh like i used to and I can't find it anymore.....it's like my whole being has changed into someone i don't recognized. Does anyone know of a psychiatrist or therapist chat room? ](*,)",

I think about suicide all the time and I made myself promise that I would wait at least a year, but it is getting harder and harder to do so. Bottom line is, I want love. I want it so badly, and yet I just cannot seem to find it. Instead, I seem to have heartbreak after heartbreak, and I don't know why. I am not a bad person: I'm pretty, funny, fun to be around, I have lots of friends, and lots going for me. I'm not saying this to brag, I'm merely trying to point out that I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. What makes matters worse is that there are plenty of guys who want to go out with me, I do get asked out quite a bit, in fact I tend to get guys who obsess with me and call me all the time, email me all the time, etc, even after I politely tell them I am not interested. It just hurts me because I get ""why on earth are you still single"" from guys all the time, it's just from the ones I'm not interested in.",
1260,Depressed and alone I feel completely useless. Im empty and alone. I don’t feel like anyone cares or anyone wants me. I’ve been in this black cloud for what It seems like forever. Im fighting so hard to stay alive but for what? Fighting hard for what purpose? Everyone Is so selfish. I’ve given so much to people that I’ve met but not one person does the same in return. Maybe I should be selfish and just be gone from this world and pain I’ve been living in. Sorry I don’t mean to be gloomy just in a dark and painful place. Needed somewhere I can just talk and be real with.,

1263,Im drowning in my own emotions i have finally told my coucellor about my fathewr and what he did to me but im drowning in mixed emotions the only good thing that has come out of telloing her is that she now says that she can understand the suicidal thoughts ive had that ive been trapped for years ith no where to go so suicide is a clear option,
1264,"Is it worth it? I am here because I don't know where else to be. I don't want to burden anyone with my thoughts but I can't write them down fast enough. In my short 32 years, I have lost my father to a tragic accident, had my best friend/adopted little sister murdered, had a friend commit suicide and many more deaths and tragedies. I was anorexic and lucky for me it was caught early, doesn't seem so lucky to me now I am fat and ugly and unwanted. If you have seen the movie ""Twilight"" you will understand a little what I am thinking. There is this amazing relationship between Edward and Bella and that is what I need. I feel so drawn to the characters it's not even funny, I feel a lot like Bella, odd and ordinary. I am nothing spectacular and have been verbally abused my whole life. I am having a hard time just getting my butt out of bed. To have human affection would greatly help me, just being touched gently or kissed or hugged. But with society the way it is, I don't even see that possible. Why do things we humans want so bad only ever happen in movies? I haven't thought about ending my life for a few months, I was doing really good, maybe it's because I have been on and off my medication, wish I could afford it all the time. It really helps but even taking it, I am still feeling this way. I want to not kill myself, just render myself unconscious for a few days and make the world see that I am here and see if I really do have any friends. That sounds dumb too. I have a huge crush on this guy (yeah it still happens to us old farts) and he is one of the few people I can talk to when I see him. He's super kind and I find my heart twitter when I see him, that is an amazing feeling but I guess that is all it will be. I used to have penpals to write snail mail letters to and that was really good for me but nobody wants to write letters anymore, wish they did.

1267,"This is getting to be a little much Ok so ive had suicidal thoughts since i was 12 im now 19 and the thoughts are getting more often and worse. At first it was over getting picked on and i just thought instead of killing myself id join the army when i was 18 and get killed in action. Back then the thoughts only came around every once in a while throughout high school the thoughts became more and more even though i had a good life going i had friends played sports and no family problems. but for some reason i would always think that life had no meaning or no point to it. i though why live if all you do is work your ass off to get money to survive and that lifes purpose was to work just to survive the next day. but then i met this amazing and beautiful girl who changed my whole thoughts on life. she made me feel like the luckiest kid in the whole world i was able to tell her everything. i thought i would be with her forever and she said the same. she made me feel good every day and gave me hope for my life i thought i found out why life had meaning. she was the first person i told that ive thought of killing myself. she got me to tell my parents i was depressed but they dont know that i wish i was dead. well recently she broke up with me and i still cry about it i feel worthless. she pretty much took back all those wonderful words that made me feel happy. she said there is no chance of getting back together and i lost it. the only way i can even be semi happy now is to distract myself with tv, school work and golf, but the rest of the day where im not doing those things i just want to die. its not like i can keep myself preoccupied every minute of everyday for the rest of my life. and the break up is not the whole reason for these awful thoughts its just the feeling of worthlessness and life not having meaning again. people say youll get over it just stick with it but i dont believe them because the thoughts have been here for 7 years now. its become to much for me, the only reason im still here is the fear of surviving suicide and not wanting to have my parents bury me. But now the things that used to hold me back are seeming like less of a good excuse to not do it. These thoughts have affected my life to much they hold me back from doing a lot of social things and the thoughts just bring my mood down even moer. If im still here by the end of the year itll because of me not wanting to hurt my family.",
1268,"My time is up I am married with 2 girls age 17 and 9. My Husband is serial cheat, a lier, he is deceitful in every way, shape and form. Last night we had another argument. My 9 year old was upset and now its my fault. He happy of course becuase he has his cakes and eats it. I have decided this relationship is no good and as I am the one in misery and making everyone else miserable, then I should go. I could move and live somewhere else, but to do what, get a cleaning job and live in a grotty flat, no thanks. I don't know why I didn't think of this before, it was like a flashing light bulb moment but suicide is the best option for me. I would like it to be painless, yes I am a coward. I would just like to take 1 tablet and let it be then end. He will bring the bimbo in my bed quickly after, if he hasn't already I am in no doubt about that. I am staying until after Christmas (not that heartless), but I think before my birthday near the end of Jan. I don't want a funeral, people going here lies a woman who was that crap her family no longer liked her. I think we have insurance so if one of us dies then its paid off, not sure if they paid out on suicidse. Not sure if we got insurance as he controls all the moneyl so I can see who he spends all his money on. I like to be cremated do what ever they want with the ashes. I don't know why people choose their own songs at funerals, its not like you are going to be around to listen to it. I use to think people who commited suicide was selfish, especially the ones who kill their families too. But no, not anymore. I understand. We who decide we are not good enough for this life are not selfish at all. Our, especially mine, departing can only benefit. Husband gets the wife he clearly deserves. Kids get a mum who is not studying at the OU at 43 because she was not good enough at 18. A mum who can cook without the whole house knowing about it. The house who is always clean, dog always walked, get to go to all children's school events instead of going to work to pay the mortgage because he spends all his cash on her. He will have someone he is not embrassed about. Someone he can take to parties, instead of saying"" you can't come you have to study"". He will find someone that when she burns tea, breaks a cup, he won't be thinking ""If I was with so and so this will not be happening"". His new wife will be that great he won't need to have an affair in front of his daughter. His new wife won't be walking on eggs shells thinking I do something wrong he will be thinking I wish I was with her, she won't cringe when the kids argue with each other because she knows he won't he won't be thinking I wish I was with her as my life, family and marriage would be perfect. She won't have to stand next to him in the supermarket while he flirting with other bimbos, telling them that they are better than her. Yes life would be perfect when I am gone.",
1269,"Life worsens, wants to commit suicide HELP Well I am 18 years old and my life continues to worsen. I will explain a bit about myself and the reasoning behind my dark temptations of commiting such a terrible act. Ever since I was 11 years old I have suffered severe epilepsy to the point where I have grand mal (intense convulsion) seizures daily. My school has always been interrupted, constantly made fun of by other people. My memory is worsening and so is my hearing. I have had severe side effects from almost every possible epileptic medication there is and now I do not really see a point in living. Not only do I deal with seizures but I deal with other stresses such as my family which is extremely poor at the moment since one of my parents lost their job and a sibling which seems to have deep hatred for me; probably because they haven't matured and may be jealous of the attention I receive for having such a disorder. I still am not sure. But I hate my life. I have called suicide hotlines and everything but I truly just hate myself.",

Im living a life to survive and thats it. I cant get any joy or feel good about anything because something happens and just ruins it. Its like just me talking about my life is depressing so people just because of that wont say anything. Its like all these dead ends that dont lead anywhere. Im supposed to live my life and just deal with whatever happens but how do you do that when your life is unbearable.,

My parents and family will move on, so I don't feel bad about leaving them, my friends will soon forget about me. So really I have nothing to live for. I have please my parents already by going to university and getting the education they wanted me to get. I have never been able to follow my dreams and do what I wanted to do.

I just need to find the strength to take my own life. Life has no meaning when you have no one to talk to, to confide in, to trust with your most intimate secrets. I can't tell my parents, they are too judgemental to understand and I'm pretty sure my friends don't care.

1292,"Prozac linked to suicide -- warning Today in school we were having discussions about current events going on in the world. We started talking about how water over in the UK drinking water is contaminated with the anti-depressent drug known as Prozac. A large portion of people in the UK take Prozac ( I think around 30% of the population) and the water and sewage treatment plants do not recognize Prozac so they do not try to take it out of the water (although they are now going to star upgrading the facilities). If you drink enough water you will feel the effects of the Prozac. Also, since Prozac hasn't been around very long, doctors are just finding out now that when younger children take Prozac it causes them to have suicidal tendencies ( I dont know how young they mean.. teens? preteens? younger?) There have already been lawsuits against Prozac by families who have lost their children to suicide related to the drug. I dont want this post to get lengthy so I'll just finish up.

It doesn't go away when everything that could go right, does just that. This is thought out. I know The unfortunate people that I may hurt. I know the consequences. I know what I want So why is it wrong? Why is almost every suicide attempt treated the same? Every time I go to therapy or to those hospitals after a 5150, all I hear is about how things get better. How I might get through this. The gist is they think those feelings will settle down enough for me to live a life and finally see the bright colors of life one day. They think I just want to do this because of a momentary laps in judgment. I want this. I want to die and the only reason I'm not now is because they made the easiest and most effective ways to carry this out impossible for me. They made it so I can be ""Saved"" ff I try again on pills, cutting, or some other slow method of death. I do not want to be saved. I do not want to go into this then wake up in some hospital. I do not want to one day wake up from this and be put into a life with even more hurdles and disabilities, or even just be put in a coma. I do not want to became even more burdening to someone else. I just want to die. To do it in a way I cant come back, and a way I wont wake up to even more hardships to bare for myself and those around me. Why does everyone say its wrong for me to want this? That its wrong for me to try and carry this out on my own? I just wish to fade out. I've worked now for so long just to put myself in a position where me just dying and disappearing will have the least amount of emotional strain on those around me. I know family and friends and all that say they'll be heart broken but time heals. They will move on with their lives and carry out their dreams. They'll have their wants and I'll have mine.

Last month he threatened to kill his self. He took his gun from our closet and took off for 2 days. He was so mean about it. It wasn't like I'm so depressed I'm going to kill myself, it was like ""I'll show you and you'll feel bad for the rest of your life"". He even hand wrote out his will and gave it to me. I managed to get him home and calmed down and he seems o.k. but not better.

I have consumed obscene amounts of pills (I don't think I should say what I took, because I don't want to assist in a persons attempt.) Right now, I'm still pretty messed up from the pills. I just want ti to be over. I don't have anyone to turn to. I don't have anything to hope for. I hurt so much. SO MUCH! I don't have anyone. I HATE THIS!!! People die everyday from all sorts of things. Good people with great dreams and aspirations, so why do they die and I live? I don't ""appreciate"" life, so why do I have to live. I want so badly for someone to just end me. At this point, I'm really just thinking about how I can do this comfortably. I don't know. I want to try again, but my body aches so much from my latest attempt. My throat is dry and sore. My liver is in agony. I'm incredibly weak and have severe ataxia. Why do I have to live like this? Someone, anyone please help me.",

1353,"Please Help!!! Asap! I just got a call about a half hour ago from my ex-girlfriend that just broke up with me this last week. One of our friends we haven't seen in a year came down this last weekend when I went up and got him and he had a blast this weekend. He tried calling me tonight, but I was on the phone and I ignored it like I do to anyone that interrupts an important call. I got a call from my ex-girlfriend and she told me I needed to call him right away. That he was balling and crying like she had never heard before, and she couldn't even understand a word he was saying. I called him and he was in really bad shape. He had just punched out a window and cut his hand on the glass, I made sure it was okay and not a severe wound and it wasn't. All I could hear him say was ""I'm so scared of what I might do to myself, and I really dont want to."" He comes from a family whose father walked out on them and whose mother was very abusive. He lived down here in the cities and that's how I met him. He had to move back up north because of living expenses that he couldn't come up with anymore. He's so bent out of shape, because people are telling him to give up and that he's not worth anything, and anything he does is a waste of time. Mind you, he hasn't been suicidal since before he met me and my girlfriend - he told me we are basically his only family.",

1356,"The Life of Christopher Allen Brackner He was born premature and due to lack of oxygen, he was also the color blue. The doctors said there was a 90% chance he would be born dead or mentally handycapped. After 3 months in the hospital, he was taken home for the first time. The day he came home, his brother hit him over the head with a toy truck. That was a start of many years of physical abuse from his brother.",
1357,I want to commit suicide I am 19 years old. I have been thinking about suicide for a few years now with my first attempt when I was 12 years old. I have attempted suicide 4 times but almost all of these were a massive cry for help which I am most certainly not going to deny. I was abused in every way possible by my father from when I can remember until I was 11 years old and I have only just recently reported the incidents to the police and awaiting a trial etc. as I know I wasnt the only one he abused. I don't know if this is the reason why I am serioudly contemplating it now.,
1358,"I Think i need help I await the day I die. I sometimes think about taking my car off the road to end it all. I have already had accidents, but have only injured myself. everyday, i think of other easier ways to die. I know its selfish, i know i shouldn't. but i have had enough. I try to speed the life process more and more by drinking and smoking excessively and taking any drug i can get my hands on. last time i was in one of those moods i heard that 30 panadol are possibly lethal. I took 47, not to mention the other tabs i got my hands on... antibiotics, pure codiene, anything that had something in it. I felt incredibly sick for weeks. And got me depressed that it didn't work. I try to help people with their problems, but no one seems to think about me. i feel worthless, useless, just a waste of skin. I don't want this life anymore. thankfully i believe in reincarnation. So death doesn't worry me. I'm scared i may do something drastic soon. I'm too stubborn to see a psychiatrist. I dont open up to anyone, as i just feel like i am weighing them down with my problems.",
1359,"Leave a note or just disappear? Let me start by saying this isn't a ""cry for help"", attention play, or open forum for pity. I have spent years bearing the weight of knowing how broken I am and contemplating the solution and its ripples from all angles. This decision was not reached in haste or rage and as such was reached with resolve, however I am at a crossroads as to whether I should leave some sort of note for whoever happens to walk in to this room after I walk out. Considering I no longer really feel emotions and am unable to translate or communicate that emptiness effectively, and I really have nothing to say, the note seems pointless. Or, should I simply clean everything, donate my belongings to charity, and disappear with dignity. Thoughts?",
1360,why shouldnt i end my life why shouldnt i just give into this pain that drags me back down this little voice in my head tellin me im not good enough to be here tellin me that i should cut my self but it aint never gone that deep and i know it will one day i can feel it growin stronger i know if i try to fight it ill just lose it aint somthin you can fight off it lives and breaths inside me and i can feel it just growin deep down in my soul its like its waitin for me to give in and when it thinks i should give up and i dont it tells me to cut myself and im afraid that if i dont then somthin worse might happen like the accident.,
1361,"I don't know what to do...(a long story) Yes, I am contemplating suicide. I am 22, and I know I am young, I know there are people worse off, and I have heard all that ""It will get better"" bs. I don't want to hear those words together in the same sentence ever again. I suffer from depression and PTSD, so it makes it almost impossible to go on, day to day. I stopped living, and am just existing.",

And I dont like it, I was a very happy person no worries in the world when I was 18 - 22 but at the age off 22 my whole life changed when I lost my grandad and mum to cancer at aged 56, shortly after I was arrested for something stupid and it lost me my job I worked so hard for, I lost my brand new flat that was part of the job my world just came crashing down on me, then in April this year my first and only love (gf) dumped me and after I quit my part time job due to depression.

1365,I don't have a reason or purpose I'm a 35 year old male I was married for 18 years and my wife left me. I was so wrapped up in my depression and I never talked to her about it. Everything that I ever did I screwed up everything and I'm sick of it. I have no reason to live anymore no purpose NOTHING. I'm going to kill my self. I have to there's no other way. I don't have any friends. And I don't TRUST ANYONE. As soon as I get my will signed witch I hope will be Friday I can do this. It's the best decision I've ever made and I'm at piece with it and I'm happy about it. I'm going far into the woods I don't want to be found I don't want services. No one will probably look for me any way. I don't know what else to do I don't know how I'm supposed to feel or say,
1366,"Is suicide a reasonable option for me? I'm a 16 year old male, and my mom is an evil vindictive witch. I haven't seen my dad since I was a baby, but she got re-married to my stepdad, and now she hates me and wants to move on with her life and her new family. And please, please DON'T say I'm overreacting, because she even says that and it's plainly obvious if you observed our house for more than an hour. It's obvious to me now that natural maternal love is a lie, she tossed me aside like I was garbage ever since I was 14. She buys food for herself and her husband but buys me nothing. She tells me to drink tap water while her and her husband drink coffee and soda and smoke cigarettes and eat take out food. She doesn't give me money for a haircut or school supplies. The only way I can get these things is by selling my old video games and I'm almost out of the money I got from that. I'm wearing old clothes and everyone at school makes fun of me for it, so I have no friends. If I ask her for a drink or clothes she'll tell me to f*** off and hit me, and then when I defend myself against her she calls the cops and they take her side and act like I'm the bad guy. She told me she doesn't care if I died and couldn't wait until she could kick me out so that she would never have to see my face again unless it was in the obituaries page. And when I tell other family members about her she lies to them and they all tell me that I'm overreacting or lying. She's a really terrible person.",
